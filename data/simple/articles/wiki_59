Ramesses II

Ramesses II was the greatest Pharoah of Ancient Egypt. He was the third Pharaoh of the Nineteenth dynasty. His successors and later Egyptians called him the "Great Ancestor".

When he was 14, Ramesses was appointed successor by his father Seti I. He ruled Egypt from 1279 BC to 1213 BC. This is a total of 66 years and 2 months. It is likely that he died in his 90th or 91st year. On his death, he was buried in a tomb in the Valley of the Kings; his body was later moved to a royal cache (hidden wall slot) where it was discovered in 1881. It is now on display in the Cairo Museum.

Ramesses II led several expeditions north into the lands east of the Mediterranean (the location of the modern Israel, Lebanon and Syria). He also led expeditions to the south, into Nubia.

The early part of his reign was focused on building cities, temples and monuments. He established the city of Pi-Ramesses in the Nile Delta as his new capital and main base for his campaigns in Syria.

Early in his life, Ramesses went on campaigns to get land back from Nubian and Hittite hands, and to secure Egypt's borders. He also stopped Nubian revolts and ran a campaign in Libya. During Ramesses's reign, the Egyptian army may have included about 100,000 men, a force that he used to strengthen Egyptian influence.

In his second year, Ramesses defeated the Sherden sea pirates. They were causing problems along Egypt's Mediterranean coast by attacking cargo-laden vessels on the sea routes to Egypt. Ramesses posted troops and ships at strategic points along the coast, and allowed the pirates to attack their prey. He then caught them by surprise in a sea battle, capturing them all in a single action. A stele says they came "in their war-ships from the midst of the sea, and none were able to stand before them". Shortly afterwards Sherden are seen in the Pharaoh's body-guard with their horned helmets, round shields and the great Naue II swords.

The Hittite Mursili III fled to Egypt, after he failed to take his uncle's throne. The uncle, Hattusili III, demanded that Ramesses extradite (send back) his nephew back to Hatti.

This caused a crisis between Egypt and Hatti, when Ramesses said he did not know where Mursili was. The two empires came close to war. Eventually, in the twenty-first year of his reign (1258 BC), Ramesses decided to make an agreement with Hattusili III, to end the conflict. The document they agreed is the earliest known peace treaty in world history.

The peace treaty was recorded in two versions, one in Egyptian hieroglyphs, the other in Akkadian, using cuneiform script; both versions survive. Such dual-language recording is common to many treaties. This treaty differs from others in that the two language versions are differently worded. Although the majority of the text is identical, the Hittite version claims that the Egyptians came suing for peace, while the Egyptian version claims the reverse. The treaty was given to the Egyptians in the form of a silver plaque. This 'pocket-book' version was taken back to Egypt, and a copy carved into the Temple of Karnak.

The most important and famous of Ramesses' Queen consorts was discovered in 1904. The tomb of Nefertari is extremely important, because its magnificent wall painting is regarded as one of the greatest examples of ancient Egyptian art.

A flight of steps cut out of the rock makes it possible to go to the antechamber. This is decorated with paintings based on chapter 17 of the Book of the Dead. The astronomical ceiling represents the heavens and is painted in dark blue, with many golden five-pointed stars. The east wall of the antechamber is interrupted by a large opening with paintings of Osiris and Anubis. This leads to the side chamber, decorated with offering scenes. A vestibule with paintings shows Nefertari being presented to the gods, who welcome her. On the north wall of the antechamber is the stairway that goes down to the burial chamber. This is a vast quadrangular room covering a surface area of about , the astronomical ceiling of which is supported by four pillars entirely covered with decoration.

Governor of New South Wales

The Governor of New South Wales is the oldest political office Australia. Captain Arthur Phillip became the first Governor of New South Wales on 7 February 1788. The Colony of New South Wales was the first British settlement in Australia. The first governors had almost autocratic powers due to the distance from and poor communications with Great Britain. In 1824 the New South Wales Legislative Council, Australia's first legislature, was appointed to help the governor.

Between 1850 and 1861, the Governor of New South Wales was also called the Governor-General. All letters between the Australian colonies and the British Government were meant to go through the Governor-General. The other colonies had Lieutenant-Governors. As they became independent, South Australia in 1836, Tasmania January 1855 and Victoria May 1855 replaced their Lieutenant-Governors with Governors. Sir William Denison kept the title of Governor-General until his retirement.

The Governor acts on the advice of the head of the elected government, the Premier of New South Wales. The Governor does have power of the Crown, and has the right to dismiss the Premier. This power was last used in 1932, when Sir Philip Game dismissed Jack Lang.

If the Governor dies, resigns or is absent their duties are carried out by the Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales.

The Governor of New South Wales used Government House as a home, office and official reception space until 1996. The Governor's office is now in the historic Chief Secretary’s Building at 121 Macquarie Street.

The first Australian-born Governor of New South Wales (or of any Australian state) was Lieutenant General Sir John Northcott in 1946). All governors since then have been Australian-born except for Gordon Samuels, who was born in the United Kingdom but came to Australia at an early age. Northcott's successor, Lieutenant General Sir Eric Woodward (1957), was the first born in New South Wales.

Tarbosaurus

"Tarbosaurus" was a large carnivorous theropod dinosaur from Asia, especially Mongolia and China. It was a tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur that flourished between 70 and 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period.

"Tarbosaurus" lived in a humid floodplain criss-crossed by river channels. In this environment, it was a predator at the top of the food chain, probably preying on other large dinosaurs like the hadrosaur "Saurolophus" or the sauropod "Nemegtosaurus". 

Like its close North American relative Tyrannosaurus rex, it had a large head and powerful jaws, but was not top heavy. Its huge skull was comparatively thin and light, with large air pockets. Many of its bones were hollow, making them strong but light, so they did not add excessive weight to this large predator. Its forlimbs were small with two fingers, as with its larger relative. The small, two-fingered, front limb is absolutely distinctive of tyrannosaurids.

The three-toed hind limbs were long and thick, supporting the body in a bipedal posture. The long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso and placed the center of gravity over the hips.

Its skull was similar to that of "Tyrannosaurus", but more rigid. Also, because its skull was not so broad at the back, it did not have binocular vision like "Tyrannosaurus".

Some scientists have hypothesized that the more rigid skull of "Tarbosaurus" was an adaptation to hunting the massive sauropods found in the location, which did not exist in most of North America during the later Cretaceous.

<doc id="250677" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=250677" title="Dung beetle">
Dung beetle

Dung beetles are beetles that feed partly or exclusively on the faeces of mammals. This beetle can also be referred to as the scarab beetle. All of these species belong to the superfamily Scarabaeoidea; and most of them to the family Scarabaeidae. 

There are dung-feeding beetles which belong to other families, such as the Geotrupidae (the "earth-boring dung beetle"). The subfamily Scarabaeinae alone has more than 5,000 species.

Many dung beetles, known as "rollers", are noted for rolling dung into spherical balls, which are used as a food source or brooding chambers. Other dung beetles, known as "tunnelers", bury the dung wherever they find it. A third group, the "dwellers", neither roll nor burrow: they simply live in manure. They are often attracted by the dung burrowing owls collect.

Dung beetles live in many different habitats, including desert, farmland, forest, and grasslands. They do not prefer extremely cold or dry weather. They are found on all continents except Antarctica.

Dung beetles eat dung excreted by herbivores and omnivores, and prefer that produced by the former. Many of them also feed on mushrooms and decay]]ing leaves and fruits. One type living in South America, "Deltochilum valgum", is a carnivore preying upon millipedes. Those that eat dung do not need to eat or drink anything else, because the dung provides all the necessary nutrients. 

Most dung beetles search for dung using their sensitive sense of smell. Some of the smaller species simply attach themselves to the dung-providers to wait for their reward. After capturing the dung, a dung beetle will roll it, following a straight line despite all obstacles. Sometimes dung beetles will try to steal the dung ball from another beetle, so the dung beetles have to move rapidly away from a dung pile once they have rolled their ball to prevent it from being stolen. Dung beetles can roll up to 50 times their weight. Male "Onthophagus taurus" beetles can pull 1,141 times their own body weight: the equivalent of an average person pulling six double-decker buses full of people. In 2003, researchers found one species of dung beetle (the African "Scarabaeus zambesianus") navigates by using polarization patterns in moonlight. The discovery is the first proof any animal can use polarized moonlight for orientation. 

The "rollers" roll and bury a dung ball either for food storage or to make a brooding ball. In the latter case, two beetles, one male and one female, will be seen around the dung ball during the rolling process. Usually it is the male that rolls the ball, with the female hitch-hiking or simply following behind. In some cases the male and the female roll together. When a spot with soft soil is found, they stop and bury the dung ball. They will then mate underground. After the mating, both or one of them will prepare the brooding ball. When the ball is finished, the female lays eggs inside it. Some species do not leave after this stage, but remain to safeguard their offspring. 

The dung beetle goes through a complete metamorphosis. The larvae live in brood balls made with dung prepared by their parents. During the larval stage, the grub feeds on the dung surrounding it.

The behavior of the beetles was much misunderstood until the studies of Jean Henri Fabre. Fabre corrected the myth that a dung beetle would seek aid from other dung beetles when confronted by obstacles. By painstaking observations and experiments, he found the seeming helpers were, in fact, robbers awaiting an opportunity to steal the roller's food source.

Bombardier beetle

Bombardier beetles are ground beetles in the family Carabidae. There are more than 500 species which are notable for their defence mechanism. Most of them are found in rainforests.

When disturbed, the beetle squirts a poisonous chemical spray from special glands in its abdomen. The ejection makes a popping sound.

A bombardier beetle produces and stores (separately) two chemical compounds which react with each other: hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide. 

When threatened, the beetle contracts muscles that force the two reactants through tubes into a mixing chamber containing water and enzymes. The reactants undergo a violent chemical reaction which gives off heat. This raises the temperature to near the boiling point of water.
The beetle swivels the tip of its abdomen around, and shoots a spray of boiling hot, poisonous chemicals at its attacker.

<doc id="250741" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=250741" title="Glomerular filtration rate">
Glomerular filtration rate

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a test used by physicians and other medical professionals to see if the kidneys are working correctly. In basic terms, it is a measurement of how much liquid and waste is passing from the blood through the tiny filters in the kidney, called the glomeruli, and out into the urine during each minute. The test measures how much creatinine is in the blood. This shows how well the kidneys are performing. In a normal healthy person the GFR stays close to the same value all of the time. The test is done by taking blood from a person and sending it to a laboratory. Normal values are between 90ml/min and 110ml/min. A value below 60ml/minute means the person has chronic renal disease and a value below 15ml/minute means the person's kidneys have stopped working. 

Measurement of the GFR can be very helpful to medical professionals. It helps them decide if a person has a disease of the kidneys or not. A normal value for GFR is between 90-110ml/min. This will normally go down in older people. It will also go down in people with kidney disease. As well as helping a medical professional diagnose a kidney disease, the GFR is also used to monitor the progress of a disease.

The test begins by taking blood from a person's veins. The most common places are the vein in the elbow and the veins on the back of the hands. People usually feel a sharp stinging pain when the needle enters their skin. After the blood is drawn out, it is sent to a medical laboratory where a laboratory technician calculates the GFR. It is possible to calculate an exact value for the GFR but this is rarely done any more. Most of the time, the value is estimated (this is called an eGFR). The basis for this estimate is a chemical in the blood called creatinine. The calculation may also include things such as gender, age, height, weight, and race. Getting an exact measurement needs more tests and special equipment. Doctors now normally use the estimated GFR with signs, symptoms and the medical history given by the patient to come to a diagnosis. A final diagnosis of kidney disease may sometimes be made by a pathologist using tests such as a kidney biopsy. 

There are some slight risks when this test is done. These include, too much bleeding from the needle entering the skin and vein, blood collecting under the skin, feeling faint, and infection from the skin being pierced by the needle.

There are many functions that make up the GFR. These include: nitrogen based waste, sodium (salt), water, potassium, phosphate, and some medicines dissolved in the plasma such as digoxin and gentamicin. Blood pressure, the balance of acids to bases, the release of erythropoietin (a chemical that tells the body to make more red blood cells). The activation of vitamin D1, the formation of glucose in the fasting state, and the creation of peptide hormones (including insulin) all affect the GFR.

A GFR of less than 60ml/minute for three or more months indicates chronic kidney disease. A GFR of less than 15ml/minute indicates full failure of the kidneys. GFR estimates between 60 and 89 mL/minute do not mean a person has chronic kidney disease unless there are other signs of disease. People with either higher than normal amounts of muscle mass, such as bodybuilders or people with lower than normal amounts of muscle mass, such as amputees or people with muscle wasting disorders (when the muscles become less dense than normal) can have GFR test results that do not appear normal, but may still be normal. A medical professional will explain the meaning of any GFR test done on a patient.

<doc id="250774" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=250774" title="Fallout (video game)">
Fallout (video game)

Fallout is a role-playing game for the computer. This computer game was made by Interplay Entertainment. It was completed in 1997. It takes place 84 years after nuclear bombs have turned the Earth into a desert, and destroyed all the governments. 

The player controls the character by using the mouse to make the character go places. When the character gets there, the player can make the character do other things. Some things the character can do are fighting, stealing, and talking. When the player is done playing in one town or place, he or she can use a map to get to a new place. 

Because life is hard in the game, there are people who need help in every town. The player can choose to help the good guys or the bad guys (or both). Helping the good guys gives "karma points." Helping the bad guys costs karma points. A very evil character will have negative karma. No matter who the player helps, the character gets "experience points," which help the character get better at doing things. 

The world is full of danger. There are people who will try to kill the character and take his stuff, and there are dangerous mutant animals that will try to eat the character. When this happens, the player must fight. 

Combat in "Fallout" is like chess, because every character gets a turn. If the player attacks a character, then that character cannot act until the player is done with that attack. Then the character gets a turn to attack the player. This goes on, back and forth, until one of them dies or runs away. Some characters can do more actions per turn, depending on how long it takes to do the action, and how much agility the character has. More agile characters can do more actions per turn. 

The player and other characters in "Fallout" can attack with their fists, with hand-held weapons like sledgehammers, with thrown weapons like grenades and with guns. Guns can be as small as pistols, or as large as gatling guns. There are even energy weapons, such as lasers. 

In 2077, nuclear war erupted between the United States and China. Most of the people on Earth died, and the world became a desert. Fortunately, the United States government had already built underground fallout shelters called "Vaults," where some of the people went to survive. The player character was born in Vault 13, in what had been California. The people living in the vault were too scared to ever come out of the Vault, so they stayed inside it for 84 years. 

Then, the computer chip that makes their water safe to drink breaks down. The Vault does not have any extra "Water Chips," so they send the player character into the desert to find a new one. He or she has 150 days to do, or else the people in the Vault will die. 

Although the search for a new Water Chip is what starts the game, the player can do many other things while he or she is looking for the Chip, and even afterward. 

One interesting thing about "Fallout" is its "retrofuturistic" style. Retrofuturism means that, although the game is set in the future ("-futurism"), it looks like the past ("retro-"). Another way of explaining retrofuturism would be to say that the game shows the kind of future that people in the past would have imagined. 

Specifically, "Fallout" is the future as 1955 America might have seen it. This can be seen in the themes of the game -- fear of nuclear war and a need for fallout shelters for safety -- and in the artistic style, or "looks" of the game. For example, all computers in "Fallout" contain either vacuum tubes or magnetic tape reels. Of course no one at Interplay in 1997 thought that there would be vacuum tubes in the future, but they put them in the game for the sake of retrofuturism. 

Many famous actors voiced some of the characters in "Fallout". These include Richard Dean Anderson from "MacGyver", David Warner from "", Tony Shalhoub from "Monk", Brad Garrett from "Everybody Loves Raymond", Keith David from "There's Something About Mary", Richard Moll from "Night Court", and Tony Jay from "ReBoot". Also, Ron Perlman from "Hellboy" was the narrator in the opening credits. 

A lot of the people who worked on the game later joined Black Isle Studios, a smaller company inside Interplay that just made role-playing games. One of the games Black Isle Studios made was "Fallout 2". After Interplay shut Black Isle Studios down, many of those game-makers went on to start Obsidian Entertainment, the game company that made in 2010.

"Fallout" was very popular when it came out, and continues to be remembered as a great game. It was ranked #4 on "PC Gamer's" list of top games of all time in 2001. It was named #5 on the "IGN" list of the top 25 PC games of all time in 2007, and #19 in 2009. The year it came out it was awarded "RPG of the Year" by "GameSpot", and is now on their "Greatest Games of All Time" list. "Fallout" was ranked #55 on "IGN"'s 2005 top 100 games of all time, and #33 in 2007.

Brooklyn Museum

The Brooklyn Museum is the second-largest art museum in New York City. It is also one of the largest in the United States. 

The museum is at 200 Eastern Parkway, in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Arnold L. Lehman is the museum's Director.

The Brooklyn Museum has more than one-and-a-half million objects. Some of these pieces of art are from as long ago as ancient Egypt while others are very recent. The museum is a 560,000 square foot (52,000 m²), Beaux-Arts building. Approximately 500,000 people visit the museum each year.

The Brooklyn Museum was started by Augustus Graham in 1897. The building has a steel frame It was designed by McKim, Mead, and White and built by the Carlin Construction Company. Daniel Chester French, the man who made the Lincoln Memorial, made two allegorical figures, "Brooklyn" and "Manhattan" (carved in 1916, and moved to the museum in 1963), and of the figures on the building.

Thomas S. Buechner was made the museum's director in 1960. He was one of the youngest directors in the country.. Buechner made a large change in the way the museum displayed the art art. Also one thousand pieces of art that had been in the museum's archives were put back on display.

The Brooklyn Museum changed its name to Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1997. On March 12, 2004, the museum announced that it would revert to its old name, the Brooklyn Museum.

In 2005, the museum was one of 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to get part of $20 million from the Carnegie Corporation, made possible by a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The museum is known for its large collections of Egyptian and African art, and 17th, 18th, and 19th century paintings.

In 2002, the museum bought the work "The Dinner Party" by artist Judy Chicago. It has been in the museum's Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art since 2007.

In 2008, Edna Russman said that a third of the Coptic art in the museum's collection, the second-largest in North America, is fake. Of 30 works of art, Russman believes 10 are faked. The fake artworks have been displayed since 2009.

Artists like Patrick Kelly, Chuck Close, Denis Peterson, Ron Mueck, Takashi Murakami, Mat Benote, Kiki Smith, Jim Dine, Robert Rauschenberg, Sylvia Sleigh, William Wegman and Banksy have also been found in the museum..

In 2000, the Brooklyn Museum started the Student Museum Apprentice Program. The museum hires teens ages 13–17, to give tours in the museum during the summer, help with the museum's weekend family programs during the year, and help plan teen events.

The first Saturday of the month in the summer, the Brooklyn Museum stays open late with free family events, which include arts and crafts, live music and a dance party.

Wikipedia:A nice cup of tea and a sit down

A nice cup of tea and a sit down is a chance to say what you like about other people who edit Wikipedia or their changes. As Thumper's mother said: "If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all". That rather reasonable idea is the main rule on this page. The goal is to make goodwill and maybe help the processes that occurs on other pages – or, if we're lucky, stop or avoid disputes at all.

Of course, this page should not replace talking about people directly on their talk pages, or on article talk pages. "A nice cup of tea and a sit down" is for when things have gone far ahead that, and there is a need for some more formal and serious niceness.

If you get the urge to say something like "I think that such-and-such has worked really hard on Wikipedia, but...", you should stop there. The rule of thumb when making a compliment is to "stop at the but/however/although". Just giving compliments, please.

When you're done pouring, you may want to leave the template on their talk page, so they know that their tea is ready.

Stick insect

Stick insects are insects in the order Phasmatodea (or Phasmida).

The whole order is camouflaged as either sticks or leaves. Leaf insects are generally the family Phylliidae. They are found in South and southeast Asia to Australia. 

There are in excess of 3,000 described species, with many more yet to be described, in museum collections and in the wild. 

The order has a worldwide distribution, but most species are found in the tropics. These tropic species vary from stick like species to those resembling bark, leaves and even moss or lichen. The stick insect can sometimes reach over 13 inches (33 cm) long.

A few species, such as "Carausius morosus", are even able to change their pigmentation to match their surroundings. Many species are wingless, or have reduced wings.

Phasmids are herbivorous, feeding mostly on the leaves of trees and shrubs(e.g. privet). Their eggs are usually camouflaged, resembling plant seeds, and may remain dormant for a full season or more before hatching. The nymphs are born already closely resembling the adults.

Stick insects, like praying mantis, show rocking behaviour in which the insect makes rhythmic, repetitive side-to-side movements. This may help crypsis by resembling vegetation moving in the wind. 

Also, the swaying movements may help the insects see objects against the background. Rocking movements by these sedentary (sitting) insects may replace flying or running as way to define objects in the visual field.

Some species of phasmid are able to produce a defensive spray when threatened. The spray contains pungent-smelling volatile molecules which the insect gets from its food plant. The spray from one species, "Megacrania nigrosulfurea", is even used as a treatment for skin infections by a tribe in Papua New Guinea by virtue of its antibacterial constituents.

Many stick insects are easy to care for, and make good pets. Almost 300 species have been reared in captivity.

<doc id="250798" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=250798" title="Extra time">
Extra time

Extra time is an additional period of time added to a game if the score is tied at the end of normal time. Some sports do not allow some of all of their games to end in a tie. In score notation (notes about the score of the game), it is often written by the letters ET or a.e.t. a.e.t stands for "after extra time".

In tournament play, where only the winner advances to the next round, professional association football add 30 minutes of extra time to the game. The extra time is made up of two 15-minute periods. If a game is still tied after extra time it is usually decided by kicks from the penalty mark, commonly called a penalty shootout. 

Extra time is also used in other sports, including rugby union and rugby league, where it usually lasts for 20 minutes. In Australian rules football, two five-minute extra time periods are played in knockout finals matches when scores are tied at the end of the final quarter. In Gaelic football (and hurling), two halves of ten minutes are played after a draw. In major Gaelic football tournaments, extra time is only used if a replay finishes in a tie. In field hockey matches, extra time of 7½ minutes each way is played.

In North American sports, extra time is usually referred to as "overtime"; for ice hockey, it is usually "sudden death", which means that the overtime period ends with the first score made. In college football, a system of alternating possessions beginning at the opponent's 25-yard line is used which plays out similarly to extra innings in baseball in that each team receives a chance to score, and if the game is still tied, another iteration occurs.

Wikipedia:Emergency deflagging

Sometimes a may need to take the administrator right away from an administrator in an emergency. Also a may need to remove the bureaucrat and administrator rights from a bureaucrat in an emergency. This is only done as a temporary measure to protect the project from serious danger. The community can then decide whether the rights can be given back. 

An administrator or bureaucrat should lose their flag when they are badly harming the project. For example, if an administrator makes actions using the tools that make no sense, such as deleting the main page or making blocks that are senseless. Emergency deflagging is for actions against policy.

When a flag is removed it does not have to be removed forever. Any bureaucrat may give back the rights when there is proof that the emergency is over. 

The permanent removal of flags must be decided by the community. If the deflagging happened because the admin or bureaucrat broke the rules, then a formal RFDA/RFDB (Request for de-adminship or de-bureaucratship) should be done. Otherwise, it is not needed as long as the emergency has passed and it does not look like it will happen again.

David Pall

David Boris Pall (2 April 1914 - 21 September 2004), founder of Pall Corporation, was the chemist who invented the Pall filter used in blood transfusions.

Born in Thunder Bay, Ontario of Russian immigrant parents, he grew up on a farm in Saskatchewan, and attended McGill University, from which he was granted a bachelor's degree in chemistry and a Ph.D. in physical chemistry. He moved to New York in 1938 and became a part of the Manhattan Project. In 1946, he established Pall Corporation. The company's initial focus was on the development of filters for use in aircraft hydraulics. 

However, in 1959, when Dr. Pall's first wife, Josephine, died of aplastic anemia, he began to work on the Pall filter. Mrs. Pall had undergone multiple blood transfusions in the course of an illness, which were ultimately unsuccessful. The Pall filter makes blood transfusions significantly safer by filtering out white blood cells, thereby reducing the incidence of transfusion reactions and viral infections. Today, Pall Corporation has sales in excess of $2.0 Billion.

In his lifetime, Dr. Pall received over 180 patents and in 1990, he received the United States National Medal of Technology from President George H.W. Bush.

Pall, a trustee of the North Shore University Hospital, died of complications of Alzheimer's disease at his last home in Roslyn Estates, New York.

Meresankh I was Ancient Egyptian queen of the 3rd dynasty of Egypt. She was a lesser ranked wife of Pharaoh Huni, mother of Pharaoh Sneferu, grandmother of Pharaoh Khufu. One of her great-granddaughters was named Meresankh II. 

Name of Meresankh appears on a fragment of the Palermo Stone. She is also mentioned at Meidum. 

Title of Meresankh was "King's Wife". 

Queens' name means "She Loves Life". Here is a name of this queen written in hieroglyphs:

Huni

Huni was the last Pharaoh of Egyptian Third dynasty. He was successor of Khaba, and maybe Khaba's son. Huni established a fortress on the island of Elephantine, and he maybe built pyramid in Meidum.

One of officials of king Djoser was also named Huni, and it's possible that this man and pharaoh Huni are the same person. 

Huni had two wives - Djefatnebti and Meresankh I. With Djefatnebti, he fathered Hetepheres I, and with Meresankh he sired Sneferu, his own successor. Sneferu became a king after Huni's death, and he married his half-sister Hetepheres. Huni's grandson - son of Sneferu - was pharaoh Khufu, who built Great Pyramid of Giza.

<doc id="251010" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=251010" title="Peace treaty">
Peace treaty

A peace treaty is a formal (official) agreement which ends a conflict. The conflict is usually between countries or governments, but may be between any other kind of group. The conflict is usually armed conflict, such as war, or serious disputes which might lead to war.

A peace treaty is different from an armistice, which is an agreement to cease hostilities, or a surrender, in which one side agrees to give up its arms.

Peace treaties are made in stages:

Peace treaties may include various items:

The earliest recorded peace treaty was between the Hittite and Egyptian empires. The Battle of Kadesh (about 1274 BC) took place in what is modern Syria. The entire Levant was at that time contested between the Egyptian and Hittite empires. After a costly four-day battle, in which neither side gained a clear advantage, both sides claimed victory. 

Fear of further conflict between the two states persuaded both rulers, Hattusili III and Ramesses II, to end their dispute and sign a peace treaty. Both sides were threatened by other enemies. Egypt had to defend her western border against Libyan tribesmen, while the Hittites faced the threat of the Assyrian Empire, which had conquered Mesopotamia. 

The peace treaty was recorded in two versions. One was in Egyptian hieroglyphics, the other in Akkadian, using cuneiform script. Fortunately, both versions survive. Such dual-language recording is common to many treaties. This treaty differs from others in that the two language versions are differently worded. Most of the text is identical, but the Hittite version claims that the Egyptians came suing for peace, while the Egyptian version claims the reverse. 

The treaty was made in year 21 of Ramesses' reign, probably 1258 BC. It contains a mutual-assistance pact in case one of the empires should be attacked by a third party, or in the event of internal strife. There are articles on the forced repatriation (sending back) of refugees, and provisions that they should not be harmed. So this might be called the first extradition treaty. There are also threats of retribution, should the treaty be broken.

This treaty is so significant that a reproduction hangs in the United Nations headquarters.

Khaba was a Pharaoh of the 3rd dynasty of Ancient Egypt. His predecessor was Sekhemkhet, and his successor was Huni. Khaba's reign is dated from 2640 BC to 2637 BC. 

We do not know who Khaba's parents were, but it is most likely that he was a son of Sekhemkhet and his wife Djeseretnebti. It is possible that Khaba was a father of Huni and grandfather of Sneferu. 

Khaba's name means "the soul appears".

<doc id="251015" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=251015" title="Monoamine oxidase inhibitor">
Monoamine oxidase inhibitor

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (RIMAs) are a type of antidepressant drugs given for the treatment of depression. They are good at treating atypical depression, Parkinson's disease, anxiety disorders, social phobia and have also shown to help people to stop smoking tobacco.

As MAOIs drugs can be fatal people if they take too much, they are often only ever given when other antidepressant drugs have failed. Some newer drugs such as selegiline and moclobemide have proven to be safer than the older MAOIs and are prescribed by physicians in the first instance. 

MAOIs and RIMAs are used to provide a second line of treatment for certain psychiatric illnesses, most commonly types of hard to treat depression with not normal symptoms and anxiety disorders (with or without panic attacks. They may also be used for social phobia. MAO-B inhibitors are used to treat Parkinson's disease. Certain MAOIs have been shown to help people to stop smoking tobacco. 

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors work by stopping the action of an enzyme called monoamine oxidase. This enzyme breaks down a group of brain signalling chemicals called the monoamine neurotransmitters. There are two types of the enzyme, MAO-A and MAO-B. Each type breaks apart different chemicals in the group. MAO-A breaks down melatonin, serotonin, epinephrine and norepinephrine. MAO-B breaks down phenylethylamine and the trace amines. These chemicals (neurotransmitters) are used in the brain for signalling purposes. Dopamine, for example, is a chemical that affects motivation and pleasure. Effectively, they work on balancing the brain's chemistry. 

Like all drugs, MAOIs and RIMAs can have effects that are not intended and are not part of the treatment that the drugs provide. In this class of drug, these include a risk of a hypertensive crisis. This can be caused by high levels of tyramine; such as by eating cheese (except cream or cottage cheese, meat extracts such as Bovril, yeast extract, stock cubes, fermented soya bean products, alcohol (especially fortified wine (port, sherry), beer and chainti wine. Also preserved fish, preserved poultry, offal, avocado, banana skins, broad bean pods and pickled or smoked herring must be avoided. Certain medications can also cause a hypertensive crisis with MAOIs and RIMAs, such as; amphetamine, fenfluramine, ephedrine, phenlyephrine, phenylpropanolamine, nasal decongestants, L-dopa, pethidine and tricyclic antidepressants. Use of a RIMA rather than a MAOI can reduce these side-effects, however tyramine rich foods should still be avoided.

Isoform

A protein isoform is any of several different forms of the same protein. Different forms of a protein may be produced from related genes, or may be made from the same gene by alternative splicing. A large number of isoforms are caused by single-nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs, small genetic differences between alleles of the same gene. These occur at specific individual nucleotide (building block of dna-strand) positions within a gene.

Google Wave is an internet application made by Google. Google describes Wave as an application which "lets you communicate and collaborate in real time". This means that Wave can be used for several people to edit a document at the same time, or for a group discussion. Waves can be used in a similar way to a forum, or just for emails and instant messaging between two or more people.

To use Google Wave in some browsers like Internet Explorer, you have to install Google Chrome Frame. This makes Internet explorer behave like Google Chrome on the Wave website. This is needed because Internet Explorer does not have enough features for Wave to work: it does not have full HTML5 support.

To use Wave you must have a Google account.

It is in a very mountainous place. Because of that, it had been separated for a long time from the rest of the country. This made its culture and language very different from other areas.

Wenzhou was a prosperous foreign treaty port, which remains well-preserved today. It is situated in a very mountainous region and, as a result, has been isolated for most of its history from the rest of the country, making the local culture and language very different from those of neighbouring areas. Many of its people move to other countries like Europe and America. It is also famous for its oranges and bamboo.

Lesothosaurus was a small, early, lightly-built dinosaur. It was an herbivore (plant-eater) and a fast, agile runner. It was small and lizard-like, about 3 feet (1 m) long. It walked on two long legs, had four-toed feet, five-fingered hands, short arms, a long pointed tail, a flexible neck, and a small head. Its head was short and flat with large eyes. It had sharp, pointed front teeth and arrow-like cheek teeth, but its lower jaw ended in toothless bone. 

The place of this species within the Ornithischia is controversial. It is probably an ornithopod.

Template:FIFAgroup/doc

Note: because this template calls other templates, the above display looks out of alignment. Look at the Example template to see what the actual will look like.

FIFAgroup = FIFA Group stage (Round 1) results table

This template has been designed to construct the group tables for the first round of FIFA play, and to simplify the data entry of the results from each game.

The format of the template input parameters has been designed to look the same as the output group table.

This template must be setup with the initial FIFA groupings. Each county has a three-letter code used by FIFA. This template calls the Fb template to display the country flag. If the flag is missing, something will happen. The missing flag must be correct before this template may be used.

Fb calls the Country data template for each country. If the template is missing, a red-link Template:Country data XXX, where XXX is the country code, will be displayed. The missing Country data template must be created before this template may be used.

To use the template, start by copying the following blank template. Please note that spacing and formatting is an important to the ease of use of the template. All of the input parameters will not line up at this point. After the initial data has been entered, the template will be aligned

If the group name table caption is desired, add the group letter in the first parameter field (indicated by the red "G"). The letter does not need to be centered in the input parameter. If the field is left blank, no table caption will be displayed. Be sure to add a space in the field to keep the input table format.

Add the three-letter country codes for the four countries in this group. These codes must be placed in the next four parameter fields (indicated by blue "C-a" through "C-d") on the first line of parameters. Also, add the same country codes in the first parameter field of each of the following four lines of parameters ((indicated by green "C-a" through "C-d").

After adding the group and country codes, the basic template input should look like the following example. The countries South Africa (RSA), Mexico (MEX), USA (USA), and France (FRA) have been used as an example


At this point, the template output will look like the following:
 <nowiki></nowiki>

Scores and game statistics are entered into the template input parameters in the same format they will be displayed in the output table.

For example, if the first game played is Mexico vs. France, and France wins the match 3 goals to 1, the following entries (highlighted in red) would be entered.

The resulting output will look like this:

After each match results are entered the countries must be reordered to match the current rankings. The first line of input parameters, with the group code and column headers must not be changed. The following four lines of input parameters may be rearranged. 

It is important that the entire line of parameters for a country be moved together as one group. In this example, France is ranked number 1, Mexico number 2. South Africa and the USA will remain 3 and 4 for the time being.

will result in the following output.

As additional matches are played, the data should be added to the table. Be sure to correctly compute Goals For (GF), Goals Against (GA), Goals Difference (GD), and Points (Pts).

When countries advance to the next round, enter the letter a in the Note column. When countries are eliminated, enter the letter e in the Note column. This will output the message Advances to Round 2 or Eliminated under the Note in the output table. It will also highlight the country row blue or pink. For example:

<includeonly>

</includeonly>

will result in the following output.

The first row of parameters looks like the output table header. The only user parameters are the first five.
The next four rows of parameters looks like the match results. The input for each row is identical. The first five fields will be referred to by number. The remaining fields will be referred to by the name of header code above the field column.

Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden, also known as Sophia Karlovna Buxhoeveden (Russian: София Карловна Буксгевден, September 6, 1883 – November 26, 1956), was a lady in waiting to Tsarina Alexandra of Russia. She wrote three memoirs about the imperial family and about her own escape from Russia. In her book "Before the Storm", Sophie describes a side of old Russia seldom seen elsewhere, a family in the old fashioned provincial country life of the gentry in the years before the revolution. When she saw the famous imposter, Anna Anderson, who was at first claiming to be Grand Duchess Tatiana, she did not believe her. She called her "too short" to be Tatiana. When Anderson later claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, the Baroness said that Anderson "does not physically resemble her in the least".

<doc id="251321" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=251321" title="Tori Amos">
Tori Amos

Tori Amos is an American singer and songwriter who has won many awards for her music. She was born on August 22, 1963 in Newton, North Carolina. Her name by birth is Myra Ellen Amos. Her father, Edison Amos, is a Methodist minister. Her mother, Mary Ellen Amos, is part Cherokee Indian. Her grandfather, Calvin Clinton Copeland, was very important to her as a child. The things he taught her continue to be important to her as an adult.

Tori Amos was an unusually talented child. She was able to play piano at the age of two and a half years. When she was two, her family moved to Baltimore, Maryland. When she was five years old, she was already writing her own songs on the piano. At age five she won a scholarship to a very important music school called the Peabody Conservatory of Music. Tori enjoyed writing her own music and making songs up as she went along, but did not enjoy playing music that was written by other people as much. Because of this they took her scholarship away at the age of eleven.

When Tori was 14, she began singing and playing piano at bars. Her father came with her to make sure she was safe. She won a singing contest by singing a song she wrote called "More Than Just a Friend". When she was 18, Tori recorded her first song. It was called "Baltimore." The song was entered into a contest being held by the Baltimore Orioles, a baseball team. Tori won the contest. The song was released on a 7" vinyl record, and the song on the other side was called "Walking With You". This record was Tori's very first music release, and 500 copies were made. Today it is considered a very valuable item, and costs a lot of money.

When Tori was 21, she changed her name from Myra Ellen to Tori. She moved to Los Angeles, California to try and become a professional singer and musician. She put together a rock and roll band which was called Y Kant Tori Read. The name of the band was a joke about when she went to piano school and did not want to read printed music, instead making up her own music. The band included a guitarist named Steve Caton, a drummer named Matt Sorum, a bass guitar player named Brad Cobb and a keyboard player named Jim Tauber. The band was signed to a recording contract with Atlantic Records. In 1988 they released their first and only album, also called "Y Kant Tori Read". It was released on 12" vinyl record, cassette tape and CD. The album's style was rock and roll, and is a very different type of music from what Tori would become famous for later in her life.

The album did not sell many copies. It was considered a very big failure. The band broke up. Matt Sorum ended up becoming famous in the band Guns N' Roses. Brad Cobb became a successful musician also, playing in many different bands. Steve Caton later went on to perform with Tori on other projects until the year 1999.

Tori was very disappointed with the failure of her album. She had to continue recording more albums, because she signed an agreement with Atlantic Records that said she had to record up to six albums if they asked her to. Tori put together an album by herself, but when she played the music for the people at the record label, they did not like it. She spent more time on the music, changing the songs. She took away some songs, and added some new songs. This time the record label people liked the record.

In 1991 Tori released "Little Earthquakes", her second album (after "Y Kant Tori Read".) The album became a big success. The lyrics on the album were about very personal experience and feelings Tori had. They were about topics like religion, sex and growing up. One song, called "Me and a Gun," was very personal because it was about a time when Tori was raped.

In 1993 Tori released "Under the Pink", her third album. This album was even more successful than the last. The lyrics continued on topics from "Little Earthquakes", including a song called "Icicle" which was about childhood masturbation.

In 1996 Tori released "Boys For Pele", her fourth album. This album was very different from her other albums. It was much longer, having 18 songs. The music was more complicated, including a lot of different styles of music and types of instruments. Reviewers had different opinions about the album. Many reviews said the lyrics were hard to make sense of, and that the music was not easy to listen to. Other reviews said the songs were very interesting and unique. Despite the mixed opinions, "Boys For Pele" was Tori's most successful album to this day. It was successful world-wide.

In 1998 Tori released "From the Choirgirl Hotel", her fifth album. This album was also very different from her previous albums. Instead of focusing mostly on piano and many different instruments like orchestras, this album included a style of music called "electronica". This type of music often uses computers to create musical sounds and rhythms. Tori also included a full band on most of the songs, including guitar, drums and bass guitar. This was the first time she had done so since her album "Y Kant Tori Read". The lyrics of the album continued to be very personal. Some topics included Tori's own miscarriages of several babies, and marriage. Most of the reviews of this album were very positive, and in the first week the album sold more copies than any of Tori's other albums did in their first week. However, the album's total sales were not as high as any of her previous ones.

In 1999 Tori released her sixth album, "To Venus and Back". This was a double album. Oftentimes a double album simply means that there are two discs, cassettes or records included and many more tracks than a normal album. In the case of "To Venus and Back", it was actually two separate albums packaged together under one theme. The first album in the set was called "Orbiting", and was a full new album of 11 recorded songs. The second album in the set was called "Live: Still Orbiting", and was a collection of live songs recorded at Tori's performances across the world. "Orbiting" continued the electronica theme of "From the Choirgirl Hotel", with lyrics about things like growing up, losing her babies in her miscarriages and homosexuality. The album received most positive reviews. A single from the album called "Bliss" was the very first song in history from a major record label to be sold on the internet as a digital song.

At this point in her career, Tori felt that her record label was not doing enough things to promote her music and albums. She had only one album left to record and release for them according to their agreement. In 2001 she released her seventh album "Strange Little Girls". This album featured songs that other singers and bands had written and recorded, but sung by Tori with a new idea behind what they mean. Part of the reason Tori did this was because she did not want to give her own songs, which mean very much to her, to the record label if they were not going to properly promote them. The album featured Tori's versions of songs by performers like Neil Young, the band Slayer and the rapper Eminem. The album was a "concept album," which means that all of the songs fit into one big idea. Tori's idea was to take songs that had been sung by men and sing them from a woman's point of view. The album received both good and bad reviews, but it did not sell nearly as many copies as her other albums.

In late 2001 Tori changed to the record label Epic. In 2002 she released her eighth album, called "Scarlet's Walk". This album was another concept album. In this concept, Tori created a story about a woman named Scarlet. Scarlet took a journey across America after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 that happened in New York City. Along the way Scarlet meets a lot of different characters, mostly men. She has romances, friendships and gets involved in many situations. Each song is about one of the people she meets or one of the things that happens to her. The album was more successful than "Strange Little Girls", but did not meet the success of her other albums. However, the single "A Sorta Fairytale" was her most successful American radio single. The music video for this song featured Oscar winning actor Adrien Brody.

In 2003 Tori released a greatest hits album called "Tales of a Librarian". The album was the final part of her agreement with Atlantic Records. She took many of her older songs and changed them in a recording studio, giving them new sounds. She also included two brand new songs.

In 2003, Tori's new label Epic joined together with another label called BMG. Tori has said in interviews that this was not what she wanted to happen, and that the new people in charge were more interested in making money than in making good music. This year she also had a part in a movie called "Mona Lisa Smile". Tori played a singer at a wedding reception. 

In 2005, Tori released her ninth album, "The Beekeeper". This album had a more traditional pop and rock musical style. Some described it as adult contemporary music. The album was unusually long, with 19 songs on a regular edition and 20 songs on a special edition. The lyrics were about personal things in Tori's life. Many of them were about sickness and death. This is because in the year she recorded it, her mother nearly died of a heart attack, and then her older brother died in a car accident. Compared to her other albums, the album did not sell very well. The reviews of the album were both good and bad. Many said the album was too long.

Later in 2005, Tori released a series of albums which were called "The Original Bootlegs". There were six albums in total, each with two CDs. Each album was of a full length live concert performed for her "The Beekeeper" tour. The albums were at first sold separately, and later put together in a boxed set. That year she also released a biography called "Piece by Piece". It was a best seller.

In 2006, Tori released a DVD called "Fade to Red". It was a compilation of all of Tori's music videos. That same year she also released a very complex boxed set of music called "A Piano". This set had five CDs and compiled tracks spanning all the way back to the album "Little Earthquakes". The package for the set was shaped like a piano keyboard. 

In 2007, Tori released her tenth album, "American Doll Posse". This was another concept album. This time Tori created several characters, but instead of just writing stories about them, she dressed up like them and created personalities for them. Tori would wear costumes and wigs for the characters during her concert performances. Each song on the album was supposed to be sung by one of the characters. The themes and music style of this album was very much like "The Beekeeper". The album was even longer, with 23 tracks on the regular version and 26 on the special edition. It sold around the same number of copies as the previous album, and reviews were similar as well. Again, many said the album was too long.

Later in 2007, Tori released a series of albums which were called "Legs & Boots". There were 27 full double-albums released. Each one was the content from a live show during her tour for the album "American Doll Posse". They albums were only available digitally; there were no CD versions.

In 2008, Amos made an agreement with her record label Epic, and left the label. She released a live concert DVD called "Live in Montreaux 1991/1992". She then signed a contract with a new record label, Universal Republic.

In 2009, Tori released her eleventh album, "Abnormally Attracted to Sin". Though the album got almost all good reviews, it did not sell any better than her more recent albums. Later that year she released an album called "Midwinter Graces". The album was like a holiday or Christmas album, but Tori called it a "seasonal album." It contained both traditional carols and original songs by Tori. Tori Amos sings in the mezzo-soprano range.

<doc id="251414" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=251414" title="Blood and soil">
Blood and soil

Blood and soil is an idea that started in the 19th century. It looks at a person's blood, to see where they come from, and who their ancestors were. It also looks at the soil a person is working on, to make a claim that they should indeed work and occupy that land. In the nineteenth century, the idea was linked to racism and to nationalism. 
One of the first to use "Blut und Boden", or "blood and soil" was Oswald Spengler in his book "Der Untergang des Abendlandes". In the book, Spengler talks about the "struggle of blood and soil about the inner form of a relocated species of animal and man". Walther Darré took the phrase and established the link. In his book "Neuadel aus Blut und Boden" (New nobility from blood and soil) he tries to show the relation between economic and agrarian policies, as well as racial ones.

Another idea of the blood and soil ideology comes from Lamarckism: The ethnic characteristics of a population are linked to the geographical regions it inhabits; only in this region will it be able to fully live up to its potential.

There is also a literary genre called "blood and soil". In it, it shows an agrarian society living up to this ideals. People writing in this style were Gerhard Schumann and Herbert Böhme.

The ideas are also sometimes shown in artworks. Artists included Adolf Ziegler, Arthur Kampf, Arno Breker and Josef Thorak. Very often, such artworks were seen as degenerate art when the Nazi party came to power. Artists had to flee, many died in exile.

Sifaka

Sifakas are a lemur in Madagascar. They cannot run on all four of their legs because they are much longer than their arms. Instead, they bounce along the forest floor, jumping from one foot to the other, holding their arms up in the air.

Hornbill

The Hornbill is a bird that is found naturally in Africa. The female hornbill lays her eggs in a hole in a tree. Then, helped by her mate, she seals herself in, covering the entrance with droppings and mud. Only a small slit is left, through which the male gives her food. This keeps the nest safe from snakes until the chicks are grown enough to leave the nest, and learn how to fly.

Tailor ant

Tailor ants are ants that make their nests from living leaves, still attatched to the tree. Instead of needles and thread, they use a rare type of silk, made in the mouths of their own grubs. The grubs are passed to and from between the leaves, to sew them together. Tailor ants may be found in the rainforest of Asia.

Hattusili III was a king of the Hittite empire around 1267–1237 BC. He was the fourth and last son of Mursili II. 

Hattusili led the Hittite forces in the Battle of Kadesh against Egypt in 1274 BC. Hattusili and the Egyptian pharaoh Ramesses II later made a peace treaty. This is the earliest treaty which has survived to the present day. Apparently, it was based upon previous Hittite models. The treaty set up a long-lasting peace between the two rival empires. Ramesses married Hattusili's daughter, and years later he married another Hittite princess.

Marc Ferrez

Marc Ferrez (December 7, 1843 – January 12, 1923) was a Brazilian photographer born in Rio de Janeiro.

Ferrez's life was dedicated to the art of photography and he is considered one of the greatest photographers of his time. His production was massive, and his photographs document the consolidation of Brazil as a nation and Rio de Janeiro as a metropolis. His career was energized when he made part of Professor Charles Hartt's Geological Commission which covered the north and south of the country.

In 1865, Ferrez opened his own studio at Rua São José, in the center of Rio de Janeiro. He was made "Photographo da Marinha Imperial" and his work with images increased through his life. He photographed Brazil from south to north, but paid more attention to his home city, Rio de Janeiro. His masterpieces are the great albums of railway constructions and the great panoramic views of the city of Rio de Janeiro and its quick development.

Ferrez died in 1923 and left thousands of pictures and reproductions of his works.

Goo Ha-ra

Goo Ha-ra (Hangul: 구하라) was born on January 18, 1991. She is a South Korean singer, known for being a member of girl group Kara formed by DSP Entertainment in 2007. 

Goo Ha-ra was born on January 18, 1991, in Gwangju, South Korea. Before debuting, she participated in the SM's youth appearance tournament in 2005. In 2007, she auditioned for JYP, however, she lost the runoff.

She was also an online shopping mall model, having been scouted after her photos were uploaded onto DSP's homepage. Thus, Goo Hara became a member of Kara. Currently, she postponed going to university in order to concentrate on her career.

Kara debuted on March 29, 2007. In 2008, however, a member, Kim Sunghee, left the group. DSP Entertainment replaced her with two new members, Goo Hara and Kang Jiyoung, and Kara made a comeback with Rock U, which changed their image from "Hip-hop" to "cute and playful". 

In December 4, 2008, Kara started their comeback on M! Countdown with "Pretty Girl". In February 2009, Kara released their second mini-album "Honey". "Honey" became the group's first #1 single when it topped the "M! Countdown" and The Music Trend. 

In late July 2009, Kara revealed their second album named "Revolution". Due to the popularity of their songs Wanna and Mister, Kara's overall popularity increased. Kara recently started promotions with their third mini-album "Lupin".

In late 2008, she appeared along with the other Kara members in an episode of MBC sitcom "That Person is Coming", having the most prominent role as a female gang leader.

She joined MBC's "Hunters", along with SS501's Kim Hyun Joong, Jung Yong Hwa, Lee Hwi Jae, Shin Jung Hwan and two professional hunters to catch overpopulated wild boars that have become a dangerous threat to people and crops. The first episode aired on December 6, 2009. However, due to complaints about animal rights after the first episode, the show's format was quickly changed to "Eco House"; Goo Hara does not appear in the new show. 

In October 2009, she became a cast member in KBS 2TV reality show Invincible Youth ("청춘불패").

Avimimus (meaning "bird mimic") was a recently-discovered maniraptoran. It was a very fast moving, light-weight, bird-like theropod dinosaur that lived in the late Cretaceous in what is now Mongolia, around 70 million years ago. that may have had feathers.

The forelimbs were relatively short. The bones of the hand were fused together, as in modern birds, and a ridge on the ulna (lower arm bone) was interpreted as an attachment point for feathers by Kurzanov. Kurzanov, in 1987, also reported the presence of quill knobs, and while Chiappe confirmed the presence of bumps on the ulna, their function remained unclear. Kurzanov was so convinced they were attachment points for feathers that he concluded that "Avimimus" may have been capable of weak flight. The presence of feathers is now widely accepted, but most paleontologists do not believe "Avimimus" could fly.

Karnak

Karnak is the largest ancient religious site in the world. The complex of temples is near Luxor on the Nile in Egypt. Luxor is some 500 km south of Cairo. Approximately thirty pharaohs contributed to the buildings. The site reached a size, complexity, and diversity not seen elsewhere. 

The Karnak Temple Complex—usually called Karnak—comprises a vast group of ruined temples, chapels, pylons, and other buildings. The largest and most important are the Great Temple of Amun, and a massive structure begun by Pharaoh Ramses II (ca. 1391–1351 BC). 

An ancient sacred lake is part of the site as well. The area around Karnak was the ancient Egyptian Ipet-isut ('The Most Selected of Places'). It was the main place of worship of the eighteenth dynasty, part of the monumental city of Thebes. 

This is the largest precinct of the temple complex, dedicated to Amun-Re (a form of Amun), the chief deity. There are several colossal statues including the figure of Pinedjem I which is 10.5 meters tall. The sandstone for this temple, including all the columns, was transported from Gebel Silsila 100 miles south on the Nile river. It also has one of the largest obelisks weighing 328 tonnes and standing 29 meters tall.

The Great Hypostyle Hall of Karnak, within the Karnak temple complex, in the Precinct of Amon-Re, is one of the most visited monuments of Ancient Egypt.

The hall covers an area of 50,000 sq ft (5,000 m2). The roof, now fallen, was supported by 134 columns in 16 rows; the 2 middle rows are higher than the others (being 33 feet (10 m) in circumference and 80 feet (24 m) high).

The hall was not begun by Horemheb, or Amenhotep III as earlier scholars had thought. It was built entirely by Seti I who covered the northern wing of the hall with inscriptions. Decoration of the southern wing was completed by Ramesses II. Ramesses changed Seti's names to his own along the main east-west axis of the Hall and part of the north-south processional route. 

The precinct of Amun-Re is the only part of Karnak which is open to the public. There are also three smaller precicnts, which are not open:

<doc id="251702" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=251702" title="Constitution of the United Kingdom">
Constitution of the United Kingdom

The Constitution of the United Kingdom is a set of laws and rules in the United Kingdom that governs how the country is organized and the basic rights and freedoms of the people.

The UK's constitution is not written in one single document like many other countries' are. In fact, the UK's constitution is not completely written down at all. Some of it can be found in writing, starting with the Magna Carta of 1215 and the Bill of Rights Act 1689 and including more modern Acts of Parliament. Other parts of it are considered common law and are made up of the decisions of judges over many hundreds of years in a system called legal or judicial precedence. Because of this, some people say that the United Kingdom has a "de facto" or "unwritten" constitution.

Using the word "unwritten" is a problem, because most British laws and rules are written as statutes, or court judgments, the law of equity and in various treaties. Most of these laws come from the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Because most of the constitution is written down in this way, it is not technically correct to call it "unwritten" or ""de facto"". However, these words are still used. The Constitution of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is even more different to most other constitutions in that it is just a normal set of laws, and not a "higher" law that the government cannot easily change. The constitution has no more authority than any other law in the UK, and the government can change it just by passing a new Act. 

The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy. This means it has a Queen or a King. The Queen or King is decided by whether or not their parents, or other close relative, were King or Queen. Oldest brothers used to get to be King first, then the next brother, and so on, turning only to daughters when there were no sons. Queen Elizabeth II changed this, however, and rewrote the law so that the eldest child would become the next monarch no matter what its gender was.

German philosophy

German philosophy refers to philosophy written in German or by German philosophers. It started in the 17th century during the Age of Enlightenment, from Leibniz and Wolff through Kant, Schelling, Fichte, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Marx, Engels, and into the times of Nietzsche and Wittgenstein.

The philosophy that dominated this century was the school of German philosopher and mathematican Gottfred Leibniz, later expanded by his follower, Christian Wolff. Leibniz thought that knowledge comes from reason alone.

On the wake of the Enlightenment, a new philosophy called "critical philosophy" developed in Germany. It combined the ideals of philosophers Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778) of France and Switzerland and David Hume (1711-1776) of Scotland, and rationalism and empiricism. The founder of this school was Immanuel Kant. He published three "critiques", the most revolutionary being "Critique of Pure Reason" (1781), the other two being, "Critique of Practical Reason" and "Critique of Judgement". Two followers of Kant, Schelling and Fichte, thought that Kant's system had some errors and sought to improve it. A third philosopher, Hegel (1770-1831), developed his own kind of German idealism. His books are often difficult to read, and his ideas influenced many people, including those who agreed with him, and those who did not.

Library of Alexandria

The ancient Library of Alexandria was a large and significant library of the ancient world. It was founded in Alexandria, Egypt. The Library flourished under the patronage of the Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship. It was built in the third century BC.

In ancient Latin, the library was known as the ("see image at right"). The Greek term "bibliotheke" ("βιβλιοθήκη"), used by many historians of the era, refers to the collection of books, not to any building. This complicates the history and chronology. 

The library was conceived and opened either during the reign of Ptolemy I Soter or during the reign of his son Ptolemy II. 

Plutarch (AD 46–120) wrote that during his visit to Alexandria in 48 BC, Julius Caesar might have accidentally burned the library when he set fire to his own ships to frustrate Achillas' attempt to limit his ability to communicate by sea. According to Plutarch's account, this fire spread to the docks and then to the library.

However, this version of events is not confirmed in contemporary accounts of Caesar's visit. In fact, it has been reasonably established that segments of its collection were partially destroyed on several occasions before and after the first century BC. A modern view attributes the destruction to Coptic Christian Archbishop Theophilus of Alexandria in 391, who called for the destruction of the Serapeum -- the Daughter library and a temple to the god Serapis.

According to the earliest source of information, the library was initially organized by Demetrius of Phaleron, a student of Aristotle, under the reign of Ptolemy I Soter (ca.367 BC—ca.283 BC).

The library comprised a "peripatos" (walk), gardens, a room for shared dining, a reading room, lecture halls and meeting rooms. However, the exact layout is not known. This model's influence may still be seen today in the layout of university campuses. The library itself is known to have had an acquisitions department (possibly built near the stacks, or for utility closer to the harbour), and a cataloguing department. The hall contained shelves for the collections of scrolls (as the books were at this time on papyrus scrolls), known as "bibliothekai" ("βιβλιοθῆκαι"). It was rumored that carved into the wall above the shelves, a famous inscription read: "The place of the cure of the soul."

It was the first known library to gather a serious collection of books from beyond its country's borders. The Library was charged with collecting all the world's knowledge. It did so through an aggressive and well-funded royal mandate involving trips to the book fairs of Rhodes and Athens and a policy of pulling the books off every ship that came into port. They kept the original texts and made copies to send back to their owners. Alexandria, because of its man-made bidirectional port between the mainland and the Pharos island, welcomed trade from the East and West, and soon found itself the international hub for trade, as well as the leading producer of papyrus and, soon enough, books.

The library was also home to a host of international scholars. The library filled its stacks with new works in mathematics, astronomy, physics, natural history and other subjects. It was at the Library of Alexandria that the scientific method was first conceived and put into practice, and its empirical standards applied in serious textual criticism. As the same text often existed in several different versions, comparative textual criticism was crucial for ensuring their accuracy. Once ascertained, copies would then be made for scholars, royalty and wealthy bibliophiles the world over, this commerce bringing income to the library. The editors at the Library of Alexandria are especially well known for their work on Homeric texts. The more famous editors generally also held the title of head librarian. These included, among others,

Already famous in the ancient world, the library's collection became even more storied in later years. Papyrus scrolls comprised the collection, and although parchment codices were used predominantly as a more advanced writing material after 300 BC.

A single piece of writing might occupy several scrolls. King Ptolemy II Philadelphus (309–246 BC) is said to have set 500,000 scrolls as an objective for the library. Mark Antony supposedly gave Cleopatra over 200,000 scrolls (taken from the great Library of Pergamum) for the library as a wedding gift. Carl Sagan, in his series , states that the library contained nearly one million scrolls, though other experts have estimated a smaller number. No index of the library survives, and it is not possible to know with certainty how large and how diverse the collection may have been. 

A perhaps exaggerated story concerns how the library's collection grew so large. By decree of Ptolemy III of Egypt, all visitors to the city were required to surrender all books and scrolls. Official scribes then swiftly copied these writings, some copies proving so precise that the originals were put into the library, and the copies delivered to the unsuspecting owners. This process also helped to create a reservoir of books in the relatively new city.

According to Galen, Ptolemy III requested permission from the Athenians to borrow the original scripts of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, for which the Athenians demanded the enormous amount of fifteen talents as guarantee. Ptolemy happily paid the fee but kept the original scripts for the library.

The Bibliotheca Alexandrina was inaugurated in 2002 near the site of the old library.

International Auxiliary Language Association

The International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) was founded in 1924 to promote widespread study, discussion and publicity in the establishment of an international auxiliary language, together with research and experiment.

Although it was created to determine which auxiliary language was best suited for international communication, it eventually determined that none of them was up to the task and developed its own language, Interlingua. The IALA continued to publish materials in and about Interlingua until 1954.

ARP Spoofing

ARP Spoofing is a method someone (e.g a hacker) could use to redirect traffic from a computer through their's and then to the internet. This allows the hacker to then read all traffic sent from or to the computer. This will reveal passwords, credit card numbers, and other private information.

A symptom of this sort of attack is a window when browsing to a secure site that says something along the lines of "This website's authentication check has failed". This means that the hacker has forged a secure connection that cannot be verified and thus the warning is presented.

Hatshepsut

Hatshepsut, meaning "Foremost of Noble Ladies", (1508–1458 BC), was the fifth Pharaoh of the 18th dynasty of Ancient Egypt. She is generally regarded by Egyptologists as one of the most successful pharaohs, reigning longer than any other woman of an indigenous Egyptian dynasty. 

Her father was Thutmose I; her predecessor was Thutmose II (her brother and husband); her successor was Thutmose III, the son of Thutmose II by a lesser wife. Tuthmose III was co-regent with his stepmother, and was head of the army, but Hatshepsut was the effective ruler, and the named Pharaoh.

Today it is generally recognized that Hatshepsut assumed the position of Pharaoh. The length of her reign usually is given as twenty-two years, since she was assigned a reign of twenty-one years and nine months by the third-century B.C. historian, Manetho, who had access to many records that now are lost. Her death is known to have occurred in 1458 BC, which implies that she became pharaoh circa 1479 BC.
Hatshepsut established the trade networks that had been disrupted during the Hyksos occupation of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period.

Although many Egyptologists have claimed that her foreign policy was mainly peaceful, there is evidence that Hatshepsut led successful military campaigns in Nubia, the Levant, and Syria early in her career.

Hatshepsut was one of the most prolific builders in ancient Egypt, commissioning hundreds of construction projects throughout both Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt, that were grander and more numerous than those of any of her Middle Kingdom predecessors. Later pharaohs attempted to claim some of her projects as theirs.

She employed the great architect Ineni, who also had worked for her father, her husband, and for the royal vizier Senemut. During her reign, so much statuary was produced that almost every major museum in the world has Hatshepsut statuary among their collections; for instance, the Hatshepsut Room in New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art is dedicated solely to some of these pieces.

Following the tradition of most pharaohs, Hatshepsut had monuments constructed at the Temple of Karnak. She also restored the original Precinct of Mut, an ancient goddess of Egypt, at Karnak that had been ravaged by the Hyksos occupation. She had twin obelisks, at the time the tallest in the world, erected at the entrance to the temple. One still stands, as the tallest surviving ancient obelisk on Earth; the other has broken in two and toppled.

Following the tradition of many pharaohs, the masterpiece of Hatshepsut's building projects was her mortuary temple. She built hers in a complex at Deir el-Bahri. It was designed and implemented by Senemut at a site on the West Bank of the Nile River near the entrance to what now is called the Valley of the Kings. The focal point was the Djeser-Djeseru or "the Sublime of Sublimes", a structure of perfect harmony nearly one thousand years before the Parthenon was built. Djeser-Djeseru sits atop a series of agricultural terraces that once were graced with lush gardens. Djeser-Djeseru is built into a cliff face that rises sharply above it. Djeser-Djeseru and the other buildings of Hatshepsut's Deir el-Bahri complex are considered to be significant advances in architecture. Another of her accomplishments is the Hatshepsut needle (the granite obelisk).

Women had a high status in ancient Egypt and enjoyed the legal right to own, inherit, or will property. A woman becoming pharaoh was rare, however; only Khentkaues, Sobekneferu, and Neferneferuaten preceded her in known records as ruling solely in their own name. Twosret, a female king and the last pharaoh of the nineteenth dynasty, may have been the only woman to succeed her among the indigenous rulers. 

In Egyptian history, there was no word for a "queen regnant" and by the time of her reign, "Pharaoh" had become the name for the ruler. Hatshepsut is not unique, however, in taking the title. Sobekneferu, ruling six dynasties before Hatshepsut, also did so when she ruled Egypt. Hatshepsut had been well trained in her duties as the daughter of the pharaoh. During her father's reign she held the powerful office of "God's Wife". She had taken a strong role as queen to her husband and was well experienced in the administration of her kingdom by the time she became pharaoh. There is no indication of challenges to her leadership and, until her death, her co-regent remained in a secondary role, quite amicably heading her powerful army—which would have given him the power necessary to overthrow a usurper of his rightful place, if that had been the case.

Hatshepsut assumed all of the regalia and symbols of the pharaonic office in official representations. Many existing statues alternatively show her in typically feminine attire as well as those that depict her in the royal ceremonial attire. Statues portraying Sobekneferu also combine elements of traditional male and female iconography and, by tradition, may have served as inspiration for these works commissioned by Hatshepsut. After this period of transition ended, however, most formal depictions of Hatshepsut as pharaoh showed her in the royal attire, with all of the pharaonic regalia.

Modern scholars, however, have theorized that by assuming the typical symbols of pharaonic power, Hatshepsut was asserting her claim to be the sovereign rather than a "King's Great Wife" or queen consort. The gender of pharaohs was never stressed in official depictions; even the men were depicted with the highly stylized false beard associated with their position in the society.

Moreover, the "Osirian statues" of Hatshepsut—as with other pharaohs—depict the dead pharaoh as Osiris, with the body and regalia of that deity. All of the statues of Hatshepsut at her tomb follow that tradition. The promise of resurrection after death was a tenet of the cult of Osiris. Since many statues of Hatshepsut depicted in this fashion have been put on display in museums and those images have been widely published, viewers who lack an understanding of the religious significance of these depictions have been misled.

Most of the official statues commissioned of Hatshepsut show her less symbolically and more naturally, as a woman in typical dresses of the nobility of her day. Notably, even after assuming the formal regalia, Hatshepsut still described herself as a beautiful woman, often as the most beautiful of women, and although she assumed almost all of her father's titles, she declined to take the title "The Strong Bull" (the full title being, "The Strong Bull of his Mother"), which tied the pharaoh to the goddesses Isis, "the throne", and Hathor, (the cow who gave birth to and protected the pharaohs)—by being her son sitting on her throne—an unnecessary title for her, since Hatshepsut became allied with the goddesses, herself, which no male pharaoh could. Rather than the strong bull, Hatshepsut, having served as a very successful warrior during the early portion of her reign as pharaoh, associated herself with the lioness image of Sekhmet, the major war deity in the Egyptian pantheon.

The Oracle of Amun proclaimed that it was the will of Amun that Hatshepsut be pharaoh, further strengthening her position. She reiterated Amun's support by having these proclamations by the god Amun carved on her monuments:

Slime mould

Slime moulds, or Slime molds, are forms of life which live on the rainforest floor, and many other parts of the world. They slither over ground and fallen tree trunks in search of food. They scatter spores, like plants, which grow into new slime moulds.

They are a way of life, or life-form, which has evolved a number of times. Because they are not a monophyletic group, they are put into several different phyla. They have some features of fungi and some features of protozoa. This was discussed by Anton de Bary in 1858.

They spend part of their lives as isolated cells, but come together when a chemical signal is released. Then together, they form a multicellular organism which reproduces and makes spores. So they are both single-celled and multicellular. That is not all: the multicellular form loses its cell walls, and becomes a syncytium. This is an organism with many nuclei, but few or no cell walls.

The single cells are amoeboid (amoeba-like) and haploid (one set of chromosomes, like our gametes). The multi-nuclear stage is called a "plasmodium". It is diploid, formed from fusions between pairs of amoeboid cells. It gains nutrition by phagocytosing bacteria and food particles.

As the food supply fades, the plasmodium makes haploid cells by meiosis, and they form the basis of spores. The spores are kept and then distributed from a structure like a sporangium. This life-cycle is typical of the main group called Mycetozoa.

Modern molecular biology has shown by sequence analysis that slime molds are not a monophyletic group. They were once regarded as fungi, but now they are split into three different groups, and none of them are fungi. Relationships between the groups are not yet understood.

Bikonts are eukaryote cells with two flagellae. There are three groups, which have evolved slime mold form independently.



"Fonticula" is a cellular slime mold which forms a fruiting body in a volcano shape. "Fonticula" is not closely related to either the Dictyosteliida or the Acrasidae. A 2009 paper finds it to be related to "Nuclearia", which in turn is related to fungi.

Chevrotains, also known as mouse deer, are small even-toed ungulates that make up the family Tragulidae

Mouse deer live in Asia. They are about the size of a hare, with short, thin legs. They stamp their small feet to signal to each other. Mouse deer are extremely nervous. When they are surprised, they freeze immediately, and then run away in a zig-zag through the forest.

Crab spider

Crab spiders are the Thomisidae family of spiders. They have two front pairs of legs angled outward and bodies that are flattened and often angular. Also, like crabs, Thomisidae can move sideways or backward. 

Crab spiders use their powerful front legs to grab and hold onto prey while paralyzing it with a venomous bite.

Crab spiders are hunters and ambushers. Some species sit on or among flowers, bark, fruit or leaves where they grab visiting insects. Their species use camouflage: several different types are known. 

Some species are disguised as birds' droppings resting on a leaf. Even at a close range, it is difficult to tell the difference. Crab spiders live in rainforests all over the world. They get their name from the way they scuttle around, like small crabs.

Julia Gillard

Julia Eileen Gillard (born 29 September 1961) is the 27th Prime Minister of Australia. She is the first woman to become Prime Minister of Australia. She is also Australia's first prime minister never to have married. Gillard is the first prime minster not born in Australia since Billy Hughes, who served from 1915 to 1923.

Gillard became the leader of the Australian Labor Party on 24 June 2010 when Kevin Rudd resigned. She had been Deputy Prime Minister under Kevin Rudd. On 11 December 2007, she became the first woman in Australia's history to take on the prime-ministerial role when she was the acting prime minister while Rudd went to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali.

Gillard has been a Labor Party member of the House of Representatives since the 1998 federal election. She represents the Division of Lalor, in western suburbs of Melbourne.

Gillard was born in 1961 in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, Wales. Nye Bevan remains one of her political heroes. She had bronchopneumonia as a child, and her parents were told it would be better if she lived in a warmer climate. The family came to Australia in 1966, settling in Adelaide. Her parents, John and Moira, live in Pasadena, South Australia. She has a sister, Alison, who is three years older. 

Gillard's father was a psychiatric nurse, while her mother worked at the local Salvation Army nursing home. She and her sister went to Mitcham Demonstration School, and Julia went on to attend Unley High School. She studied at the University of Adelaide but cut short her courses in 1982 and moved to Melbourne to work with the Australian Union of Students. She graduated from the University of Melbourne with Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degrees in 1986.

In 1987, Gillard joined the law firm Slater & Gordon at Werribee, Melbourne, working in industrial law. In 1990 at the age of 29, she became one of their first female partners.

In 2007 Gillard said: "I used to think I wanted to be a school teacher. There was an English teacher at Mitcham Primary [in Adelaide], who was a real stickler for standards and grammar and punctuation but who was also very kindly. I thought teachers were good; I thought it would be a rewarding job, seeing the eyes of young people light up with new information. I got talked out of that ambition for good or for ill by a school friend's mother, who said, 'No, you're really good at arguing and debating, you should try law.' If I hadn't been pre-selected for the seat of Lalor and run successfully in the 1998 election, I'd probably still be somewhere in and around the law; public sector law perhaps. Maybe giving tutorials, trying to pound law into other people's heads."

While at the University of Adelaide, she joined the Labor Club and became involved in a campaign to fight state education budget cuts.

Moving to Melbourne, in 1983, Gillard became the second woman to lead the Australian Union of Students. Gillard was also the secretary of the left-wing organisation, Socialist Forum. Members of the Socialist Forum lobbied for the scrapping of the ANZUS treaty, making Leningrad a sister city of Melbourne, and introducing a super-tax on the rich. 

From 1996 to 1998, Gillard was Chief of Staff to John Brumby, at that time the Victorian opposition leader. She was responsible for drafting the affirmative action rules within the Labor Party in Victoria that set the target of preselecting women for 35 per cent of 'winnable seats' within a decade. She also played a role in starting EMILY's List, the pro-choice fund-raising and support network for Labor women.

Gillard was elected as Member for Lalor in the House of Representatives at the 1998 election, replacing Barry Jones, who had retired. She made her first speech to the house on 11 November 1998.

After Labor's defeat at the 2001 election, Gillard was elected to the shadow cabinet, with the portfolio of population and immigration. In February 2003, she was given the additional portfolios of reconciliation and Indigenous affairs.

After the Tampa and Children Overboard affairs, which were partly credited with Labor's 2001 election loss, Gillard worked on a new immigration policy for the Labor Party.

Gillard was promoted to the position of Shadow Health Minister in July 2003. Shortly after this, the government moved Workplace Relations Minister Tony Abbott to the health portfolio. The rivalry between Abbott and Gillard often attracted attention from the media. She gained additional responsibility for managing opposition business in the House of Representatives.

After the Labor loss at the October 2004 election, some people thought that Gillard might challenge Jenny Macklin for the deputy leadership, but she did not do so.

Gillard had been spoken of as a future leader of the party for some years but, until 2005, she stayed out of leadership contests. After Mark Latham resigned as leader in January 2005, she was seen as a possible new leader, along with Kim Beazley and Kevin Rudd.

She was on the ABC's "Australian Story" program in March 2006, A poll in April 2006, for Network Ten's "Meet the Press" program, found that people wanted Gillard to be Labor leader. She polled 32% compared with Beazley's 25% and Kevin Rudd's 18%.

Although she had a lot of support, she said on 25 January 2005 that she would not contest the leadership. This allowed Beazley to be elected unopposed.

On 1 December 2006, with Kevin Rudd, Gillard launched a challenge for the deputy leadership of the ALP. Once Rudd was elected as leader, the incumbent deputy leader and Kim Beazley's deputy, Jenny Macklin, chose not to contest the position and on 4 December 2006 she was elected unopposed. In the frontbench reshuffle following the leadership change, Gillard was given the Employment, Workplace Relations and Social Inclusion portfolios.

The Labor Party won the 2007 federal election and, on 3 December 2007, Gillard was sworn in as the first female Deputy Prime Minister of Australia.

As well as being deputy prime ministership, Gillard was also in charge of the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. She had three titles: Minister for Education; Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations; and Minister for Social Inclusion. As Minister for Education, Gillard went to Washington, DC, where she signed a deal with the US Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, to enourage improved policy collaboration in education reform between both countries.
On 11 December 2007 she became the first woman in Australia's history to be in the prime ministerial role when she became acting prime minister while Kevin Rudd went to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali. In the first year of government, she served as acting prime minister for 69 days while Rudd was overseas.

Gillard is a highly regarded debater, and has been described as "the best parliamentary performer on the Labor side".

Gillard removed the WorkChoices industrial relations laws introduced by the Howard government, and replaced it with the "Fair Work Bill". This set up a single industrial relations bureaucracy called Fair Work Australia.

In 2009 Gillard was in charge of the government's "Building the Education Revolution" program, which gave AU$16 billion to build new school classrooms, libraries and assembly halls.

On 23 June 2010, there were several meetings between Gillard and Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, as well as other Labor party leaders. Rudd spoke to the media at 10:30 pm AEST and said that Gillard had asked him to resign or hold a leadership ballot of the 115 Labor party politicians. This would decide who was to be the leader of the Labor Party and therefore the Prime Minister of Australia. 

At first Rudd said he would challenge Gillard at the meeting. However, hours before the vote, he resigned as leader when he knew that he did not have enough support to defeat Gillard. She won the election unopposed. At the same meeting the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, was elected unopposed to succeed Gillard as Labor's deputy leader, and hence Deputy Prime Minister. 

Shortly afterward, Gillard was sworn in as the 27th Prime Minister of Australia by the Governor-General, Quentin Bryce, and Wayne Swan was sworn in as her deputy.

Later the same day, Gillard in her first speech said that "It is my intention to lead a government that is focused each and every day on meeting the needs of working families around the country" and acknowledged that at times the Rudd Government "went off the tracks ... I came to the view that a good Government was losing its way".

Gillard is a member of the Left faction of the Labor party. Analyses of Jacqueline Kent's 2009 biography of Gillard suggest that her membership in the faction is "more organisational than ideological".

On population policy, in contrast to her predecessor, Gillard is against a "big Australia". She emphasises the need for sustainability, saying "Australia should not hurtle down the track towards a big population".

Gillard is pro-choice on reproductive rights. She does not support gay marriage.

Gillard's partner since 2006 is Tim Mathieson. She had previous relationships with union officials Michael O'Connor and Bruce Wilson and fellow Federal Labor MP Craig Emerson. She has never married and has had no children. 

When asked in 2010 on the ABC's Jon Faine program, "Do you believe in God?", Gillard answered, "No, I don't Jon, I'm not a religious person ... I'm, of course, a great respecter of religious beliefs but they're not my beliefs". Newly appointed Prime Ministers must take an affirmation of office, or swear an oath of office on the Bible. Gillard chose an affirmation.

She lives in the south western Melbourne suburb of Altona and is a public supporter of the Western Bulldogs Australian Rules Football club.

The Political Cesspool

The Political Cesspool is a weekly talk radio show syndicated by Liberty News Radio Network, and Accent Radio Network.First broadcast in 2004 twice a week from radio station WMQM, it is currently broadcast from Millington, Tennessee, from radio station WLRM on Saturday nights.

According to its statement of principles, the program stands for "The Dispossessed Majority", represents "a philosophy that is pro-White", and is "against political centralization." It has attracted criticism from "The Nation", "The New Republic", the Stephen Roth Institute, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the Anti-Defamation League for promoting anti-Jewish and racist views.

The show features founder and main host James Edwards, co-hosts Bill Rolen, Winston Smith, Keith Alexander, and Eddie Miller, and producer Art Frith; former staffers include Jess Bonds and co-founder Austin Farley. Its guests have included author Jerome Corsi, Minuteman Project leader Jim Gilchrist, former Constitution Party presidential candidate Michael Peroutka, actor Sonny Landham, British National Party leader Nick Griffin, Vermont secessionist Thomas Naylor, and paleoconservative activist Pat Buchanan. It is carried by at least three licensed radio stations in the United States, in addition to one unlicensed Part 15 station and the satellite Galaxy 19.

James Edwards and Austin Farley established "The Political Cesspool" on October 26, 2004, as a paleoconservative alternative to GOP radio shows such as the Sean Hannity Show; in Farley's words, the show focused on efforts "to preserve our Southern heritage and its symbols," while James Edwards described the show as "politically incorrect". It was initially broadcast on AM 1600 WMQM, a Memphis-based radio station, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Edwards and Farley invited friends Bill Rolen, who is a board member of the Council of Conservative Citizens, and Jess Bonds as guest hosts, as well as radio expert Art Frith. Before, Frith had worked for a number of other radio stations including American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS) (in Keflavik, Iceland; Anchorage, Alaska; and Nea Makri, Greece), KFQD (in Anchorage), and WBCK (in Battle Creek, Michigan).

In 2005, the group moved to WMQM's Millington-based sister station, AM 1380 WLRM, and switched to a nightly schedule, Monday through Friday. Farley left the program in November of that year. Two years later, Goeff Melton joined to help set up the show's official website and the show entered syndication with Dixie Broadcasting Radio Network. The program went on hiatus on February 15, 2008, because staff members said they "needed a break".

In June 2008, the show returned to the airwaves on WLRM, but airing only on Saturday nights (its schedule as of 2010). One year later, the show switched from Republic Broadcasting Network to Liberty News Radio Network, with which it is currently associated. As of August 2009, Bonds and Melton are no longer linked with the program. Frith now lives in Nashville, Michigan, but remains a part of the show's staff. Since WLRM is not audited by Arbitron, the show's ratings are unknown.

"The Political Cesspool" describes its views as "pro-White" and "against political centralization". Its statement of principles, borrowed from the Council of Conservative Citizens, reads:

"The Political Cesspool Radio Program" stands for the The Dispossessed Majority. We represent a philosophy that is pro-White and are against political centralization. You can trust "The Political Cesspool" to give you the "other side of the news"—to report on events which are vital to your welfare but which would otherwise be hushed up or distorted by the controlled press.

We make no attempt to give you "both sides." We'll leave the establishment side to your daily newspaper, television and other radio shows. We will bring to you some of the most renowned thinkers, writers, pundits, activists, entertainers and elected officials each broadcast as our guests. Furthermore, we pledge that The Political Cesspool will correct any meaningful error or fact. Make up your own mind who is being honest with you: the establishment media or "The Political Cesspool Radio Program".


James Edwards, a lifelong resident of Memphis, Tennessee, is the co-founder and primary host of "The Political Cesspool". In 2000, Edwards volunteered for Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign. He later said that this experience inspired him to become politically active, and he wrote an essay called "Why I Love Pat Buchanan" in which he stated his view that Buchanan "tells it like it is". Edwards ran for the Tennessee House of Representatives in 2002 and lost. During the campaign he met fellow right-wing political activist Austin Farley, who later became a cohost of "The Political Cesspool". Edwards sits on the Board of Directors of the American Third Position Party, a political cohort that advocates white nationalism —and a form of economic nationalism known as Third Position "The Nation" wrote that Edwards "has leveraged sponsorship from neo-Nazi and Holocaust denial groups to become America's most popular white supremacist radio host."

Other staff of "The Political Cesspool" include co-hosts Eddie "The Bombardier" Miller, Keith Alexander, and Winston Smith. Most of the show's staff claim descent from Confederate soldiers.

"The Political Cesspool" has over the years featured many guest appearances, including political activists, Holocaust deniers, economists, and musicians. Former Tennessee gubernatorial candidate Carl "Twofeathers" Whitaker, who claims partial Native American ancestry and is known for his strong support of the Minuteman movement, has appeared on the show, as has conservative Native American activist David Yeagley. Filmmakers Merlin Miller ("A Place to Grow", "Jericho") and Craig Bodeker ("A Conversation about Race") have featured.

Author Jerome Corsi was interviewed in July 2008. During the discussion he spoke about his financial newsletter, and promoted his "New York Times" number one bestselling book "The Obama Nation". The interview included several statements that have been widely described as racist; for example, he opined that US President Barack Obama identifies more with his "African blood" than his American roots and that the President "rejects everyone white, including his mother and his grandparents". Corsi scheduled another promotional appearance on the "The Political Cesspool" one month later, however, he canceled this appearance, citing "travel plans that changed". James Edwards said that he believed the incident "just goes to show what incredible pressure everyone in public life is under to never have anything to do with anyone who speaks up for the interests of white people." Fellow authors John Derbyshire and Steve Sailer have also been guests.

Constitution Party nominee Michael Peroutka used his appearance in 2004 to promote his presidential campaign. Party member Michael Goza described the show as "Christian/Constitutionalist", and "a great blessing to our cause". Thomas Naylor, of the Vermont secessionist organization Second Vermont Republic, appeared on the show to celebrate Confederate History Month in April 2007, while American Third Position Party Chairman Bill Johnson appeared to promote his party.

On May 8, 2006, Minuteman Project leader Jim Gilchrist spoke on the program. Co-host Bill Rolen agreed with Gilchrist's view that illegal immigrants' intentions are to "just squat here and plunder whatever social benefits our programs provide them". However, Rolen disagreed with Gilchrist's claim that illegal immigration was "the 21st century slave trade". Gilchrist's colleague in the Minuteman movement, Chris Simcox, has also been a guest of the show.

Paleoconservative activist and former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan has appeared twice as of May 2009. In a June 2008 interview arranged by his publicist, he promoted his book "Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War". During the broadcast, Buchanan defended Charles Lindbergh against charges of saying bad things about Jews, stating that his reputation "has been blackened because of a single speech he gave and a couple of paragraphs in it where he said that ... the Jewish community is beating the drums for war  but frankly, no one has said what he said was palpably untrue." At the end of the interview, James Edwards said, "Mr. Buchanan, thank you so much for coming back on our program, for fighting for our people." Previously, in September 2006, Buchanan had made an appearance to promote his book "State of Emergency"; during this interview, he said that “we are being invaded by people of different cultures” and argued that Americans “cannot survive a bifurcated culture or a heavily Hispanicized culture, tilted towards Mexico ... I think that's the beginning of the end of the United States.”
Self proclaimed "racial realist" Jared Taylor, whom James Edwards considers to be a close friend, has appeared at least ten times. In an article he wrote for "VDARE", Taylor described the program as "racially oriented". Although describing itself as "America First", the show has also hosted foreign guests, including Croatian racist Tomislav Sunić, Australian white nationalist Drew Fraser, Russian Austrian School economist Yuri Maltsev, British lawyer Adrian Davies, Canadian conservative blogger Kathy Shaidle, and British National Party (BNP) leaders Simon Darby and Nick Griffin; Griffin appeared as a guest before and after his election to the European Parliament. During his post-election appearance, Griffin attributed the BNP's electoral successes to a fear of "creeping process of Islamification".

The show has frequently been criticised by anti-racist groups and persons over its stated views, such as the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Stephen Roth Institute, and writer Max Blumenthal. "The Political Cesspool" was added to the Southern Poverty Law Center's hate group watch list in 2006. James Edwards was "ecstatic", saying "I don't think you've arrived in the conservative movement until you've made it to the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hate Watch". Edwards describes the SPLC as a group composed of "communists and civil rights hustlers". The SPLC's Hatewatch has referred to "The Political Cesspool" as "an overtly racist, anti-Semitic radio show hosted by [a] self-avowed white nationalist" and as "the nexus of hate in America". The Anti-Defamation League has also criticized the show; Edwards has attacked the ADL as "America's most powerful hate group" and has claimed that its definition of a "neo-Nazi [is] any white person who disagrees with a Jew".

Writer Max Blumenthal, who reported on an attempt by one of the show's staff to advertise at a rally for former Alaska governor and Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, described "The Political Cesspool" as having a "racist ideology", and highlighted anti-Jewish, racist, and homophobic comments that Edwards had made on his blog. The Stephen Roth Institute has also written about the show, noting that "[James] Edwards openly espoused many of his guests' views and during speeches to extremist audiences, including members of the white supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens and the racist League of the South, he gained the support of a wide array of extremists." In an article about antisemitism in Belgium, the Stephen Roth Institute commented on the show's interview with Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian Parliament and a leader of the Vlaams Belang movement. "Newsweek" magazine used one of co-host Winston Smith's statements to argue that the rise in popularity of white racism is due to the combination of the late-2000s recession and the election of a black president. Many such groups have been attempting to gain new recruits and increase their political power by rebranding themselves as defenders of "white heritage" while trying to hide their dislike of minorities and Jews. Smith states, "[t]he emphasis is different now. We don't talk as much about what blacks have done to us; we're more focused on ourselves and our own culture."

In 2005, the staff of "The Political Cesspool" organized a rally at Confederate Park, which, along with two other Confederacy-themed parks in downtown Memphis, has been the subject of a longtime disagreement for honoring Confederate soldiers and ideals. The park had been criticized earlier by a black Shelby County official, which attracted the notice of New York-based activist Al Sharpton, who was invited by the Reverend LaSimba Gray to hold a demonstration in Memphis. Sharpton planned a march called the Rally for Dignity from downtown Memphis to another park honoring Confederate Lieutenant General Nathan Bedford Forrest who was involved early in the organization of the Ku Klux Klan. Sharpton canceled the march after Edwards and "The Political Cesspool" staff obtained a permit to demonstrate in Confederate Park, located along Sharpton's planned march route.

Sharpton settled for a protest at Forrest Park. At the demonstration, he argued that "We need to show the rest of the world that the day for honoring people like this is over", and said in an interview that his objections were not related to race but to Forrest's Civil War-era (1861–1865) actions against the United States. Estimates of attendance at the rallies vary; according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, James Edwards attracted about 200 white counter-demonstrators to the Confederate Park vigil, while Sharpton's protest at Forrest Park attracted a few dozen black demonstrators, whom Edwards referred to as "rabble". The "Memphis Flyer" estimated that Sharpton attracted about 250 supporters. In the aftermath of the city park controversy, show affiliates Edwards, Farley, Bonds, and Rolen received the "Dixie Defender Award" from the Sons of Confederate Veterans.

Later that year, Memphis city councilman E. C. Jones awarded Edwards and Farley with a certificate "in appreciation of outstanding contributions to the community". Edwards and Farley also received an honorary city council membership from Jones, who had previously appeared on "The Political Cesspool". According to "The Commercial Appeal", Jones had not listened to the show before the incident, and was unaware of its views. After a reporter informed him of the show's views, Jones initially refused to say he was sorry. However, after another reporter confronted him with more details about the show's ideology, he changed his view, saying that he probably would not appear again. Carol Chumney, another member of the Memphis City Council, was also invited to appear on "The Political Cesspool", but ultimately declined the invitation after listening to an episode of the show; Chumney said, "what I heard was about advocating for prostitution ... So I told them I had other commitments." 

"The Political Cesspool" airs on four stations as of 2010: WLRM in Millington, Tennessee, KHQN in Spanish Fork, Utah, 
KNAK-AM in Delta, Utah, and micro1650am in Tonawanda, New York; it is also broadcast from the satellite Galaxy 19. The Accent Radio Network-affiliated stations KHQN and KNAK-AM currently air a shortened version of the show (two hours), in contrast to the three-hour Liberty News Radio Network (WLRM) version. Galaxy 19 airs the full lineups of both ARN and Liberty News Radio Network on separate channels, and as such it airs both the long version and short version of the show. One of the stations, micro1650am, is a 100-milliwatt FCC Part 15 station, and as such it has no call letters.

In Mathematics, a Pythagorean triple is a set of three positive integers which satisfy the equation (make the equation work):
This equation is known as the Diophantine equation, and is related to Pythagoras' theorem.
The lowest Pythagorean triple is [3, 4, 5] because:
The next highest triple is [5, 12, 13] then [7, 24, 25], and so on.
There is an infinite number of Pythagorean triples.

A Pythagorean Triple always consists of:

To tackle other comments above, leave the knowledge groups and tackle the articles. Portals will die (, , & and take up man power we don't have for nothing in particularly useful (They're not going to improve articles!). Interwikis, I'd support removal of 500 & 100+ sections, but nothing more than that because by 5k they're going to be quite established. Likewise, we can only remove full sections - removing certain wikis (As was done before...) promotes 'favouritism' - it's not fair to only list some. 11:04, 25 June 2010 (UTC) 

Not sure there is much point for you to design this at the moment as the community a little while ago rejected switching to vector. Don't know if that has changed or not. - () 11:52, 25 June 2010 (UTC)

You guys have such great ideas and feedback! Feel free to make some changes yourselves. I give all of you carte blanche. After all, this is the encyclopedia that anyone can edit. 09:25, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

I have read the arguments for and against and have determined that no consensus exists either for or against the feature being adopted.

An issue has come up about the use of the flag templates. There are two questions I would like addressed.

The basic question about the use of templates is a trade-off between ease of coding and speed of execution. But there is more to it than just that.
Some facts to put this issue into perspective:

My opinion is that if capable editors for en want rollback, and if it'll keep them around just a bit longer to contribute some useful content, by all means just give it to them. If they disappear, no big deal: we have an unlimited supply of rollback checkmarks. If push comes to shove, we can always remove the rollback flag after a certain period of time (ie. six months). – |  12:40, 13 July 2010 (UTC)

Christian Wulff

Christian Wilhelm Walter Wulff (born 19 June 1959) is a German politician of the conservative Christian Democratic Union. He was elected to be the President of Germany on 30 June 2010. He served as Minister-President of the state of Lower Saxony from 2003 to 2010.

Wulff was born in Osnabrück and is Roman Catholic. His father left the family, and he grew up with his mother. As a teenager, he had to take responsibility for the care of his younger sister, after his mother developed multiple sclerosis. After completing his Abitur the Gymnasium in Osnabrück, Wulff went to study law. He specialised in economic law at the University of Osnabrück. In 1987 and 1990, he passed the first and second state examinations in law. He started to work as a lawyer.

Since 1975, Wulff has been a member of the CDU. From 1978 to 1980, he served as federal chairman of the "Schülerunion". This was a political high school student organization connected to the Christian Democrats. He became the regional chairman of the Junge Union in Lower Saxony in 1983. In 1986, he was elected a city councillor in his hometown. Since 1984, he has sat on the CDU's regional party council of Lower Saxony, serving as its chairman since 1994.

The Christian Democrats made Wulff candidate for state Prime Minister in 1994. However, the popular office holder Gerhard Schröder won. After four years in opposition, the election in 1998 brought another opportunity for Wulff to become Prime Minister. Indeed, the federal Christian Democrat party, led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, made Wulff another time the candidate.

Wulff has been one of the four deputy chairmen of the CDU party at the federal level since 7 November 1998. He has also been a board member of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation since 2003.

With Lower Saxony announcing deeper cuts of education and municipal services, the stage was set for the 2003 election campaign. Wulff entered the race as the favourite to win the election. The Christian Democrats, in the political wilderness since 1990, were returned to power in the Legislative Assembly, gaining 48.3% of the vote. Wulff was sworn in as Prime Minister on 4 March 2003, as the head of a coalition between centre-right Christian Democrats and liberal Free Democrats (FDP).

As Minister-President, Wulff has made a multitude of reforms. This includes a restructuring of the primary education system in Lower Saxony, as well as an increase of police officers. When Wulff took office, Lower Saxony faced a severe budget crisis. It was the result from years of public deficits. Painful cuts to public expenditure were enacted and implemented against considerable political resistance. The measures included cuts in university funding and in benefits for the blind. Other policies concern the reform of the administration. Many measures have remained controversial.

Prior to the 2005 Federal Election, Wulff had been mentioned as a potential candidate for the German chancellorship. Surprisingly, in a spring 2005 poll, 28 percent of all respondents named Wulff as their preferred candidate for the Christian Democrat nomination for Chancellor in the 2006 election. As Wulff only began his first term as Prime Minister in early 2003, he is likely to dismiss such speculations. in December 2014, Wulff was re-elected deputy leader of the federal party with about 86 per cent of all delegates supporting him.

In a speech, Wulff expressed his opposition to euthanasia and warned of a retreat of moral values. This can be seen as the first attempt to formulate a value-based agenda for the 2008 legislative assembly, and the 2009 federal elections. In this context, it is important to note that Chancellor Angela Merkel had been severely criticized for a lack of emotional warmth during the 2005 federal election campaign.

Due to his popularity in Lower Saxony, and in federal opinion polls, Wulff was considered to be a contender for the office of Chancellor.

After the 23 May announcement that federal elections will be advanced to September 2005, Wulff announced that he was not a candidate for the CDU nomination for Chancellor. He has not completed his first term as Premier of Lower Saxony. Instead, Wulff declared his support for Angela Merkel. She was the CDU leader in the Bundestag. It was expected that the Christian Democrats would win the election and form a government, and that Wulff would be given a position in this government. However, with the September 18 election resulting in a hung parliament, the outcome is unclear. Wulff continued to be named as a possible CDU candidate for Chancellor, particularly if Chancellor Merkel failed to secure a decisive mandate in the 2009 federal election.

Christian Wulff was elected President of Germany on 30 June 2010. He gon 625 of 1242 votes in the third ballot of the Federal Convention. He is Germany's youngest President (51 years) and the first Roman Catholic President in more than forty years (the last Roman Catholic President was Heinrich Lübke). Wullf was sworn in on 2 July 2010 in front of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat.

His main rival in the election was Joachim Gauck, a civil rights activist from East Germany and a former Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Archives. Not a member of any party, Gauck was nominated by the opposition SPD and Greens as their presidential candidate on 3 June.

Wulff is succeeded as Prime Minister of Lower Saxony by David McAllister. Wulff's candidacy for President of Germany in the 2010 presidential election was formally confirmed by Angela Merkel, Guido Westerwelle and Horst Seehofer. They are the heads of the CDU, FDP and CSU parties.

Christian Wulff met his first wife, lawyer Christiane Wulff (born 1959), when they were both law students in Osnabrück in 1983. They married in March 1988, and have a daughter, Annalena (born 1993). In June 2006, Wulff announced that he would divorce his wife. In 2008, Wulff married an aide from the Prime Minister's Office, Bettina Körner (born 1973 in Hanover). She has a son from a previous relationship. On 12 May 2008, she gave birth to their first child together, also a boy.

Claude Bernard

Claude Bernard (12 July 1813 – 10 February 1878) was a French physiologist. He has been called "one of the greatest of all men of science". He was one of the first to suggest ways to scientific observations more objective (free of bias). He was the first to define the term "milieu interieur"; this is homeostasis, a term coined by Walter B. Cannon.

Bernard made animal experimentation a part of the standard scientific method. He famously wrote in 1865 that "the science of life is a superb and dazzlingly lit hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen".

He was born in 1813 in Saint-Julien near Villefranche-sur-Saône. He wrote comedies and other plays. When he was 21 he went to Paris with his play and went to a critic. But the critic suggested for him to study medicine instead of literature.

In 1845 Bernard married Françoise Marie (Fanny) Martin for her money. Her money helped him in his experiments, but she was firmly against his methods, and founded the first French society for anti-vivisectionists. When he died Bernard was given a public funeral. This was something which had never been given by France to a man of science before.

Lee Kuan Yew

Lee Kuan Yew, GCMG, CH (Honorary) (Christian name: Harry, ; born 16 September 1923; also Lee Kwan-Yew) is a Singaporean politician. He was the first Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore from 1959 to 1990. 

He was the co-founder and first secretary-general of the People's Action Party (PAP), and led the party to a landslide victory in 1959. During his leadership, Singapore separated from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965 and grew from an underdeveloped colonial outpost with no natural resources into a "First World", Asian Tiger. He has remained one of the most influential political figures in South-East Asia. 

Under Singapore's second prime minister Goh Chok Tong, Lee served as Senior Minister. He is currently Minister Mentor, a post created when his son Lee Hsien Loong became the nation's third prime minister on 12 August 2004.

On 13 September 2008, Lee, 84, underwent successful treatment for abnormal heart rhythm (atrial flutter) at Singapore General Hospital, but he was still able to address a philanthropy forum via video link from hospital.

Lee says in his autobiography that he is a fourth-generation Chinese Singaporean: his Hakka great-grandfather, Lee Bok Boon (born 1846), emigrated from the Dapu county of Guangdong province to the Straits Settlements in 1862. 

Lee Kuan Yew was born at 92 Kampong Java Road in Singapore. He was the oldest child of Lee Chin Koon and Chua Jim Neo. As a child he was strongly influenced by British culture, partly because of the influence of his grandfather Lee Hoon Leong, who had given his sons an English education. His grandfather gave him the name "Harry", and his father gave him the Chinese name "Kuan Yew". He was mostly known as "Harry Lee" until he turned 30, and his close friends and family, especially in the West, still know him by that name. He started using his Chinese name after entering politics. His name is sometimes written as Harry Lee Kuan Yew, although this first name is not usually used in official settings.

Lee and his wife Kwa Geok Choo were married on 30 September 1950. They have two sons and one daughter. Kwa Geok Choo's roots can be traced from Min Nan Tong'an.

Many of Lee's family have important positions in Singaporean society, and his children hold high government or government-linked posts. His elder son Lee Hsien Loong, a former Brigadier General, has been the Prime Minister since 2004. He is also the Deputy Chairman of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), of which Lee himself is the chairman. Lee's younger son, Lee Hsien Yang, is also a former Brigadier General and is a former President and Chief Executive Officer of SingTel, a pan-Asian telecommunications giant and Singapore's largest company by market capitalisation (listed on the Singapore Exchange, SGX). Fifty-six percent of SingTel is owned by Temasek Holdings, a prominent government holding company with controlling stakes in a variety of very large government-linked companies such as Singapore Airlines and DBS Bank. Temasek Holdings was until 2009 run by Executive Director and C.E.O. Ho Ching, the wife of Lee Hsien Loong. Lee's daughter, Lee Wei Ling, runs the National Neuroscience Institute. Lee's wife, Kwa Geok Choo, used to be a partner of the prominent legal firm Lee & Lee.

Lee studied at Telok Kurau Primary School, Raffles Institution (where he was a member of the 01 Raffles Scout Group), and Raffles College (now National University of Singapore). He was stopped from going to university by World War II and the 1942-1945 Japanese occupation of Singapore. During the occupation, he ran a successful black market business selling tapioca-based glue called "Stikfas". Because he had taken Chinese and Japanese lessons since 1942, he was able to find work transcribing Allied wire reports for the Japanese, as well as being the English language editor on the Japanese "Hodobu" (報道部 — an information or propaganda department) from 1943 to 1944.
Lee had three main concerns — national security, the economy, and social issues — during his post-independence administration.

The vulnerability of Singapore was deeply felt, with threats from multiple sources including the communists, Indonesia (with its Confrontation stance), and UMNO extremists who wanted to force Singapore back into Malaysia. As Singapore gained admission to the United Nations, Lee quickly sought international recognition of Singapore's independence. He declared a policy of neutrality and non-alignment, following Switzerland's model. At the same time, he asked Goh Keng Swee to build up the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and requested help from other countries for advice, training and facilities.

Like many countries, Singapore was not immune to political corruption. Lee introduced legislation giving the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) greater power to conduct arrests, search, call up witnesses, and investigate bank accounts and income-tax returns of suspected persons and their families. 

Lee believed that ministers should be well paid in order to maintain a clean and honest government. In 1994 he proposed to link the salaries of ministers, judges, and top civil servants to the salaries of top professionals in the private sector, arguing that this would help recruit and retain talent to serve in the public sector.

In the late 1960s, fearing that Singapore's growing population might overburden the developing economy, Lee started a vigorous 'Stop-at-Two' family planning campaign. Couples were urged to undergo sterilisation after their second child. Third or fourth children were given lower priorities in education and such families received fewer economic rebates.

In 1983, Lee sparked the 'Great Marriage Debate' when he encouraged Singapore men to choose highly-educated women as wives. He was concerned that a large number of graduate women were unmarried. Some sections of the population, including graduate women, were upset by his views. Nevertheless, a match-making agency Social Development Unit (SDU) was set up to promote socialising among men and women graduates. Lee also introduced incentives such as tax rebates, schooling, and housing priorities for graduate mothers who had three or four children, in a reversal of the over-successful 'Stop-at-Two' family planning campaign in the 1960s and 1970s. By the late 1990s, the birth rate had fallen so low that Lee's successor Goh Chok Tong extended these incentives to all married women, and gave even more incentives, such as the 'baby bonus' scheme.

During the three decades in which Lee held office, Singapore grew from being a developing country to one of the most developed nations in Asia, despite its small population, limited land space and lack of natural resources. Lee has often stated that Singapore's only natural resources are its people and their strong work ethic. He is widely respected by many Singaporeans, particularly the older generation, who remember his inspiring leadership during independence and the separation from Malaysia.

On the other hand, many Singaporeans have criticized Lee as being authoritarian and intolerant of dissent, citing his numerous mostly successful attempts to sue political opponents and newspapers who express an unfavorable opinion. International media watchdog Reporters Without Borders has asked Lee, and other senior Singaporean officials, to stop taking libel actions against journalists . 

Lee has written a two-volume set of memoirs: "The Singapore Story" (ISBN 0-13-020803-5), which covers his view of Singapore's history until its separation from Malaysia in 1965, and "" (ISBN 0060197765), which gives his account of Singapore's subsequent transformation into a developed nation.


Devan Nair, the third President of Singapore and who was living in exile in Canada, remarked in a 1999 interview with the Toronto "The Globe and Mail" that Lee's technique of suing his opponents into bankruptcy or oblivion was an abrogation of political rights. He also remarked that Lee is "an increasingly self-righteous know-all", surrounded by "department store dummies". In response to these remarks, Lee sued Devan Nair in a Canadian court and Nair countersued. Lee then brought a motion to have Nair's counterclaim thrown out of court. Lee argued that Nair's counterclaim disclosed no reasonable cause of action and constituted an inflammatory attack on the integrity of the government of Singapore. However, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice refused to throw out Nair's counterclaim, holding that Lee had abused the litigating process and therefore Nair has a reasonable cause of action.

On 24 September 2008 the High Court of Singapore, in a summary judgment by Justice Woo Bih Li, ruled that the Far Eastern Economic Review (FEER) magazine (Hugo Restall, editor), defamed Lee and his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. The court found the 2006 article "Singapore's 'Martyr': Chee Soon Juan" meant that Lee Kuan Yew "has been running and continues to run Singapore in the same corrupt manner as T. T. Durai operated the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) and he has been using libel actions to suppress those who would question to avoid exposure of his corruption." The court sentenced FEER, owned by Dow Jones & Company (in turn owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp), to pay damages to the complainants. FEER appealed but lost the case when the Court of Appeal ruled in October, 2009 that the "Far Eastern Economic Review" did defame the country's founder Lee Kuan Yew and his son Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.

Hotspot (geology)

In geology, a hotspot or hot spot is a portion of the Earth's surface which experiences volcanism. This may be caused by a rising mantle plume or some other cause. Hotspots may be far from tectonic plate boundaries. 

A volcanic hotspot is where lava pushes up from under the mantle and creates a volcano. The earth's plates move along and another volcano is created later. This creates a chain of volcanoes, such as in Hawaii.

J. Tuzo Wilson suggested in 1963 that volcanic chains like the Hawaiian Islands result from the slow movement of a tectonic plate across a fixed hot spot deep beneath the surface of the planet. Hotspots are thought to be caused by a narrow stream of hot mantle convecting up from the Earth's core–mantle boundary called a mantle plume, although some geologists prefer upper-mantle convection as a cause.

Geologists have identified some 40–50 such hotspots around the globe. Those under Hawaii, Réunion, Yellowstone, Galápagos Islands, are the most active at present.

Teimour Radjabov, born 12 March 1987 in Baku, Azerbaijan is a leading Azerbaijani chess player. He ranks second in his native Azerbaijan to Shakhriyar Mamedyarov. 

Radjabov earned the title of Grandmaster in March 2001 at the age of 14, making him the second-youngest grandmaster in history at that time (to Bu Xiangzhi). Radjabov's playing style has been described as attacking and tactically influenced.

Radjabov came second in the FIDE Grand Prix 2008–2010, qualifying him for the Candidates tournament for the World Chess Championship of 2012.

Radjabov is the youngest player ever to make the FIDE Top 100 Players list. His rating of 2599 in January 2002 ranked 93rd in the world while he was still 14 years old.

In 2003, Radjabov defeated Garry Kasparov, Viswanathan Anand, and Ruslan Ponomariov with the black pieces. He is probably the first player ever to beat three former and reigning FIDE World Chess Champions with the black pieces in one year.

Radjabov reached the semi-finals (earning a bronze medal) at the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004.

Peak oil

Peak oil is the idea that at some point a country, or the world, will be producing the most oil it can ever produce at one time. After this point, less oil will be produced and therefore people will have to use less oil because it will cost more money. Many scientists and governments are concerned about what will happen when there is less oil to go around.

The first person to come up with this idea was M.K. Hubbert　in the 1950s and 1960s, who said that a graph of oil production looks like a curve (which we now call Hubbert's Curve). Hubbert drew a graph in 1956 that predicted that the United States would reach its peak oil in the early 1970s. The United States did indeed reach its peak oil in the early 1970s. 

It is unclear as to when the world's peak oil will happen, though most scientists agree that it was reached in the early 2000s or will be reached before 2020. For example, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has said that peak oil may have happened in 2006.

Middlesex

Middlesex is one of the historic counties of England and the second smallest by area. The county once contained the wealthy and politically independent City of London on its southern boundary. The county was affected by the expansion of London in the 18th and 19th centuries. From 1855 the south east was administered as part of London. When county councils were initially introduced in England in 1889 around 20% of the area of Middlesex, and a third of its population, was transferred to the County of London.

In the interwar years urban London further expanded, with the expansion of public transport, and the setting up of new industries outside inner London. 

After a Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London, Middlesex was absorbed by an enlarged Greater London in 1965. Despite its disappearance as an administrative county, Middlesex is still used as an area name. It was kept as a postal county; it is an optional component of postal addresses. It is still regarded by many as a meaningful area, with its own teams in County cricket, rugby and other sports and pastimes.

Recaredo Santos Tornero

Recaredo Santos Tornero (October 14, 1842 – July 26, 1902) was a Chilean editor and journalist. He was the director of "El Mercurio de Valparaíso" and founder of "El Comercio".

Tornero was born in Valparaíso, on October 14, 1842. His parents were Carmen Olmos de Aguilera Orrego, and the Spanish immigrant José Santos Tornero Monteros, who was also the owner of the first public library in Chile. Recaredo Tornero studied at the National Institute of Santiago, and later attended the Ecole Superieure de Commerce de Paris, in France. He came back to Chile in 1860. In 1866, he succeeded his father as the director of "El Mercurio de Valparaíso". He married Elena Stuven Olmos, and they had four children: Carmela, Recaredo, Teresa and Enrique.

His father's businesses included the Spanish Library (), the printing house of "El Mercurio" and the Valparaíso newspaper of the same name. The enterprise remained in the family's possession for 33 years. In 1866, Tornero and his brother Orestes bought the enterprise from their father.

Orestes took care of the library and its other parts, while Recaredo continued running the printing house and the newspaper. Later, they formed the Tornero & Sons Society () with his father, who was living outside Chile.

Tornero was the only editor of "El Mercurio de Valparaíso" from 1867 to 1870. In 1870, he partnered with Camilo Letelier. Blanco Cuartín became the main editor of the newspaper later and suggested that it focus on culture and literacy

He published "Chile Ilustrado" in 1872, the first illustrated album of Chile, with a descriptive guide, historic, politic, industrial, social and statistical review of the country and a rich graphic backup, with more than 200 wood engravings and 10 litographs. He was given a prize for this book at the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition.

After running it for nine years, he sold his part of the newspaper to Camilo Letelier. He revisited Europe in 1875, and bought machinery to create the first paper mill in Chile in 1880. At that time, he also started to publish foreign works translated into Spanish.

After his return to Valparaíso, Tornero founded a library and a printing house in Almendral. His brother Orestes died in 1881, and Tornero he took over the Mercurio library, which was mainly focused on editing teaching material and works translated from French.

President José Manuel Balmaceda had a bad relationship with the Chilean press. For this reason, Recaredo started the newspaper "El Comercio" to support him.

Recaredo died in Santiago on July 26, 1902.

Addictive personality

People who have a personality with many traits that make them prone to addiction are said to have an addictive personality. An addiction is a physical or psychological dependency that influences the life of that person negatively. Very often, such people use illegal drugs, but this does not have to be the case: many can also be addicted to smoking, gambling, food, exercise, work, video games, pornography or relationships. This is called Codependency. People with an addictive personality tend to plan their lives around the addiction. Addictive personality is difficult to treat.

Nexus (professional wrestling)

The Nexus is a professional wrestling stable that compete on the Raw brand. The Nexus' members are the First and Second Season NXT Rookies and CM Punk.

Before the Nexus joined together, they were contestants on the show, NXT. At the end of the first season of the show, Wade Barrett was chosen to be the winner, and he got a WWE contract and a chance to face any champion he chose. The seven losers of the show were left without a job. On the June 7th Raw, the group debuted during a match between John Cena and CM Punk. The Nexus attacked Punk, Cena, Luke Gallows, Jerry Lawler, Matt Striker, and other WWE employees. .
A week later, The Nexus explained their motive for what they did. They said that the WWE didn't treat them good during their time on NXT. Now, they wanted the WWE to give the other 7 members of the Nexus WWE contracts. Bret Hart said no, and he also fired Barrett. The Nexus then attacked Hart, and threw him into a limo. They drove the limo around, crashing into other cars, and hurting Bret Hart. During the Fatal 4-Way pay-per-view, the Nexus interfered in the main event for the WWE Championship, attacking all the wrestlers involved. Sheamus used the interference to win the championship from John Cena.

The next night, Vince McMahon chose a new general manager of Raw. This new GM gave the all of the Nexus WWE contracts. Barrett said that this group was going to form no matter who won the competition, stating that the seven of them had formed a "Nexus" and had a common goal they all fought to have accomplished. However, even after apologizing for their actions, the Nexus continued their attacks, including one on McMahon who tried to take credit for the Nexus' actions.

At Money in the Bank pay-per-view, the Nexus tried to get involved in the WWE Championship match involving Sheamus and John Cena in a steel cage by breaking the door. However, the referees threw away the key and the tool that Tarver tried to use to break in. Then, they tried to climb up and get into the match. However, Sheamus and Cena were able to hold them off and escape, with Sheamus winning. Afterwards, Cena began beating up Tarver and Young and then took Tarver's Nexus armband.

On the July 19 episode of "Raw" the Nexus continued their attacks on the Raw roster by first attacking Edge and then Chris Jericho. Later on in the show Barrett beat Mark Henry. After that, Barrett and The Nexus asked Cena to join them. Cena refused and said that he would take them all down at SummerSlam, and that he had found some help to do it. Cena revealed his team one by one; the members were Edge, John Morrison, R-Truth, The Great Khali, Chris Jericho and Bret Hart. On the August 9 episode of "Raw", the Nexus attacked the Hart Dynasty, Mark Henry, and the Great Khali before being stopped by Team WWE in a tag team lumberjack match. At SummerSlam, the Nexus were defeated by Team WWE, who had Daniel Bryan, who joined Team WWE as a surprise member (after Nexus had (kayfabe) injured Khali, taking him out of the match) and eliminated both Young and Slater. 

On the August 16, 2010 episode of Raw, Wade Barrett said that each member of Nexus would have a match facing a member of Team WWE and if a Nexus member lost they would be kicked out. All members of the Nexus, except for Darren Young, won their matches that night. Because of this, Young was thrown out of Nexus.

This template returns the number of full years and surplus days between two specified dates. If the second set of parameters is not included, it will return the number of full years and surplus days between a specified date and today's date. The two numbers are separated by a comma; the words "year" and "day" are plural when appropriate. The template is included in the year value, so that values produced by this template will work properly in sortable lists. See for more information on using this kind of template.




Note also that due to leap years the measure "years and days" fails to be fully additive. The following example is not an error, but each calculation uses a different definition of "year", either 365 days or 366:

Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)

The Leader of the Opposition in New Zealand is the politician who leads the MPs that are not in government in the New Zealand Parliament. In the debating chamber the Leader of the Opposition sits directly opposite the Prime Minister. At present, the Leader of the Opposition is Phil Goff of Labour.

Usually, the Leader of the Opposition is the leader of the largest party of the Opposition.

The Leader of the Opposition does not have a large official role, but there are several ways in which the Leader of the Opposition takes part in affairs of state. Often, these relate to national security matters, which are supposed to go past party politics - the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service, for example, has to talk to the Leader of the Opposition as well as the Prime Minister about certain matters.

The Leader of the Opposition also receives a higher salary than other members of the Opposition, being paid the same amount as a Cabinet Minister.

Premier of Victoria

The Premier of Victoria is the head of the Government of Victoria, Australia. The Premier does the same job at a state level as the Prime Minister of Australia does at a national level. Formal power is held by the Queen who is represented in Victoria by the Governor of Victoria. The Governor acts on the advice given to him by the Premier. The current Premier of Victoria is Ted Baillieu.

Victoria is governed under the Westminster system of parliamentary government. It is a bicameral system with two elected houses. The lower house is called the Legislative Assembly and the upper house is called the Legislative Council. After an election, the State Governor appoints as Premier, the leader of the party who can control a majority of the elected members in the lower house. The Premier must resign if they no longer have a majority in the Legislative Assembly. This can happen if they lose seats at an election, or if their own political party does not support them.

Victoria was a British colony, and power was held by the Governor. In 1855, Britain allowed Victoria to have its own parliament, and the power was passed to the Premier.

A brief clarification on the thread about Ottava's articles: I followed links to those two pages from Ottava's foundation-l post. I didn't discuss it with him, I just read the articles, enjoyed them, and updated the en:wp articles with them. They were better than the previous best available freely-licensed articles on the topic, and made good use of familiar sources. 

It didn't occur to me that editing in userspace might be seen as suspicious - I assumed that was part of a slow-moving local style guideline for writing/simplifying long pages, which strongly discouraged anything in the main namespace that had not already been rigorously simplified. There is no such policy on en, and so no reason to wait... In the case of The Author's Farce the local simple: process seems to have taken 3-4 months. Was this intentional? Required? is there some other reason why the articles are not in the main article namespace?

I agree with Fr33kman, every one of those articles should make their way into the article namespace on simple. And Djsasso makes a good point that simple should not be seen as a haven for trolls and banned users. -- () 15:57, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

Not been around much recently but flicked onto recent changes and these two diffs jumped out 1 and 2.

I've engaged a couple of contacts within the OTRS system about the possibility of moving our current unblock requests from the mailing list to an otrs queue.

The only difference, is the improved OTRS interface. I want to gather the opinions here to see if we could do this. The technical part is taken care of as of this writing.

University of Melbourne

The University of Melbourne is in Melbourne, Victoria. Opened in 1853, it is the second oldest university in Australia, and the oldest in Victoria. The main campus is in Parkville, just north of the Melbourne CBD. It has several other campuses across Victoria. It has one of the largest financial endowments of any Australian university, standing at $1.105bn as of 2008.

Melbourne is one of the top universities in Australia and the world. In Australia it has a leading position in business, education, engineering, arts, law and medicine. It is the second largest research organisation in Australia after the CSIRO. In 2008, it spent AU$653.7m on research. 

The university has over 35,000 students, and nearly 7,200 staff members. In 2008 it changed the way it organized its courses. This to be like way American and European universities work. The idea was to link to the European Union's Bologna process and get international acceptance for its degrees. many people were unhappy with these changes. Professor Glyn Davis AC is Melbourne's current vice-chancellor.

Melbourne University was started by the Victorian Parliament in 1853. Classes began in 1855 with three professors and 16 students. The buildings were officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor of the Colony of Victoria, Sir Charles Hotham, on 3 October 1855. The first chancellor, Redmond Barry (later Sir Redmond), held the position until his death in 1880. 

At first all the buildings were built in the gothic revival style. In the 1950s a modernist style was started as the new "house style", resulting in the mix of university buildings seen today.

The opening of the university was made possible by the wealth coming from the Victorian gold rush. The university was to be a "civilising influence" at a time of rapid settlement and commercial growth (Selleck, 2003). It was not a religious university and was not allowed to offer in degrees in divinity. The churches could only build colleges on only the northern edge. The local population wanted 'useful' subjects like law, not 'useless' subjects like classics. The people of Melbourne won this argument, and law was introduced in 1857, and medicine and engineering in the 1860s. Women were let into courses in 1881.

In 1902 the university was bankrupt when it was found out that the man in charge of the university's money, Frederick Dickson, had stolen ₤24,000. The university's annual budget was £15,000. Dickson was jailed for seven years. This resulted in a royal commission that came up with new ways of funding, and new courses including agriculture and education. 

After World War II, there were more students wanting to go to a university and Melbourne University became much larger and more inclusive.

The 150th anniversary was celebrated in 2003.

As of 1st July.

During this Tour de France, 3,27 million € are distributed. At the start, each team receives 51 243 €. In return, each team presents in the arrival with at least seven riders obtained a prime of 1 600 € per rider present.


It rewards the overall leader, adding the times achieved on each step. In case of equal time in the general classification, the hundredths of a second recorded by the timekeepers at the time trial "individual" are reintroduced into the total time to separate athletes and decide the attribution of the Yellow jersey.

The points classification is based on the following scale :

The classification of the mountain is based on the following scale :
Points awarded in the climb off-categorized, 1 and 2 categories are doubled when it's the last mountain pass of the stage.

The classification is reserved for young riders born in 1985 or later. The first of them in the general classification is declared leader of the best young rider.

The general team classification is established by adding the three best individual times from each team in all stages. After the last stage, the team credited with the shortest time is declared the winner of the team standings.

The combativity award reward the rider who was the most generous in the effort and showing the best sportsmanship in the stage. After the last stage a Super Competitor is designated by members of the Jury of the Tour de France.

Growth ring

Growth rings are an interesting thing. A growth ring is a ring inside a tree. You can tell how old a tree is by its rings or how old a house is by the wood in the furniture or walls. Counting the growth rings of a tree is a way to tell how old a tree is.
How tree rings are developed

Tree rings grow under the bark, and the bark is pushed out while the tree is growing. The inner part of a growth ring is formed early in the growing season, when growth is fast and is known as early wood. The outer portion is the late wood, and is denser than early wood. Many trees in places with hot summers and cold winters make one growth ring a year.

For the entire life of a tree, a year by year record or ring pattern is formed that reveals the climate conditions in which the tree grew. If a tree grows in a dry place, you can tell its age better than when it grows in a wet place. Switching in between bad and good conditions can result in several rings forming in one year. Tree ring growth patterns are effected by the climate, weather, rain, temperature, soil pH, plant nutrition, CO2 concentration, and sunspots.

Rings happen because of the change in growth speed through winter, spring, summer and fall, so one ring usually marks the passage of one year in the life of the tree. Tree rings are more visible in places where the seasons change between hot and cold. Enough moisture and a long growing season result in a wide ring. A dry year may result in a very narrow ring. Trees from the same area will tend to grow the same pattern of rings. Cut all the way though a tree horizontally, like a stump, to find the growth rings.

Tree growth rings can tell us about the ancient climate and growth rings can be used to tell the age of a tree. Growth rings can also be used to date the wood in old buildings, ships and frames for paintings. Tree rings are used to make radiocarbon dating more accurate.

Some perennial herb species form annual growth rings in their roots (see herbchronology) that basically follow the same principles as growth rings in trees (see dendrochronology).

An ICAO code is the code used by pilots and air traffic controllers to identify airports simply and easily.

The code is made up of four numbers or letters. These are not the same as IATA codes, which are often simpler, and are made to sound like the airport's name. For example, people who fly from Heathrow airport, are likely to know it best as either Heathrow, or by its IATA code: LHR. They are less likely to know its ICAO code: EGLL.

Boston, Massachusetts

Boston is the capital city of Massachusetts in the United States. It was founded in 1630. Boston is one of the oldest, wealthiest and most culturally important cities in the United States.

Boston was founded on November 17, 1630, by Puritan colonists from England. Boston's early European settlers called the area "Trimountaine" (Three Mountains). They renamed the town for Boston, England, in Lincolnshire because many important "Pilgrim" colonists came from there. Most of Boston's early citizens were Puritans. Shortly after Boston's settlement, Puritans created America's first public school and America's first university, Harvard University (1636). Harvard is in the city of Cambridge, which is across the Charles River from Boston. Until the 1760s, Boston was America's largest city.

During the early 1770s, The British tried to control the thirteen colonies with taxes. This made people from Boston start the American Revolution. The Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, and several early battles happened in or near the city. It held its first town meeting in Faneuil Hall in 1743.

Boston continued to grow and attract immigrants from around the world. Many immigrants came from Ireland, and gave Boston a very Irish culture that remains today. President John F. Kennedy was a member of an Irish-American family that lived in Boston. Many immigrants also came from Italy, and lived in Boston's North End.

The tallest towers in Boston are the Prudential Tower and the John Hancock Tower.

Boston has a culture that's quite similar to New England, such as a New England accent and foods that are mostly seafood, salt, and dairy products. Irish Americans are very important in Boston's politics and religious activities. Boston people also have a style of talking which is called Boston slang.

It is often thought that Bostonians have a strong sense of culture. Perhaps this is because Boston is famous for being a very intellectual place, with much of its culture coming from its universities. The city has many complex theatres, including the Cutler Majestic Theatre, Boston Opera House, Citi Performing Arts Center, the Colonial Theater, and the Orpheum Theatre.

Boston is one of the United States' most important cities in education and health care. Boston and the towns around it contain many of the country's leading universities. Harvard, MIT, and Boston University are some of the most famous.

Professional sports are an important part of life in Boston. The Red Sox play baseball at Fenway Park, the oldest stadium in Major League Baseball (1912). The Celtics, a basketball team, and the Bruins, a hockey team, both play at the TD Garden. Boston's football team, the New England Patriots, play in Foxborough, a town 22 miles south of the city.

Parti Québécois

The Parti Québécois (PQ) is a political party that wants sovereignty for the province of Quebec. The Parti Québécois want Quebec to become its own country, or succeed from Canada.
The Parti Québécois, or PQ was founded by René Lévesque. PQ's main goals are to get independence for Québec. In the provincial election of 1976, the Parti Québécois was elected to the government of Québec for the first time and René Lévesque, became the premier of Quebec. Many French people in Québec were happy to see the Lévesque as premier, while many English people were not happy..

The PQ passed a bill called Bill 101. This bill is a law that makes French the languages used most in Quebec, even though English and French are the languages spoken in Canada.. The party was elected again in the 1981 election, but in November 1984 founder René Lévesque left the party and the PQ lost the 1985 election.

The Parti Québécois started the first Quebec referendum, having the citizens vote to decided to either leave Canada or stay a part of the country. 60 per cent of the people who voted decided to stay in Canada. The PQ had a second referendum in 1995. The citizens once again voted to stay in Canada. The leader of the part, acques Parizeau quit after the referendum failed.

The current Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe was the first to announce that he would to try to become the leader of the PQ, on May 11, 2007.Pauline Marois also said she was going to try to become leader, but Duceppe changed his mind on the 12th leaving Marois the only candidate. On June 26, 2007 Marois won the leadership. Pauline Marois is the current leader of the. She has said that the PQ plans to have another referendum in the future. 

The Bloc Québécois is a federal political party in Canada that was made in in 1990 by future PQ leader Lucien Bouchard. The Bloc also wants sovereignty for Québec. The two parties help each other during elections.

Wheel gymnastics

Wheel gymnastics is a form of gymnastics which originated in Germany. 

Wheel gymnasts do exercises in a large wheel known as the "Rhönrad", "gymnastics wheel", "gym wheel", or "German wheel".

There are three main categories of exercise in wheel gymnasts. They are: "straight line", "spiral", and "vault".

While being a child, Otto Feick, the son of a blacksmith from Reichenbach, Germany, used to roll down a hill in two wagon tires which inspired him later to invent the wheel gymnastics between 1920-1922. The current wheel gymnastics obtained its final shape in 1974 with the introduction of the PVC coating . Now, it's a competitive sport practiced in Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Japan, and United States of America .

Trampolining

Trampolining is a competitive Olympic sport in which gymnasts perform airborne acrobatics while bouncing on a trampoline. These can include simple jumps in the "pike", "tuck" or "straddle position" to more complex combinations of forward or backward somersaults and twists .

There are two related competitive rebound sports: "synchronized trampoline" and "double mini-trampoline".
The currently accepted basic format for individual trampoline competitions usually consists of two or three "routines", one of which may involve a compulsory set of skills. The skills consist of various combinations of somersaults, shaped bounces, body landings and twists performed in various body positions .

In the early 1930s, an American gymnast George Nissen observed "trapeze" artistes performing tricks when bouncing off the "safety net". He made the first modern trampoline in his garage to reproduce that net on a smaller scale and used it to help with his diving and tumbling activities. It was the beginning of a new sport.

In the USA, trampolining was quickly introduced into school physical education programs and was also used in private entertainment centers. Since trampolining became an Olympic sport in 2000, many countries have started developing programs for producing very competitive athletes.

Priapulida

Priapulida (priapulid or penis worms) are a phylum of marine worms. Their name refers to their extensible spiny proboscis, which, in some species, may have a shape similar to that of a human penis. They live in the mud, which they eat, in comparatively shallow waters up to .

Their nearest relatives are probably Kinorhyncha and Loricifera with which they constitute the taxon Scalidophora. Besides arthropods and velvet worms, the priapulids are the only members of the Ecdysozoa which are relatively large in size. They feed on slow-moving invertebrates, such as polychaete worms.

Priapulid fossils are known at least as far back as the Middle Cambrian.. They were probably major predators of the Cambrian period. There are only sixteen known living species of priapulid worms.


</doc>
<doc id="253140" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=253140" title="Kinorhyncha">
Kinorhyncha

Kinorhyncha is a phylum of small (1 mm or less) marine invertebrates. They are widespread in mud or sand at all depths of the sea. They are also called mud dragons. About 150 species are known. Kinorhynchs eat either diatoms or organic material found in the mud, depending on species. 

Kinorhynchans are segmented, limbless animals, with a body consisting of a head, neck, and a trunk of eleven segments. Unlike some similar invertebrates, they do not have external cilia, but instead have a number of spines along the body, plus up to seven circles of spines around the head. These spines are used for movement, withdrawing the head and pushing forward, then gripping the substrate with the spines while drawing up the body. 

The body wall consists of a thin layer, which secretes a tough cuticle; this is molted several times while growing to adulthood. This layer is a syncytium, containing nuclei, but no cell membranes.

The spines are moveable extensions of the body wall, and are hollow and covered by cuticle. The head is completely retractable, and is covered by a set of neck plates called "placids" when retracted.

The nervous system is typical for invertebrates. It consists of a ventral nerve cord, with one ganglion in each segment, and an anterior nerve ring surrounding the pharynx. Smaller ganglia are also located in the lateral and dorsal portions of each segment, but do not form distinct cords. Some species have simple ocelli (eye-spots) on the head, and all species have tiny bristles on the body to provide a sense of touch.

There are two sexes that look alike. A pair of gonads are located in the mid-region of the trunk, and open to pores in the final segment. In most species, the sperm duct includes two or three spiny structures that presumably aid in copulation, although the details are unknown. The larvae are free-living, but little else is known of their reproductive process.

Their closest relatives are thought to be the phyla Loricifera and Priapulida. Together they constitute the Scalidophora.

<doc id="253146" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=253146" title="Loricifera">
Loricifera

Loricifera is a recently discovered phylum of marine animals. The phylum includes the first animals known to exist in a completely anoxic environment (no oxygen at all). The phylum was described in 1983 by Reinhardt Kristensen. 

They are a phylum of very small animals which live in sediment. There are now twenty-two described species, in eight genera. In addition, there are about 100 more species which have been collected, but not yet described. Their size ranges from 100µm to about 1 mm. 

Their habitat is in the spaces between marine gravel to which they attach themselves. They are among the most recently discovered groups of Metazoans. They attach themselves quite firmly to the gravel, and this explains why they remained undiscovered for so long. The first specimen was collected in the 1970s, and later described in 1983. They are found at all depths of water, in different sediment types, and in all latitudes. They have not yet been found in the fossil record.

These animals have a protective outer case called a lorica. Protected by the lorica, the animals have a head, mouth and digestive system. Development is usually direct, though there are larvae in some species. The animals have two sexes as adults. There are some complex and flexible life cycles with different forms of parthenogenetic reproduction. 

Their closest relatives are thought to be the Kinorhyncha and Priapulida, with whom they share some characteristics. Together they make up the super-phylum Scalidophora.

Three species of Loricifera have been found in the sediments at the bottom of the L'Atalante basin in the Mediterranean Sea. The 'surface' of this basin is 3,500 meters down. They are the first multicellular organisms known to spend their entire lives in an oxygen-free environment. It is thought they are able to do this because they rely on organelles which, unlike normal mitochondria, do not use oxygen for their energy cycle.

The newly reported animals complete their life cycle in the total absence of light and oxygen, and they are less than a millimetre in size. They were collected from the deep basin where they live in a nearly salt-saturated brine. This brine, because of its density, does not mix with the waters above. As a result, the brine is completely anoxic, and high in ammonia. Also, due to the action of sulphate reducers, it contains sulphide at a high concentration. In the brine, the abundance of cells is not high. Extremophiles predominate, including members of the deep-sea hydrothermal vent community of archaea and bacteria. Eukaryotes are also found in l'Atalante, including ciliates (45%), dinoflagellates (21%) and choanoflagellata (10%).

Saturation (chemistry)

The most common use of the term saturation in chemistry is:

Saturation is the point at which a solution of a substance can dissolve no more of that substance, and additional amounts of it will appear as a solid precipitate. 

This point of maximum concentration, the saturation point, depends on the temperature of the liquid as well as the chemical nature of the substances involved. If a change in conditions (e.g. cooling) means that the concentration is actually higher than the saturation point, the solution has become "supersaturated".

<doc id="253175" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=253175" title="L'Atalante basin">
L'Atalante basin

The L'Atalante basin is a very salty 'lake' at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.

It is about 190 km (~120 miles) west of the island of Crete. It is called a 'lake' because, though it is under more than two miles of water, it is almost completely separate from the sea above it. Its huge salt content prevents the waters mixing. Sometimes these lakes are called "brine pools". They are found in many oceans; there is one in the Gulf of Mexico.

L'Atalante is only one of several such lakes underneath the normal waters of the Mediterranean. When the Strait of Gibraltar was closed, about six million years ago, the Mediterranean dried up and became a huge salt lake, rather like the Dead Sea and the Great Salt Lake are today. Then it dried out completely, leaving an enormous amount of salt. When the Straight of Gibraltar opened again about five million years ago, water from the Atlantic Ocean rushed in to form the Mediterranean we see today. Even today, the Atlantic feeds the Mediterranean with water, because the evaporation from the 'Med' is greater than is provided by its rivers. With its huge supply of salt underneath, and the constant evaporation, the Med is a high salt sea compared with the Atlantic. 

The L'Atalanta lake and its neighbours the Urania and Discovery lakes are about 35,000 years old. They were formed by salt deposits dissolving out of the Mediterranean Ridge and collecting in deep depressions at the bottom of the Med. L'Atalante is the smallest of the three. Its surface begins at about below sea level.

L'Atalante's salinity (salt content) is near saturation, at 36.5%, about eight times more than seawater. This prevents the water in the brine pool from mixing with the 'normal' seawater above. Without mixing, oxygen from above can't get into the brine pool. The basin's water is completely anoxic: it has no oxygen. 

Between the normal water and the brine is a short (1.5 metres) boundary zone called a halocline. The salt content rises sharply there, and oxygen reduces towards zero. This halocline between the seawater above and the brine below has many bacterial and archaeal cells: they are chemoautotrophs, which feed on ammonia from the brine but cannot function without some oxygen. Certain methane oxidizers and haloarchaea are found only in the halocline.

Below, in the brine, the number of cells is much lower than in the halocline. Extremophiles are most common, including some of the deep-sea hydrothermal vent archaea and bacteria. Eukaryotes are also found in l'Atalante, mostly ciliates (45%), dinoflagellates (21%) and choanoflagellata (10%). 

The dark grey anoxic sediments at the bottom of L'Atalante lake are covered with a loose black layer. Microbes found in the sediments are almost all (90%) various species of "Bacillus". In 2010, three metazoan species, all in the Loricifera phylum, were discovered living in the sediment, the first multicellular lifeforms known to live entirely without oxygen.

Tactical voting

Tactical voting happens when a person votes for someone other than their favorite candidate in a way to either help their favorite or achieve some other goal. This may happen in national or local elections, or even in elections for clubs and homeowner associations.

Say 5 people are running as candidates for board members, but only 3 will be elected. For the following situations except the last, let's say you get 1 vote.





Another common situation happens in primary elections, where members of one party may temporarily 'cross over' to the other party to support a candidate who is getting less votes, hoping their favorite will face weak competition in the main election. This type of negative voting is popular but often considered unethical.

Many experts question tactical voting in that it can undermine a democratic outcome. That is, ethical voters may believe it more important how a candidate wins than who wins. Others feel the end justifies the means. Most researchers tend to frown on tactical voting.

<doc id="253245" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=253245" title="Alternative country">
Alternative country

Alternative country (sometimes called alt-country, or Americana) is a type of country music. It has singers or bands that sound very different mainstream or pop country music. "Alternative country" has been used to describe country music bands and artists that have influences such as roots rock, bluegrass, rockabilly, Americana, honky-tonk, alternative rock, folk rock, or punk.

In the 1990s the term "alternative country" (which is like the term alternative rock, which was becoming popular at the same time), began to be used to talk about different groups of musicians and singers who did not follow the same traditions of regular country music, and who had a different sound. Many of them did not follow the high production values (such as spending a lot of money in the recording studio) of the big country music industry at the time, which was mostly based in Nashville, Tennessee. 

Lyrics in alternative country might be depressing or about social issues, and often from the heart. They do not follow the clichés sometimes used by mainstream country musicians as often. In other ways, the sounds of alternative country artists do not always have much in common. They can include traditional American folk tunes, bluegrass, and other types of sounds. It can be music that does not sound like mainstream rock or country. This has become even more confusing with "alternative country artists" saying that they do not want to be called alternative country, with more mainstream artists saying they are alternative country, and with people saying that older musicians or musicians from the past are alternative country. "No Depression", the most popular magazine about alternative country, said that it covered "alternative-country music (whatever that is)". 
Even though not everybody agrees on what makes music "alternative country", most people agree that alternative country came from traditional American country music. 

In the 1980s, in southern California, some musicians tried to make some music that had parts of country and parts of punk. This was called the "cowpunk scene". It had bands like Jason and the Scorchers. These styles came together in Uncle Tupelo's popular album "No Depression", which came out in 1990. Many people think it was the first alternative country album. A magazine called "No Depression" later came out that was written about alternative country. The magazine was named after Uncle Tupelo's album. The band made three more important albums and joined a big record label. The band broke up in 1994. Musicians in the band and people around the band later started three other important alternative country bands: Wilco, Son Volt and Bottle Rockets. Bottle Rockets signed, along with acts like Freakwater, The Old 97's and Robbie Fulks, to the Chicago-based indie record label, Bloodshot. They played a type of alternative country called "insurgent country". The bands Blue Mountain, Whiskeytown, Blood Oranges and Drive-By Truckers kept going in this direction before most began to move more in the direction of rock music in the 2000s.

Constitution of Australia

The Constitution of Australia is the laws that set up the Australian Commonwealth Government and the way it works. It is made up of several documents. The most important is the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. The people of Australia voted in referendums from 1898–1900 to accept the Constitution. The Constitution was then passed as a part of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (Imp), an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
Queen Victoria signed it on 9 July 1900. The Constitution became law on 1 January 1901. Even though the Constitution was an Act of the United Kingdom parliament, the Australia Acts took away the power of the United Kingdom parliament to change the Constitution. Now only the Australian people can change it by referendum.

Two other laws support the Australian Constitution. The first is the Statute of Westminster, as passed by the Commonwealth as the "Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942." The second is the "Australia Act 1986", which was passed by the Parliaments of every Australian state, the United Kingdom, and the Australian Federal Parliament. Together, these Acts had the effect of cutting all constitutional links between Australia and the United Kingdom. Even though the same person, Queen Elizabeth II, is the monarch of both countries, these are now separate countries.

Under Australia's common law system, the High Court of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia have the power to decide what the constitution actually means..

The history of the Constitution of Australia began with moves towards federation in the 19th century. This led to the Australian colonies joining together to form the Commonwealth of Australian 1901. 

In the mid-19th century, the Australian colonies needed to work together on things that affected them all, especially tariffs between the colonies. This cooperation led to plans to join the colonies together in a single federation. The push to do this was mainly coming from Britain and there was little local support. The smaller colonies thought they would be taken over by the larger ones. Victoria and New South Wales did not agree about the need to protect local industry as opposed to allowing everyone to trade freely. The then-recent American Civil War also weakened the case for federalism. These difficulties led to the failure of several attempts to bring about federation in the 1850s and 1860s.

By the 1880s Australians were worried about the growing presence of the Germans and the French in the Pacific. Along with a growing Australian identity, this created the opportunity to start the first inter-colonial body, the Federal Council of Australasia, in 1885. This Federal Council could make laws on certain subjects, but did not have a permanent office, an executive, or its own source of income. New South Wales, the largest colony, would not take part.

Henry Parkes, the Premier of New South Wales, pushed for a series of conferences in the 1890s to talk about federalism. The first one was in Melbourne in 1890, and another, the National Australasian Convention, in Sydney in 1891. These were attended by colonial leaders. By the 1891 conference, many people wanted a federal system. Most of the discussion was about how this federal system would work. With help from Sir Samuel Griffith, a draft constitution was written. These meetings did not have popular support. The draft constitution also left out important, but difficult, issues, such as tariff policy. The draft of 1891 was given to colonial parliaments but was not supported by New South Wales. Without NSW, the other colonies were unwilling to continue.

In 1895, the six premiers of the Australian colonies agreed to set up a new Convention by popular vote. The Convention met over the course of a year from 1897 to 1898. The meetings produced a new Constitution that was the same as the 1891 draft, but with added provisions for responsible government. To get popular support, the draft was voted on by the electors of each colony. After one failed attempt, a changed draft was given to the electors of each colony except Western Australia. Five colonies passed the Bill that was then sent to the Westminster Parliament with a letter requesting the Queen to make it into law.

The British government made one change before the Bill was passed. The Chief Justices of the colonies wanted the right to appeal decisions of the High Court to the Privy Council on constitutional matters. They were worried that the limits of the powers of the Commonwealth or States could be changed by parliament. The British Parliament passed the "Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act" in 1900. Western Australia finally agreed to join the Commonwealth in time for it to join the Commonwealth of Australia, which officially began on 1 January 1901.

In 1990, the Public Records Office in London loaned the original copy 1900 of the "Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act" to Australia. The Australian government wanted to keep the copy. The British parliament agreed by passing the "Australian Constitution (Public Record Copy) Act 1990".

Although Federation made Australia independent of Britain, legally the Commonwealth was a creation of the British Imperial Parliament, through the "Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act" 1900 (Imp), which applied to Australia. As a result, there was continued uncertainty as to whether British Imperial laws still applied to the Commonwealth. This was fixed by the "Statute of Westminster 1931", adopted by the Commonwealth via the "Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942". The Statute of Westminster freed the Dominions, including the Commonwealth, from Imperial laws and controls. Legally, this is the moment of Australia's national independence.

However, British laws were still more important in Australian states. This was fixed by the "Australia Act 1986", which was passed by the parliaments of Australia, the United Kingdom, and each of the states. This law stopped the British Parliament's power to make laws over Australian states. It also stopped appeals from the Australian courts to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. As this was a very important document, Queen Elizabeth II travelled to Australia to sign the proclamation of the law.

One result of these two laws is that Australia is now a fully independent country. The Constitution is now different from the original Act, as the Australian people can change the Constitution, by referendum. However, the original Act remains on the UK's law book with a note saying, "The Constitution is not necessarily in the form in which it is in force in Australia". Even if the United Kingdom Parliament were to remove the "Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900", it would have no effect on Australia.

The "Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900" (Imp) contains a Preamble, and nine sections. Sections 1 8 are explain the laws to set up the Commonwealth. Section 9, starting with the words "The Constitution of the Commonwealth shall be as follows ...", contains the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. The Constitution itself is in eight chapters, with 128 sections.

Chapter I sets up the Parliament of Australia. This has three parts: 

Section 1 says that legislative power belongs to the Parliament. It is the most powerful part of government.

Part II of Chapter 1 is about the Senate. Senators are to be "directly chosen by the people of the State", voting as a single electorate. Each State is to have the same number of senators. Currently, there are 12 senators for each State, and 2 each for the mainland territories, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.

Part III of Chapter 1 is about the House of Representatives. Section 24 says the House must have twice as many members as the Senate, each elected by a single electorate. This is called the 'Nexus'. It designed to prevent swamping of the senate's power in the case of a joint sitting (see Section 57 below). The number of electorates in a State is to be based on its share of the national population.

Part IV of Chapter 1 says who can vote, who can be elected to the parliament, how much members can be paid, parliamentary rules and related matters.

Part V of Chapter 1 is about the powers of the parliament. Section 51 deals with powers of the Commonwealth parliament and are called "specific powers". There are "concurrent powers", as both the Commonwealth and States can make laws on these subjects. Federal law is more important if the laws are different (Section 109). Of the thirty-nine parts of section 51, a few have become very important in deciding how much power the Commonwealth government has in law. These include the Trade and Commerce Power, the Corporations Power and the External Affairs Power. Section 52 deals with powers that belong only to the Commonwealth parliament. States cannot make laws on these subjects.

Chapter II sets up the executive branch of government. Executive power is to be exercised by the Governor-General, advised by the Federal Executive Council. The Governor-General is the commander in chief. He or she may appoint and dismiss the members of the Executive Council, ministers of state, and all officers of the executive government. These powers, along with the powers to dissolve (or refuse to dissolve) parliament (Section 5, Section 57), are termed "reserve powers". The use of these powers is by convention. Generally, the Governor-General acts only on the advice of the Prime Minister. There has been only one instance of the Governor-General not taking the Prime Minister's advice. Governor-General Sir John Kerr, acting on his own, dismissed Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis.

Reserve powers in all Westminster nations are only "extremely" rarely exercised outside of the understood conventions. However, in contrast with the constitutions of other Commonwealth Realms such as Canada which formally grant extensive reserve powers to the Monarch, even the formal powers of the Queen of Australia are extremely limited, and most powers can only be used by the Governor-General. 
Section 68 says that the Command in chief of Australia's naval and military forces as being: "The command in chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the Governor General as the Queen's representative". The Commander in chief of the Australian Defence Force is now Her Excellency Quentin Bryce as the Governor General of Australia. The Queen of Australia is not in command of the military.

Chapter III sets up the judicial branch of government. Section 71 gives judicial power in a "Federal Supreme Court" to be called the High Court of Australia. The Parliament can also make new federal courts or give other courts federal powers. Such courts are called "Chapter III Courts" are the only courts that can use federal judicial power. Sections 73 and 75-78 outline the original and appellate jurisdiction of the High Court. Section 74 explains how an appeal can be made to the Queen in Council. Section 79 allows Parliament to limit the number of judges able to exercise federal jurisdiction and section 80 guarantees trial by jury for indictable offences against the Commonwealth.

Chapter IV deals with finance and trade in the federal system. Section 81 says that all Commonwealth revenue shall form the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Parliament can make laws as to the how its money is spent (Section 53). Unlike most other powers of the parliament, laws made under this power cannot usually be challenged. Section 90 gives the Commonwealth exclusive power over duties of custom and excise.

Section 92 provides that "trade, commerce, and intercourse among the States shall be "absolutely free"". The precise meaning of this phrase is the subject of a considerable body of law.

Section 96 gives the Commonwealth power to give money to States "on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit". This power is not limited by any other part of the Constitution, such as Section 99 that forbids giving preference to one State or over another State. It is subject only to Section 116, freedom of religion, and possibly other such freedoms. This power, which was only meant to be used ("during a period of ten years ... and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides"), has been used by the Commonwealth to encourage cooperation by the States to various extents over the years.

Section 101 sets up an Inter-State Commission, a body which is no longer exists, but which was meant to have a significant role in the federal structure.

Chapter V sets out how what the States can do in a federal system. Sections 106-108 preserves the Constitution, powers of the Parliament, and the laws in force of each of the States.

Section 109 says that, where a State law is different to a federal law, the federal law is the legal law.

Section 111 says that a State can give up any part of its lands to the Commonwealth. This has happened several times. South Australia gave the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth.

Section 114 stops any state from having its own military force. It also stops the State or the Commonwealth from taxing each other's property.

Section 116 sets out "freedom of religion", by stopping "the Commonwealth" from making any law to start a religion, imposing any religious observance, or stop a religion, or religious discrimination for public office.

Chapter VI allows new states to be made, or to join the Commonwealth. Section 122 allows the Parliament to provide for the representation in Parliament of any new territory. Section 123 says that changing the boundaries of a State needs the support of the Parliament of that State and must pass a referendum in that State.

No new states have joined the Commonwealth since federation.

Chapter VII says that the seat of government of the Commonwealth (now Canberra) shall be in New South Wales but no less than one hundred miles from Sydney, and that the Governor-General may appoint deputies. Section 127 first said that Aborigines cannot be counted in any Commonwealth or State census. This section was changed in 1967.

Chapter VIII sets out how the Constitution can be changed. Section 128 says that changes must be approved by a referendum. A successful change needs:

The Governor-General must put the referendum bill to the people between two and six months after passing parliament. After the constitutional amendment bill has passed both the parliament and the referendum, it then receives Royal Assent from the Governor-General. This makes it the new law and the wording of the Constitution will be changed.

An exception to this process is if the amendment bill is rejected by one house of Federal Parliament. If the bill passes the first house and is rejected by the second, then after three months the first house may pass it again. If the bill is still rejected by the second house, then the Governor-General may choose to still put the bill to the people's vote.

As mentioned above, changing the Constitution requires a referendum in which the "Yes" vote achieves a majority nationally, as well as majorities in a majority of states.

Forty-four proposals to change the Constitution have been voted on at referendums. Eight have been approved. The following is a list of changes that have been approved. 


As well as the written Constitution, and Letters Patent issued by the Crown, conventions are an important part of the Constitution. These have developed over the years and define how various constitutional mechanisms work in practice.

Conventions play a powerful role in the operation of the Australian constitution because of its set-up and operation as a Westminster system of responsible government. Some important conventions include:

However, because conventions are not written down, their existence and practice are open to debate. Real or alleged violation of convention has often led to political controversy. One extreme case was the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975, in which the operation of conventions was seriously tested. The ensuing constitutional crisis was resolved dramatically when the Governor-General Sir John Kerr dismissed the Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, appointing Malcolm Fraser as caretaker Prime Minister pending the 1975 general election. A number of conventions were said to be broken during this episode. These include:

In line with the common law tradition in Australia, the law on the interpretation and application of the Constitution has developed largely through judgments by the High Court of Australia in various cases. In a number of seminal cases, the High Court has developed several doctrines which underlie the interpretation of the Australian Constitution. Some examples include:

The vast majority of constitutional cases before the High Court deal with characterisation: whether new laws are part of the power granted to the Commonwealth government by the Constitution.

The Australian Constitution does not include a Bill of Rights. Some people at the 1898 Constitutional Convention wanted a Bill of Rights like the United States Constitution, but the majority felt that the traditional rights and freedoms of British subjects were enough. These would be protected by the Parliamentary system and independent judiciary which the Constitution would create. As a result, the Australian Constitution has often been criticised for not protecting rights and freedoms.

Some rights were included:

In 1992 and 1994, the High Court of Australia found that the Constitution gave an "implied" right to freedom of political communication, in a series of cases including the "Australian Capital Television" case and the "Theophanous" case. This was seen as a necessary part of the democratic system created by the Constitution. The application of this "implied right" has, however, been restricted in later cases, such as "Lange v ABC". It is in no way equivalent to a freedom of speech, and only protects individuals against the government trying to limit their political communication: it offers no protection against other individuals.

In 2007, the High Court of Australia in "Roach v Electoral Commissioner" said that sections 7 and 24 of the Constitution, by providing that members of the House of Representatives and the Senate be "directly chosen by the people", created a limited right to vote. This means that there is a universal franchise in principle, and limited the Federal Parliament's legislative power to change it. In the case, a legislative change to stop all prisoners from voting (as opposed to only those serving sentences of three years or more, as it was before the amendment) was rejected as breaking that right.

Other attempts to find other "implied rights" in High Court cases have not been successful.

While a "pro forma" preamble prefaces the Imperial "Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900", the Australian Constitution itself does not have a preamble. There have been some calls to add one to express the spirit and aspirations embodied in the constitution. However, there has been fierce opposition, usually on the basis of the content of the preamble, as well as possible legal ramifications of this text. In 1999, a proposed preamble, written by John Howard, the then Prime Minister, was defeated in a referendum held concurrently with the Republic referendum. The "Yes" vote (in favour of the insertion of the preamble) did not achieve a majority in any of the six states.

There have been many people who have wanted Australia to become a republic. On 6 November 1999, Australians did not support a law to remove the Queen and replace the Governor-General with a President. The President was to be appointed by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth Parliament. Opinion poll results said that the majority of Australians are in favour of some form of a republic. Many voters who voted against the 1999 referendum wanted to be able to vote for a President. In research and polling following the 1999 referendum, people said that an appointed President would not be able to act independently of the Parliament. By being able to appoint the President, rather than having the people elect a President, many felt that too much power was being given to Parliament with no check or balance on that power. Support for holding another referendum in the near future seems to be growing, and another referendum may be held. Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the current situation "no longer reflects either the fundamental democratic principles that underpin the Australian nation or its diversity", . He was thinking about a referendum for an independent, elected President. He went on to say that "over the next year there would be an "accelerated public debate" about the monarchy question".

Constitution Day is celebrated on 9 July, the date the Constitution became law in 1900. The date is not a public holiday. Constitution Day was first held on 9 July 2000 to mark the centenary of the Constitution as part of the Centenary of Federation. The celebrations were not big and have not been widely held after 2001. Constitution Day was revived in 2007 and is jointly organised by the National Archives of Australia, which holds the original Constitution documents, and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship.

Wildlife management

Wildlife management is a general term for the process of keeping wild species at desirable levels as determined by wildlife managers. Wildlife management can include game keeping, wildlife conservation and pest control. Wildlife management has become an integrated science using disciplines such as mathematics, chemistry, biology, ecology, climatology and geography to gain the best results.

Wildlife conservation aims to halt the loss of species. It does this by taking using ecological principles to balance the needs of wildlife with the needs of people. Most wildlife is concerned with the preservation and improvement of habitats. Techniques can include reforestation, pest control, irrigation, coppicing and hedge laying.

Game keeping is the management or control of wildlife for the wellbeing of game birds. It may include killing other animals which share the same niche or predators to maintain a high population of the more profitable species, such as pheasants introduced into woodland. In his 1933 book "Game Management", Aldo Leopold, one of the pioneers of wildlife management as a science, defined it as "the art of making land produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use".

Food poisoning

Food poisoning is when someone gets sick from eating food or drink that has gone bad or is contaminated.
There are two kinds of food poisoning: poisoning by toxic agent or by infectious agent. Food infection is when the food contains bacteria or other microbes which infect the body after it is eaten. Food intoxication is when the food contains toxins, including bacterially produced exotoxins, which can happen even when the microbe that produced the toxin is no longer present or able to cause infection. Even though it is commonly called "food poisoning", most cases are caused by a variety of pathogenic bacteria, viruses, prions or parasites that contaminate food, rather than chemical or natural toxins which are what we usually call poison. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 76 million people in the United States become ill from the food they eat, and about 5,000 of them die every year.

Symptoms start many hours to many days after eating. Depending on what the cause of the poisoning was, they can include one or more of the following: nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, fever, pain in the head or fatigue.

In most cases the body is able to permanently get better after a short period of acute discomfort and illness. Foodborne illnesses can result in permanent health problems or even death, especially for people at high risk, including babies, young children, pregnant women (and their fetuses), elderly people, sick people and others with weak immune systems.

Foodborne illness due to campylobacter, yersinia, salmonella or shigella infection is a major cause of reactive arthritis, which typically occurs 1–3 weeks after diarrheal illness. Similarly, people with liver disease are especially susceptible to infections from Vibrio vulnificus, which can be found in oysters or crabs.

Tetrodotoxin poisoning from reef fish and other animals shows up very quickly in symptoms such as numbness and shortness of breath, and is often fatal.

Rungrado May Day Stadium

The Rŭngrado May First Stadium, or May Day Stadium, is a multi-purpose stadium in Pyongyang, North Korea, completed on May 1, 1989.

The stadium was built as a main stadium for the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students in 1989.
It is currently used for football matches, a few athletics matches, but most often for Arirang performances (also known as the Mass Games). The stadium can seat 150,000, which is the largest stadium in the world that is not used for auto racing.

Its name comes from the place where it is, Rungra Islet in the Taedong River, and May Day, the international day celebrating labour.

The stadium is most famous for being the place where large shows celebrating Kim Il-sung and the North Korean nation were held. In June-July 2002, the "Arirang" gymnastic and artistic performances were held there. There were 100,000+ people taking part —double the number of people watching— and was open to foreigners, which is rare. These performances now happen every year, usually in August and September. The "Guinness Book of Records" has recognized these events as the largest in the world.

In 2000, Kim Jong-Il used the stadium to entertain Madeleine Albright, the U.S. Secretary of State under President Bill Clinton.

Badwater Basin

Badwater Basin is a basin in Death Valley National Park, Death Valley, California. The water which goes into it does not flow into any ocean. 

Badwater Basin is the lowest point in North America, at below sea level. Mount Whitney, the highest point in the 48 states, is only 76 miles west of the Basin.

Badwater Basin has a small natural pool of undrinkable water next to the road. The water comes from a spring. It is called 'Badwater' because people cannot drink the water. This is because so much salt has built up from the basin. The pool does have animals and plants living there, including pickleweed, insects, and the Badwater snail.

The pool is not actually the lowest point of the basin. The lowest point is several miles to the west, the exact point which is lowest changes. However, the salt flats are dangerous to travel across (in many cases being only a thin white crust over mud), therefore the sign states that the lowest point is at the pool, where people can see it. Some people say that it is the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere, but this is not true. The lowest point is actually Laguna del Carbón in Argentina at −105 meters (−344 feet).

At Badwater Basin, big rainstorms sometimes flood the bottom of the valley. They cover the salt pan with a thin sheet of standing water. This makes new lakes, but the lakes do not last long. This is because the average of rain that falls every year is much lower than the a 150-inch annual evaporation rate, so all the water evaporates away. This means that even a 12-foot-deep, 30-mile-long lake would dry up in a single year. While the basin is flooded, some of the salt dissolves and goes back into the basin as clean crystals when the water evaporates.

Painted on the cliff above Badwater is a sign that says "Sea Level" which people visiting like to look at.

During the Holocene, when the regional climate was less dry, streams that ran from mountains in the area slowly filled Death Valley until it was 3 feet (1m) deep. Eventually, there was a long lake, Lake Manly.

The wet times with much rain did not last. The temperature got warmer, and there was less rain. The lake began to dry up, and as the water evaporated, the lake became saltier. Eventually, only a soup of brine was left. Salts (95% table salt: NaCl) began to turn into crystals, covering the surface with a thick crust from three inches to five feet thick (1-1.7m).

Bush Doctrine

The Bush Doctrine is a term which many people use to describe several foreign policy and national defense decisions that President George W. Bush made.

The Bush Doctrine is usually used to describe how Bush invaded Iraq in what is known as pre-emptive war (which means to attack the enemy before they can attack you).

George W. Bush did not make up this term and he never said what he thought about the term.

There are other United States presidential doctrines also.

Truman Doctrine

A speech was made by American President Harry S. Truman to the U.S. Congress on 12 March 1947. In this speech he said he thinks that The United States should help Greece and Turkey to stop them being 'Totalitarianists' although he meant Soviet Communism. This became known as the Truman Doctrine. Some Historians believe that this was the start of the Cold War. 
This speech was made after The United Kingdom said that they would stop helping Greece and Turkey in February 1947 since The United Kingdom was also poor after the cost of World War II. This meant that Greece and Turkey would still be poor and Truman believed that a poor Eastern Europe would be Communist more easily unless helped by The United States.Truman wrongly thought that the Soviets were helping the Greek Communist partisans when there were no clear proof. 
This plan was a big change to American politics. Political historian Walter LaFeber wrote that 'the doctrine became an ideological shield' which means that he believed that The United States used the doctrine as an excuse or reason. The Marshall Plan came after because this.

God Defend New Zealand

"God Defend New Zealand" is one of the national anthems of New Zealand. The other national anthem is "God Save the Queen", but that is not sung very often. Most people in New Zealand call "God Defend New Zealand" ""the" national anthem".

The words were written by Thomas Bracken in the 1870s. On 1 July 1876, the poem appeared in a local newspaper as part of a competition. The competition was to see who could compose the best music to fit the words. The prize was ten guineas. Twelve entries were received, and the winner was a young teacher named John Joseph Woods. It was first performed on Christmas Day, 1876, in Dunedin's Queen's Theatre.

100 years later, 7750 people signed a petition to make "God Defend New Zealand" the national anthem of New Zealand. After this was presented to Parliament, Queen Elizabeth II gave permission for it to become New Zealand's second national anthem, equal to "God Save the Queen".

Usually, only the first verse of the English and the Māori versions are sung, with the Māori first. The Māori version is not a translation of the English version, but was written to fit the melody.

<doc id="253569" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=253569" title="John Joseph Woods">
John Joseph Woods

John Joseph Woods was a New Zealand teacher and songwriter. He is best known for winning a competition to set "God Defend New Zealand", a poem by Thomas Bracken, to music. By doing this, he composed the tune to what later became New Zealand's national anthem. Woods was also the Tuapeka County Council clerk for 55 years.

Woods was born in Tasmania in 1849 into an Irish family with fourteen other children, seven boys and seven girls. His father was a soldier. After teaching in Tasmania for nine years, he came to New Zealand as a young man and worked for a time in Nelson, Christchurch, Dunedin and Invercargill. Eight years teaching in New Zealand led to a position as the head teacher of St Patrick's School in Lawrence, Otago, and he moved there from Invercargill in 1874. Woods was known as a good musician. He was choirmaster of the local Catholic church, and could play twelve different instruments, though he was best known for his skill on the violin. Singing a solo at his own wedding, Woods showed that he was also a good singer. 

While in Lawrence, Woods taught with an Irish widow called Harriet Conway (neé Plunket) who already had two sons. They were married in September 1874 and had four children together, three sons and a daughter named Mary. 

In 1902, Woods built a house of brick and wood on the corner of Lismore and Lancaster Streets. He lived there until he died in 1934. It is now under the care of the Historic Places Trust, which mounted a plaque on the street-facing back wall to remember his composition of the national anthem.

One night in the winter of June 1876, Woods read about the competition in the "Saturday Advertiser". According to tradition, he usually met the coach that delivered the news in the main street of Lawrence to pick up his paper. It was already 9 pm, but he went straight to his piano and in that one sitting composed the tune for what later became the national anthem. In a later letter to A.H. Reed, he explained that the words inspired him so much he had to write music for them. He entered his composition under the pen name of "Orpheus". The "Advertiser" sent it off with the eleven other submissions to Melbourne, where it was judged. In October 1876, it was announced that the three judges all agreed that Woods' composition was the clear winner. The prize was ten guineas.

The rules of the competition meant that the copyright of the music would belong to the "Saturday Advertiser", which gave the manuscript to the Dunedin-based Charles Begg & Co to publish, but a nine-month delay in sending it to a publisher was followed by two months of waiting for it to be printed. The end result was a very poor edition with only one verse, which was thrown out by the "Advertiser". When promises of reprint failed to come true, the "Advertiser" was forced to hand the copyright back over to Woods. He immediately arranged for it to be printed by Hopwood and Crew in London, with Bracken's blessing. Bracken did not mean for his poem to become the national anthem, and it was Woods who had always used the word "anthem" where Bracken called it a "hymn".

Being a choirmaster, Woods' focus in composing the melody was to make it simple and easy for children to sing. This proved to help its success when the Premier George Grey visited Lawrence on 11 March 1878 and was welcomed by six hundred local schoolchildren singing what was by then beginning to be labelled as the "national anthem". Grey was very taken by the music and immediately sent a telegram to Bracken congratulating him.

In 1877, Woods stopped teaching and became the county clerk for the Tuapeka County Council. He was known for working 13-hour days and keeping accounts of such a high standard that he was accepted as a fellow of the Registered Accountants of New Zealand. Serving in this role, he also became known as an authority on county law, sought out by the council and clerks of other regions. He also organised the decoration of council office buildings to mark Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897.

He served in that role for 55 years until ill health forced him to retire in 1932, aged 83.

Woods was deeply involved in the affairs of the town. He was a member of many local clubs and societies. He was also known as an expert on cultivating daffodils, of which his collection was the largest in the area. In 1884, Woods was elected first president of the local choral society.

When Woods was made an Honorary Freeman of New Zealand, he was commended for his "efficiency, integrity and devotion to duty".

FC Twente

FC Twente is a football club from Enschede in the Netherlands. They play in the Eredivisie and also in the UEFA Champions League.

Twente plays its games in the Grolsch Veste (a capacity of 30 000).

FC Twente currently holds the national cup and the Johan Cruijff Schaal. In season 2010/11 they ended second in the league.

FC Twente was founded on 1 July 1965 as a combination of Sportclub Enschede and Enschedes Boys. The two professional football teams in Enschede at that time (Sportclub Enschede and Enschedese Boys) had both money problems and were forced to merge. FC Twente started in the Eredivisie (highest Dutch league) and within a few years they were part of the top of Dutch football. Between 1970 and 1980 they came close to several prizes, but they always lost the final. In 1974 the ended second in the Eredivisie and in 1975 the lost the Dutch cup final as well as the UEFA Cup final (after beating Juventus in the semi-final). Only in 1978 they won the Dutch Cup (by beating PEC Zwolle in the final with 3-0). In the next decade (1980-1990) the club went down hill, with the relegation to the Eerste Divisie (second tier of Dutch football) in 1983 as all-time low. Twente was back in the Eredivisie within a year however. In the nineties Twente played a modest role in Dutch football, usually ending around the 5th place in the Eredivisie. 
In the first decade of the 21st century the golden era started. In 2001 FC Twente won the Dutch cup by beating PSV Eindhoven in the final with a penalty shootout. This victory caused huge celebrations in the eastern part of the Netherlands. This showed the popularity of the club in the region, eventhough FC Twente almost never wins a prize. In 2003 the club almost went bankrupt and Joop Munsterman took over as chairman. He understood the potential of this club and developed a plan to increase the sportive, economic and social capacity of Twente. In 2008 the stadium size was increased from 13,500 to 24,000 seats. In 2011 the stadium was further increased to 30,000 seats. FC Twente again played on the top of the Dutch league, resulting in their first national title in 2010. Also the Intertoto Cup was won in 2006, the Johan Cruijff Schaal was won in 2010 and 2011 and the Dutch cup in 2011. In these years FC Twente also started a social programm to help unemployed people to find a job, encourage handicaped people to do sports and to give away free seats in the stadium to people that cannot afford a ticket.

Sailing is the craft of controlling a boat that uses the force of the wind as a source of movement. Sailing boats were very important to move cargo and people. Starting at the end of the 19th century they were gradually replaced by the boats that used steam to generate motion. Today, sailing is a hobby some people have. In some regions of the world, sailing vessels still keep their importance. 

Many military forces also have sailing vessels for the purpose of training. 

Sailing is also a competitive sport. It is one of the sports in the Olympic Games.

SOAP (protocol)

SOAP, or the Simple Object Access Protocol is a protocol using in computing. Web services use this protocol to communicate. SOAP uses XML to encode a message. It uses other application-layer protocols, for transport, and content negotiation, for example HTTP and Remote Procedure Call. The most common combination is to use SOAP with HTTP and TCP. There are different versions, 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. Since version 1.2 the protocol is simply called "SOAP". This is because the protocol is not "simple", and that it can be used for other purposes than accessing objects.

Cinchona pubescens

Cinchona pubescens, the Quinine Tree, is known for because its bark has a lot of quinine. It has similar uses to "Cinchona officinalis" in making quinine, used for treatment of malaria. It is native to Costa Rica, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. In Ecuador, "C. pubescens" is found at altitudes from 300 to 3900 m above sea level. It grows to about 10 metres in height. It has the widest distribution of all "Cinchona" species 

Planted on other tropical islands it has become an invasive species. It grows quickly, and spreads by both seeds and root suckers. Other plants are unable to grow in the shade that it creates. In the Galapagos Islands the tree was planted by farmers as a crop for the quinine. It has become a dominant species on Santa Cruz Island, taking over from the shrub Miconia and Fern-Sedges. It is also invasive in Hawaii on Maui and the Big Island.

Attempts have been made to control the plant in the Galapagos National Park using a variety of methods. It is not affected by many poisons, it will regrow from a stump or any piece of root left in the ground. Controlling it over all of Santa Cruz island would cost several million US dollars according to research by the Charles Darwin Foundation.

International Friendship Day

International Friendship Day celebrations take place on the first Sunday of August every year. On this day, people spend time with their friends and express love for them. The exchange of Friendship Day gifts like flowers, cards, and wrist bands is a popular tradition of this occasion.

In 1935, the United States Congress proclaimed the 1st Sunday of August as National Friendship Day. Since then, celebration of National Friendship Day became an annual event.

Many other countries around the world adopted the tradition of dedicating a day to friends. In 1997, the United Nations named Winnie the Pooh as the world's Ambassador of Friendship. Today, Friendship Day is enthusiastically celebrated by many nations.

Many friends wish each other with exchange of gifts and cards on this day. "Friendship bands" are very popular in India, Nepal and parts of South America. Members of social networking sites celebrate Friendship Day on-line.

You do not have to buy a gift or spend money to enjoy Friendship Day. This avoids accusations the fun is only a "marketing gimmick".

Joseph Merrick

Joseph Carey Merrick (5 August 1862 – 11 April 1890) was an English man who had a deformed face and body because of an illness. To make money, he was shown at freak shows and was called the 'Elephant Man'. He then became famous after he went to live at the London Hospital. Some people who wrote about him thought he was called John Merrick, but they were wrong. Merrick was born in Leicester, England and started to become deformed when he was very young. He was also disabled after he hurt his hip. When he was 11, his mother died and his father married another woman. Merrick left school aged 12 and tried to find a job but it was difficult because he was deformed and disabled. His father and stepmother did not want him at home so he left home and when he was 17, he went to live in a workhouse.

In 1884 Merrick wrote to a showman called Sam Torr and asked him to show Merrick as a "freak" exhibition. Torr showed Merrick around the East Midlands, and then Merrick went to London. He stayed in a shop on Whitechapel Road, with people paying to look at him. A surgeon called Frederick Treves came to see Merrick and took photographs of him. Soon afterwards, Merrick's shop was closed by the police and he went to Belgium.

In Belgium, Merrick was robbed by his manager and left in Brussels alone. He found his way back to London, and Frederick Treves took him to the London Hospital where he worked. Merrick was allowed to live there for the rest of his life. Rich and famous people of Victorian London came to visit him there.

Merrick died on 11 April 1890, aged 27. He died of either asphyxia (not being able to breathe properly) or a broken neck. He had tried to lie down to go to sleep, but his head was too heavy for him to do that. Today, nobody knows for sure what was wrong with Merrick. Scientists think that he either had an illness called neurofibromatosis type I, one called Proteus syndrome, or both of these illnesses. In 1980, film director David Lynch made a film about Merrick called "The Elephant Man".

John Logie Baird

John Logie Baird (13 August 1888 – 14 June 1946) was a Scottish engineer and inventor of the world's first working television system, and the world's first fully electronic colour television tube.

Baird was born in Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire, Scotland. He went to school at Larchfield Academy in Helensburgh and then went to the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College (which later became the University of Strathclyde); and the University of Glasgow. He stopped being a student at the beginning of World War I.

Although lots of inventors helped to make television, Baird was an important person and made big advances. Especially in Britain, lots of people say that Baird was the first person to make a live, moving, greyscale television picture from reflected light. Baird did this by making a better photoelectric cell and making the signal conditioning better. 

In 1925, Baird showed people his moving pictures on television at Selfridges department store in London. In 1928, he showed the world's first colour television transmission. 

In 1927, Baird made a signal go over between London and Glasgow; Baird sent the world's first long-distance television pictures to the Central Hotel at Glasgow Central Station.

Baird then started the Baird Television Development Company Ltd, and in 1928 it made the first transatlantic television transmission, from London to Hartsdale, New York, and the first television programme for the BBC.

Baird's television systems were replaced by the electronic television system developed by EMI-Marconi.

Baird did lots of work for the field of electronic television after mechanical systems stopped being used. In 1939, he showed colour television using a cathode ray tube. 

Some of Baird's early inventions did not work. In his twenties he tried to make diamonds by heating graphite and ruined Glasgow's electricity supply. Later Baird made a glass razor which did not get rusty, but it shattered. 

From December 1944 until he died two years later, Baird lived at a house in Station Road, Bexhill-on-Sea, immediately north of the station. Baird died in Bexhill-on-Sea, Sussex, England on 14 June 1946 after a stroke in February 1946. The old house was knocked down in 2007.

John Logie Baird was buried with his mother, father and wife in Helensburgh Cemetery, Dunbartonshire.

AIDS orphan

An AIDS orphan is a child who became an orphan because at least one of their parents died of AIDS. (An orphan is a child with no parents.)

The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), use the term "AIDS orphan" to talk about children whose mothers died of AIDS before the child's 15th birthday, whether the child's father is still alive or not. Because of this, some people say that 80% of all "AIDS orphans" still have one parent who is still alive.

There are 70,000 new AIDS orphans a year. People in the past have guessed that by the year 2010, over 20 million children would be AIDS orphans.

Because most people who get AIDS are people who have sex, most people who die of AIDS are people who make most of their family's money (because most people who have sex are old enough to work). This means that many AIDS orphans need help from their country's government to live, and need money. This happens a lot in Africa especially.

In 2007, South Africa had more AIDS orphans than any other country, (although South Africa uses the term "AIDS orphan" differently than UNICEF and WHO. South Africa uses the term to talk about children under age 18 who lost either their father or their mother to AIDS). In 2005, the country with the highest percentage of AIDS orphans among the country's orphans was Zimbabwe.

Hejaz is the western region of Saudi Arabia stretching along the Red Sea (Sea of Hejaz). It extends from Taif in the south to Khyber in the north. There are four important cities in this region. The largest city is Jeddah (about 3.2 million inhabitants), called the Bride of the Red Sea, and is located in the middle of the Red Sea coast. Jeddah is the economic and tourism capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Mecca (about 1.4 million inhabitants) is the holy city for Muslims because of Al-Haram Mosque and Al-Kaaba. Muslims face this city when they pray. The second most holy city is Medina (about 1.4 million inhabitants) which was the first capital of Islam. This is where the Mosque Of Prophet Muhammad is and where the Prophet Muhammad lived. There are a lot of monuments and historical places. The youngest city is Taif (about 900,000 inhabitants). Taif is a tourist city in Saudi Arabia due to the cooler climate compared with the other cities. Hejaz has spiritual, cultural, economic and tourist importance.

Endianness

Endianess refers to how hexadecimal data is ordered in machine language, the simplest, most understandable code that a computer can use.

In computer coding, certain numbers, usually two bytes long (1 byte = 8 bits) that are called "words", can be written or input in two ways: little-endian and big-endian. It depends on the data format and the way the computer reads the data.

Say that we have a "word" like this:
12AB ---> 12 | AB
Now, the way it's written right now is big-endian, because the bigger number is on the end. (In hexadecimal, the numbers go from 0 to 9, then from A to F. After F, a 1 is added to the front. [e.g. F+1=10, which is 16 in our numbering system])

To write it in little-endian, we simply switch the positions of the first two and the last two bits, so it becomes:
AB12 ---> AB | 12

Mercedes-Benz HighPerformanceEngines

Mercedes-Benz HighPerformanceEngines Ltd. is an English-based Formula One engine builder. The company used to be known as Mercedes-Ilmor. They are owned by Mercedes-Benz. Since 1995, their engines have been used by the McLaren Formula One race cars. For the season, Mercedes-Benz also supplied the Brawn GP and Force India teams with engines. In season Mercedes supplies McLaren, Force India. They also supply the engines for the new Mercedes-Benz factory team, Mercedes GP, which was formed from the Brawn GP team.

Ilmor was founded by Mario Illien and Paul Morgan in 1983, as an independent British Formula One engine manufacturer. The company name was taken from the last names of the founders. It originally started building engines for IndyCars. They received financial support from IndyCar team owner and builder Roger Penske. 

The Daimler-Benz company purchased Chevrolet's 25% share of Ilmor in 1993. In 2002 Daimler AG increased its share to 55% and renamed the company Mercedes-Ilmor. In 2005 Daimler became the sole owner of Ilmor and renamed the company Mercedes-Benz HighPerformanceEngines Ltd.

One division of the company was called Special Projects. Since 2003, Special Projects had been building Honda's Indy Racing League engines. In 2005, Special Projects split from Mercedes-Ilmor and became a separate company named Ilmor Engineering Ltd. Ilmor Engineering is owned by Mario Illien and Roger Penske. This new company is totally independent of Mercedes-Benz.

In Ilmor entered Formula One as an engine supplier. They supplied engines to the Leyton House team. Leyton House was formerly known as March. In 1992, Leyton House changed its name back to March and continued using Ilmor engines. 

Ilmor also supplied engines to the Tyrrell team in . Powered by an Ilmor V10, Tyrrell scored 8 points, and March 3 points in the Formula One Championship.

Ilmor had developed a good name in F1. When the Sauber sportscar-team and Mercedes-Benz were planning to enter Formula One together, they made a deal with Ilmor. However, Ilmor deceided not to put the slogan "Concept by Mercedes-Benz" on the engines. Since the engines were officially called Ilmor, Mercedes backed out of the project with Ilmor. 

After an unexpectedly fast performance in , Sauber convinced Mercedes to join officially in 1994. In Ilmor also supplied the new Pacific GP team of Keith Wiggins with the old 1993 version of the engines. Pacific only managed to qualify seven times in thirty-two tries. The Ilmor engine was not the cause of this poor performance.

Ilmor became the engine partner to McLaren in . The partnership received its first win at the 1997 Australian Grand Prix. Mika Häkkinen won the driver's championships in the and seasons. The McLaren team won the constructor's championship in . After not winning a single race in the season, McLaren bounced back and won the driver's championship in season with Lewis Hamilton.

In 2001 Paul Morgan was killed while landing his vintage (antique) plane at Sywell Aerodrome, Northamptonshire. This led to Mercedes-Benz increasing their financial involvement in Ilmor, and renamed the company Mercedes-Ilmor Ltd.

<doc id="254276" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=254276" title="Age of majority">
Age of majority

The age of majority is the age that children in a country become adults by law. This means that they are legally in control over their own actions and decisions, and their parents are no longer responsible for them. When used this way, the word "majority" means having the full number of years to be an adult. The opposite is "minority", which means being a minor or child. The law in a given place may never actually use the words "age of majority" when deciding when people become adults. The age of majority is a legally fixed age and idea of adulthood which is different in different places. It may not match the actual maturity of a person's body or mind.

Once a person reaches the age of majority, there are some things they can do that they could not do before. These may include buying stocks, voting, buying or drinking alcohol, driving cars on public roads, and marrying without having to ask for permission. The ages that these things can be done are different depending on where the person lives.

Even after a person reaches the age of majority, there may be other age-based rules that they still have to follow, such as the right to stand for office in elections or become a judge. For example, the youngest a person is allowed to purchase alcohol is 21 in all U.S. states even though the age of majority is 18. The age of majority in the Republic of Ireland is 18, but a person must be over 21 years old to stand for election. 

"Emancipation" is when a child is freed from the responsibility and care of their parents or legal guardians before they reach the age of majority. This is different from the way a child is given into foster care- emancipation allows the minor to be treated as an adult before they have actually reached the age of majority.

In almost all places, minors who are married are automatically emancipated. Some places also do the same for minors who are in the armed forces or who have a certain degree or diploma. 

This is a list of the age of majority in various countries (or administrative divisions):

Age 14

Age 15

Age 16
Age 17

Age 18

Age 19

Age 20

Parvicursor

Parvicursor (meaning "small runner") is a genus of tiny maniraptoran dinosaur with long slender legs for fast running. At only about 39 cm (~15 in) from snout to end of tail, and 162 grams (5.7 ounces) in weight, it is one of the smallest non-avian dinosaurs known from an adult specimen.

Caenagnathasia

Caenagnathasia (meaning 'recent jaw from Asia') was a small oviraptorosaurian dinosaur (superfamily Caenagnathoidea), measuring only 1 m (3 ft) in length and weighing around 8 kg (18 lb). Like all oviraptorosaurs, "Caenagnathasia" had three fingers on each 'hand' and three toes on each 'foot', with bone fusion similar to that of birds. 

"Caenagnathasia" lived in the Upper Cretaceous, around 90 million years ago.

<doc id="254307" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=254307" title="Anchiornis">
Anchiornis

Anchiornis ('near bird') is a genus of small, feathered, troodontid dinosaurs. "Anchiornis huxleyi" is named in honour of Thomas Henry Huxley, the first to propose a close evolutionary relationship between birds and dinosaurs. A complete individual would be 34 cm (13 in) and weigh only 110 g (3.9 oz), making it the smallest known feathered dinosaur.

"Anchiornis" fossils have been found in Liaoning, China, dating to the mid-late Jurassic period, 160 to 155 million years ago.

"Anchiornis" is a small, early troodontid dinosaur with a triangular skull like other troodontids. Also, "Anchiornis" had long legs, usually an indication of a strong runner. However, the extensive leg feathers indicate that long legs may be an vestigial trait, because running animals tend to have reduced, not increased, hair or feathers on their legs. The forelimbs of "Anchiornis" were also very long, unusual among troodontids (which tend to be short-armed) but similar to dromaeosaurids and early birds, emphasizing its basal ('primitive') position among dinobirds. 

While the first specimen of "Anchiornis" preserved only faint traces of feathers around the preserved portion of the body, the well-preserved second specimen showed nearly complete feather preservation, allowing researchers to identify the structure of the feathers and how they were distributed.

As in other early birds, such as "Microraptor", "Anchiornis" had large wings, made up of flight feathers attached to the arm and hand (as in modern birds) as well as flight feathers on the hind legs, forming an arrangement of fore and hind wings. The forewing of "Anchiornis" was composed of 11 primary feathers and 10 secondary feathers. Unlike "Microraptor", the primary feathers in "Anchiornis" were about as long as the secondaries and formed a more rounded wing, with curved but symmetrical central vanes, a small and thin relative size, and rounded tips, all indicating poorer aerodynamic ability compared to its later relative. In "Microraptor" and "Archaeopteryx", the longest forewing feathers were closest to the tip of the wing, making the wings appear long, narrow, and pointed. However, in "Anchiornis", the longest wing feathers anchored near the wrist, making the wing broadest in the middle and tapering near the tip for a more rounded, less flight-adapted profile.

The hind wings of "Anchiornis" were also shorter than those of "Microraptor", and were made up of 12–13 flight feathers anchored to the tibia (lower leg) and 10–11 to the metatarsus (upper foot). Also unlike "Microraptor", the hind wing feathers were longest closer to the body, with the foot feathers being short and directed downward, almost perpendicular to the foot bones. Unlike any other known Mesozoic dinosaur, the feet of "Anchiornis" (except for the claws) were completely covered in feathers (much shorter than the ones making up the hind wing).

Two types of simpler, downy (plumaceous) feathers covered the rest of the body, as in "Sinornithosaurus". Long downy feathers covered almost the entire head and neck, torso, upper legs,and the first half of the tail. The rest of the tail bore pennaceous tail feathers (rectrices).

In 2010, a team examined numerous points among the feathers of an extremely well-preserved "Anchiornis" specimen to survey the distribution of melanosomes, the pigment cells that give feathers their colour. By studying the melanosomes and comparing them with those of modern birds, the scientists were able to map the colours and patterning present on "Anchiornis" when it was alive. Though this technique had been used before, "Anchiornis" became the first Mesozoic dinosaur for which almost the entire life colouration was known.

Most of the body feathers of "Anchiornis" were grey and black. The crown of head feathers was mainly reddish with a grey base and front, and the face had rufous speckles among predominantly black head feathers. The fore and hind wing feathers were white with black tips. The coverts (shorter feathers covering the bases of the long wing feathers) were grey, contrasting the mainly white main wings. The larger coverts of the wing were also white with grey or black tips, forming rows of darker dots along mid-wing. These took the form of dark stripes or even rows of dots on the outer wing (primary feather coverts) but a more uneven array of speckles on the inner wing (secondary coverts). The shanks of the legs were grey other than the long hind wing feathers, and the feet and toes were black.

Like many modern birds, "Anchiornis" exhibited a complex pattern of coloration with different colours in speckled patterns across the body and wings, or "within- and among-feather plumage coloration". In modern birds, such colour patterning is used in communication and display, either to members of the same species (e.g. for mating or territorial threat display) or to threaten and warn off competing or predatory species.

"Anchiornis" is notable for its long forelimbs, which were 80% of the total length of the hind limbs. This is similar to "Archaeopteryx"; long forelimbs are necessary for flight. "Anchiornis" also had a more avian wrist than other non-avialan theropods. The authors first thought that "Anchiornis" could fly or glide. However, further finds showed that the wings of "Anchiornis", while well-developed, were short when compared to later species like "Microraptor", with relatively short primary feathers that had rounded, symmetrical tips, unlike the pointed, aerodynamically proportioned feathers of "Microraptor". So the animal could glide, but probably not fly.

"Anchiornis" has long hind legs, suggesting a fast-running lifestyle. However, the legs and even feet and toes of "Anchiornis" were covered in feathers, making it unlikely that "Anchiornis" was a capable ground runner. A tree-based glider is the probable life-style.

Šumadija

Šumadija (Serbian Cyrillic: Шумадија) is a geographical region in Serbia. The area was heavily forested, hence the name ("Šuma" - forest). The city of Kragujevac is the center of the region, and the administrative center of the Šumadija District in Central Serbia.

Šumadija is located between rivers Sava and Danube in the north, river Velika Morava in the east, river Zapadna Morava in the south, and Kolubara, Ljig and Dičina in the west. According to some interpretations (for example, physiologists such as Jovan Cvijić and ethnologist such as Erdeljanović. ), the northern border of Šumadija lay between Avala and Kosmaj mountain. According to that view, the capital of Serbia, Belgrade does not belong to this region.

During the 18th century, the forests of Šumadija were the refuge for the Hajduks that fought against Ottoman occupation. The first Serbian uprising in 1804 was led by national hero Karađorđe. The second Serbian uprising in 1815 was led by Miloš Obrenović who successfully repelled the Turkish forces and, by 1830, Serbia had gained its full autonomy. Because of Miloš's efforts and negotiations Serbia was finally an independent state, after centuries under Ottoman reign.

Between 1922 and 1929, one of the administrative units of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was named Šumadijska Oblast. It roughly included territory of present-day Šumadija District with its administrative seat in Kragujevac, which is the seat of the modern district as well.

Some of the large cities and towns in Šumadija are:

Other smaller towns include:

Padlock

A padlock is a type of portable lock that has a U-shaped shackle that will not come apart from the body of the lock unless the correct key is inserted or the correct combination is dialed. The U-shape of the lock allows for a wide variety of uses. Typically the padlock is used to lock two things together, for example, a door and its frame, two or more chains, or a chain and a fixed object. Padlocks are not recommended for high-security applications because the shackle is easily cut with a bolt cutter or hacksaw. Some newer padlocks have hardened boron alloy shackles or shrouded (hidden or covered) shackles to make them more difficult to cut.

The combination padlock is usually made with a metal "can" with three tumblers inside connected to a dial on the front. The mechanism is very similar to that used in safes. When the correct combination is entered, the notches on the tumblers line up and allow a latch to fall into the notches, releasing the shackle. The laminated padlock is constructed from a series of metal plates that are riveted together. The shackle of most padlocks is made from hardened steel, although more expensive padlocks may have boron alloy steels to make them more difficult to cut. Inexpensive padlocks usually have a shackle made of ordinary steel. Corrosion-resistant padlocks usually have a brass or stainless steel shackle. The material that the shackle is made of is usually stamped in the center of the shackle. For example, a hardened steel shackle will be stamped "HARDENED" or a boron alloy shackle will be stamped "BORON ALLOY". The shackle is usually plated with another metal such as chrome to protect it from rust. The body of the padlock is usually also plated. Brass and stainless steel padlocks do not need plating, although they are sometimes plated anyway for appearance.

The stamp on the shackle indicates what material it is made of. The most common are:

Market economy

A market economy is economy in which the prices of the products and services are chosen in a free price system that is decided by supply and demand. It began around the late 18th century, after the Industrial Revolution. A key work was Adam Smith's "The Wealth of Nations", 1776.

Market economics has been praised and widely used because of its efficiency (ability to work well). However, it has also been criticized for its selfishness and the difference between the rich and poor. In the real world, market economies are not purely market economies, as societies and governments control them in some ways instead of market forces. The expression "free-market economy" is sometimes used as the same as market economy. Nobel Prize in Economics winner Ludwig von Mises said that a market economy is still a market economy even if the government joins in in pricing.

Epidexipteryx

Epidexipteryx ('display feather') is a genus of small maniraptoran dinosaurs, known from one fossil specimen in Beijing. "Epidexipteryx" is the earliest known example of ornamental feathers in the fossil record. It is a small maniraptoran dinosaur from the Middle or Upper Jurassic age Daohugou Beds of Inner Mongolia, China (perhaps 152 to 168 million years ago).

It is known from a well preserved partial skeleton that includes four long feathers on the tail, composed of a central rachis and vanes. However, unlike in modern-style tail feathers, the vanes were not branched but made up of a single ribbon-like sheet. "Epidexipteryx" also preserved a covering of simpler body feathers. They are unique in that some appear to arise from a "membranous structure".

In all, the skeleton of "Epidexipteryx hui" measures 25 centimeters (10 inches) in length (44.5 cm or 17.5 in including the incomplete tail feathers), and the authors estimated a weight of 164 grams, smaller than most other early dinobirds.

The skull of "Epidexipteryx" is also unique in a number of features. It had teeth only in the front of the jaws, with unusually long front teeth angled forward, a feature only seen in "Masiakasaurus" among other theropods. The tail of "Epidexipteryx" bore unusual vertebrae towards the tip which resembled the feather-anchoring pygostyle of modern birds and some oviraptors.

Despite its close relationship to avialan birds, "Epidexipteryx" appears to have lacked wing feathers, and so it could not fly. Zhang "et al." suggest that unless "Epidexipteryx" evolved from flying ancestors and subsequently lost its wings, this may indicate that advanced display feathers on the tail may have predated flying or gliding flight.

There is uncertainty about the age of the Daohugou Beds in which this fossil was found. Various papers have placed the fossils here anywhere from the Middle Jurassic (169 million years ago) to the Lower Cretaceous (122 ma). The age of this formation has implications for the relationship between similar dinosaurs, as well as for the origin of birds in general. A Middle Jurassic age would mean that the bird-like dinosaurs in the Daohugou beds are older than the 'first bird', "Archaeopteryx", which was late Jurassic in age. Until this question is decided, the significance of "Epidexipteryx" (and other early dinobirds from that area) is not clear.

Foxtrot

The Foxtrot, or "Slow foxtrot", is an English ballroom dance which developed from American band music. It is now one of the international standard ballroom dances. All ballroom dance competitions controlled by the World Dance Council include the Foxtrot.

All the standard ballroom dances had their origins abroad, but were adapted and modified by English dancers into their modern style. The Waltz came from Germany around 1810. The Tango came from Argentina. The Foxtrot and Quickstep were greatly influenced by American music.

An American dance called the Boston arrived in England about 1903. This had fairly slow, gliding steps. It is a characteristic of the Foxtrot that in the basic steps, unlike the other dances, the feet slide past each other rather than coming together. The Boston seems to have been the first dance to move the feet in this way. The Boston also was the first ballroom dance to be done with feet parallel (rather than turned out, as in ballet).
The Boston, like much else, was finished off by the First World War. Crowded dance floors in wartime left no room for it, and new musical imports arrived from America.

Ragtime and jazz came to Europe, and were great sensations. Both the music, and the many 'craze' dances contributed. After the war the big bands of Paul Whiteman took centre stage. He played 'arranger's jazz', meaning, the band played from charts rather than by ear. Whiteman's bands were hugely successful (there were several). 

"The decade between 1910 and 1920", said one writer, "was the period in which America went dance mad". "From 1912 through 1914", said another, "over one hundred new dances found their way in and out of our fashionable ballrooms".
These are a few examples: The Shimmy, The Grind, The Turkey Trot, The Bunny Hug, The Texas Tommy, The Cakewalk... Almost all these dances originated in the black community in the United States, and some moved over into white society.

During the 1920s, English professional dancers and dance teachers set out to find ways of dancing to the new music. In their opinion, what was needed was separate dances for different tempos. So what happened was that the Foxtrot, which had started off as a mid-tempo dance influenced by ragtime, gradually split into two dances, a Slow foxtrot and a quick foxtrot. The difference in tempo allowed the dances to become, in time, different in style as well as music. The Quickstep (as it was soon called) was influenced by the Charleston, and the Slow foxtrot by ideas from the Boston. The syncopation which is still common in the quickstep is an example of ragtime influence on modern dancing.

Where did the name 'foxtrot' come from? It is often said that Foxtrot took its name from its inventor, the vaudeville actor Harry Fox; however the exact origins are not clear. The dance was premiered in 1914, quickly catching the eye of the talented husband and wife duo Vernon and Irene Castle, who lent the dance its signature grace and style.

W.C. Handy's "Memphis Blues" was said to be the inspiration for the Foxtrot. The Castles' music director would play the Memphis Blues during breaks from the fast paced Castle Walk and One-step. The Castles were intrigued by the rhythm. They introduced the 'Bunny Hug' in a magazine article. They went abroad and in mid-ocean sent a wireless to the magazine to change the Bunny Hug to the 'Foxtrot'.

Symphony No.8 (Mahler)

Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major by Gustav Mahler (1860–1911) is one of the largest choral works in classical music. It needs a huge orchestra to play it and a huge choir to sing. Because so many performers are needed it is often called "Symphony of a Thousand", but that is not a name that Mahler gave to it.

Mahler worked very hard at it, composing it in quite a short time at Maiernigg in southern Austria in the summer of 1906. It was the last of Mahler's works that was to be given its first performance in his lifetime. The symphony was given its first performance in Munich on 12 September 1910.

Symphonies are usually pieces of music played just by an orchestra, but Beethoven started a tradition of having singing in symphonies: his Ninth Symphony is the famous one with the Ode to Joy in the last movement. Mahler took up this idea of combining singing with symphony. His Symphonies Nos 2, 3, and 4 all have singing in them. The next three are just for orchestra, but in No. 8 he uses singing again.

Symphony No. 8 is very unusual because he does not have the usual three or four movements with traditional forms such as sonata form. The whole symphony is in two parts. Part I is based on the Latin text of a ninth-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, "Veni creator spiritus" ("Come, Creator Spirit"). Part II is in German. The words come from the closing scene of Goethe's "Faust". 

The two parts have a common idea: the idea of being saved through the power of love. Musically Mahler does this by sharing tunes throughout the symphony. The symphony expresses the confidence of the eternal human spirit.

For many years after Mahler’s death it was not often performed. It is, of course, a very expensive symphony to perform because of the vast numbers of musicians needed. It also needs to be performed in a very large concert hall. Today it is played more often. The 100th anniversary of its first performance will be celebrated in July 2010in the opening concert of the BBC Proms is the Royal Albert Hall, London.

Opinions about the symphony have been divided. Some people did not think the optimism expressed in the music was really convincing. Other people have said it is one of the greatest musical expressions of humanity.

<doc id="254500" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=254500" title="Simon Boccanegra">
Simon Boccanegra

Simon Boccanegra is an opera by Giuseppe Verdi. It is divided into a prologue and three acts. The libretto is by Francesco Maria Piave. The story was based on a play "Simón Bocanegra" (1843) by Antonio García Gutiérrez.

"Simon Boccanegra" was first performed at Teatro La Fenice, Venice on 12 March 1857. It was not very successful, and many years later Verdi made a lot of changes to it. He was helped by the writer Arrigo Boito who made changes to the plot. The new version was first performed at La Scala, Milan on 24 March 1881. This is the version that is normally performed today.

The story is supposed to take place in the middle of the 14th century in Genoa. Genoa (in Italian: Genova) is now a town in Italy, but in those days Italy was not yet one country, and Genoa, like Venice, was a small republic, ruled by a Doge (pronounced “Doadz” in English. It is an Italian word meaning “duke”). Until the time of this story the Doge had always been chosen from one of the rich patricians. The ordinary, common people (the plebeians), could not be chosen to be the Doge.

At the beginning of the story Fiesco is the Doge of Genoa. He has a daughter Maria. Maria has fallen in love with Simon Boccanegra who is a plebeian, so he would not be important enough to be allowed to marry her, even though he has become a hero because he has fought lots of pirates. Simon and Maria had a child, a young girl. After she was born she was given to an old woman to look after, but one day the old woman died and the small child wandered off alone. She was found wandering by the sea shore by Count Grimaldi who took her and looked after her as if she were his own child.

No one knows what has happened to the child. Count Grimaldi does not know who she is. He thinks she is an orphan.

When the opera begins, Paolo, the leader of the Plebeian party, persuades Pietro to encourage the plebeians to vote for Simon Boccanegra as the new doge of Genoa. Boccanegra arrives and agrees that he would be doge if he were chosen. Simon thinks this would make Fiesco allow him to marry Maria. For the past three months Fiesco has locked his daughter in the palace because she had had a child with Simon. 

Maria dies (we never see her in the opera). Fiesco now laments the death of his daughter. Simon begs Fiesco to forgive him. Fiesco does not tell him Maria has just died. He promises to forgive him only if Simon lets him have his granddaughter. Simon explains he cannot because the child has disappeared. He goes into Maria’s room and finds she is dead. The people sing happily because Simon is the new Doge.

The story of Act I takes place 25 years later. Simon is still the Doge. He has sent many of his enemies into exile and taken away their property. Count Grimaldi is one of the people who has been exiled. In the Grimaldi castle, Fiesco is calling himself Andrea Grimaldi so that people do not know who he is. He is plotting with Simon’s enemies to overthrow him. He does not know that his granddaughter (Simon’s daughter) is the young lady called Amelia Grimaldi who is living in the castle. 

At the beginning of Act I we see Amelia singing a beautiful song about the morning and the sea and the stars. She has a lover, Gabriele Adorno. When he arrives she warns him of the dangers of political plotting. The news is brought that the Doge is coming. Amelia is worried that the Doge will make her marry Paolo, so she asks Gabriele to ask Andrea (who is actually Fiesco) immediately for permission for them to marry. Fiesco agrees. He tells Gabriele that she was a poor orphan who had been found (he does not realize that it is his granddaughter). Gabriele says that he does not care about that, so Fiesco blesses the marriage.

Simon enters. He tells her that Count Grimaldi is forgiven and can return home. He asks her whether she would like to marry Paolo, but she refuses. She tells him that she is an orphan and she shows him a locket with a picture of her mother. Simon realizes that Amelia is his long-lost daughter. They are very happy to have found one another. When Paolo enters, Simon tells him he cannot marry her. Paolo is furious and decides to kidnap Amelia. 

In the next scene we see Simon surrounded by the plebeian and patrician members of his Council. They are discussing whether they should make peace with the republic of Venice. Suddenly a crowd enters shouting for death to Simon. They are chasing Gabriele. Gabriele confesses that he killed Lorenzino for trying to kidnap Amelia. As Lorenzino lay dying he had said that he had been told by an important person to kidnap her. Adorno guesses that Simon must have ordered the kidnapping. He is about to attack him when Amelia rushes in and stops the fight Simon arrests Gabriele. He realizes that Paolo must be the real kidnapper, and makes everybody (including Paolo) curse him. Simon and his daughter are left alone on stage at the end of the act.

Paolo is frightened. He is furious with Simon and decides he must poison him. Fiesco and Gabriele are brought in. He tells Fiesco he can be free if he murders Simon. Fiesco refuses. Just as Fiesco and Gabriele are about to leave, Paolo asks Gabriele whether he knows Amelia is here in the palace having an affair with Simon. Gabriele is furious. When Amelia enters she denies the story. She tells Gabriele she loves him and tries to persuade him to leave, but Simon is coming and Gabriele hides.

Amelia tells Simon that she would die for Gabriele. Simon agrees to pardon him. He drinks from a poisoned glass of wine, which Paolo had put on the table, and falls asleep. Gabriele tries to kill him, but Amelia stops him. Simon wakes up. He tells Gabriele that Amelia is his daughter. Gabriele begs Simon for forgiveness and promises he will fight for him. 

This takes place in a great hall which looks out on the harbour. Fiesco has been set free, but Paolo is condemned to death for leading the uprising against the Doge. Paolo tells Fiesco that he has poisoned Simon. Fiesco goes to Simon, who is now dying (the poison is working slowly). Simon recognizes his old enemy who he thought was dead. He is happy to tell him that Amelia is his long-lost granddaughter. Fiesco feels terribly sad and tells Simon about the poison. Gabriele and Amelia have just got married. They find her father and grandfather are now friends. Simon asks for Gabriele to be the next Doge when he dies. Fiesco goes to the window and announces to the crowd that Gabriele Adorno is now the new Doge and that Simon Boccanegra is dead.

<doc id="254544" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=254544" title="Geyser">
Geyser

A geyser is a hot spring which shoots out water and steam. They erupt when when pressure has built up, often at regular intervals. There are about a thousand geysers around the world. About half are in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States.

Geysers are made in special geological conditions. Only a few places on Earth have these conditions. Because of this, geysers are not very common. One place is the Yellowstone National Park, which is the remains of a gigantic volcano. Another is Iceland, which sits on top of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where new Earth's crust is formed. 

Geysers are often near active volcanos. This is because the geyser is caused by magma. Surface water usually goes down to about . There, it mixes with hot rocks. The pressurized water begins to boil. When it is pressured enough, hot water and steam burst out of the geyser.

Individual geysers do not last forever, but "systems" of geysers last as long as the geological situation continues. The oldest individual geysers are only a few thousand years old. Geysers are usually near volcanic areas. As the water boils, the pressure increases. This forces hot steam and water to the surface through the geyser. Geysers are usually made because of three things that are around volcanoes.




Most importantly, the temperatures near the bottom of the geyser become high enough to start boiling the water. Steam bubbles come out of the top of the column. They burst through the geyser's vent. Some water flows or splashes out. This makes the weight of the column of water and the pressure on the water below less. When this pressure is released, the hot water turns into steam. It boils violently.

The moon has eruptions which are called "geysers". There, the eruption takes place from vapor only. The liquid part is not present there. They are more easily seen because of the bits of dust and ice carried by the vapor. Water vapor streams have been seen near the south pole of Saturn's moon Enceladus. Nitrogen eruptions have been seen on Neptune's moon Triton. Carbon dioxide eruptions from the southern polar ice cap of Mars have also been seen.

<doc id="254575" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=254575" title="Market capitalization">
Market capitalization

Market capitalization (often market cap) is a measurement of size of a business corporation. It is equal to the price of one share of stock, times the number of shares of stock in a public company. Owning stock in a company is owning a part of the company. Market capitalization shows the public opinion of a company's value. The total market capitalization of all publicly traded companies in the world was US$51.2 trillion in January 2007. In May 2008 to rose to US$57.5 trillion. By September 2008, the market cap had dropping a little more than US$40 trillion. 

Market capitalization represents the public opinion of the value of a company's equity. A public corporation, including all of its assets, may be bought and sold as stock. These purchases and sales will define the price of the company's share price. Market capitalization is the share price times by the number of shares in issue. This provides a total value for the company's shares and the value the company.

Some companies have stock that is privately owned, and not publicly traded. Many Stock markets adjust the market cap on the value of the publicly traded part of the company. In this case, market capitalization is based on the publicly traded stocks.

Note that market capitalization is a market estimate of a company's value. It is based how the public believes the company will perform in the future. There are many things that can affect the stock price. These include economic conditions and mergers and acquisitions.

In the past, companies were separated into large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap. New categorizes 'micro-cap' and 'nano-cap' have been added. There are general guidelines to know what category a company is in. These guidelines are adjusted over time due to changes in the market and the economy. For example, $1 billion was a large market cap in 1950 but it is not very large now. 

Different numbers are used by different stock markets. There is no official definition of the exact cutoffs. They also may be done by percentiles rather than fixed cutoffs.

Market cap reflects only the "equity" value of a company. A more comprehensive measure is enterprise value (EV), which includes debt and other factors.
Insurance firms use a value called the embedded value (EV).

Vernon and Irene Castle

Vernon and Irene Castle were a husband-and-wife team of ballroom dancers of the early 20th century. They were famous for developing and promoting dancing in the period of the First World War.

Vernon Castle (2 May 1887 – 15 February 1918) was born William Vernon Blyth in Norwich, Norfolk, England. Irene Castle (17 April 1893 – 25 January 1969) was born Irene Foote, the daughter of a prominent physician in New Rochelle, New York. 

Vernon chose 'Castle' as a stage name when he first performed as a comic, because his sister (also on the stage) already used the family name, Blyth. He had already taken the name before Irene met him in 1910.

Vernon was initially trained to become a civil engineer. He moved to New York in 1906. There he became established as a comic actor and conjuror.

Irene studied dancing and performed in several amateur theatricals before meeting Vernon in 1910. The next year, over her father’s objections, the two were married. The English-born Vernon had already established himself as a dancer in comedic roles. His specialty was playing a gentleman drunk, who elegantly fell about the stage while trying to hide his condition. 

After their marriage, Irene joined Vernon in The Hen-Pecks (1911), a production in which he was a featured player. The two then travelled together to Paris to perform in a dance revue. The show closed quickly, but the couple were hired as a dance act by the Café de Paris. Performing the latest American dances, the Castles were soon the rage of Parisian society. They introduced American ragtime dances, such as the Turkey Trot and the Grizzly Bear.

When the Castles returned to the U.S. in 1912, their success was repeated on a far wider scale. Making their New York debut at a branch of the Cafe de Paris, the duo were soon in demand on stage, in vaudeville and in motion pictures. In 1914, the couple opened a dancing school in New York called "Castle House", a nightclub called "Castles by the Sea" on the Boardwalk in Long Beach New York, and a restaurant, the "Sans Souci".

In addition to cabaret, the Castles also became staples of Broadway. The Castles' greatest success was on Broadway, in Irving Berlin's debut musical "Watch Your Step" (1914). In this extravaganza, the couple refined and popularized the Foxtrot, which vaudeville comedian Harry Fox may have invented. After its New York run, "Watch Your Step" toured through 1916.

The Castles helped remove the stigma of vulgarity from close dancing. The Castles’ performances, often set to ragtime and jazz rhythms, also popularized African-American music among well-heeled whites. Irene’s fashion sense, too, started national trends. Her elegant, yet simple, flowing gowns were often featured in fashion magazines. She also introduced American women to the bob—the short hairstyle favored by flappers in the 1920s (see also Louise Brooks).

The Castles appeared in a newsreel called "Social and Theatrical Dancing" in 1914 and wrote a bestselling instructional book, "Modern Dancing", later the same year. The pair also starred in a feature film called "The Whirl of Life" (1915), which was well-received by critics and public alike. As the couple's celebrity increased in the mid-1910s, Irene Castle became a major fashion trendsetter, with her bobbed hair and shorter skirts. Her chic wardrobe was supplied almost exclusively by the couturière 'Lucile', (Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon) but Irene also designed some of her clothes herself. 

The slim, elegant Castles were trendsetters in many ways: they travelled with a black orchestra, had an openly lesbian manager, and were animal rights advocates long before it became a public issue.

The Castles endorsed Victor Records and Victrolas. They issued records by the Castle House Orchestra, led by James Reese Europe –– a pioneering figure in Black music. They also lent their names to advertising for other products, from cigars and cosmetics to shoes and hats. They were, in short, personalities of the modern kind, who had a gift for self-publicity. They were as famous as any film stars of the day.

Vernon returned to the UK to become a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps during World War I. Flying over the Western Front he shot down two aircraft and was awarded the French Croix de Guerre in 1917. He was posted to Canada to train new pilots, and then promoted to Captain and posted to the US to train American pilots. 

While flying at Benbrook Field, near Fort Worth, Texas, he took emergency action shortly after take off to avoid another aircraft. His plane stalled, and he was unable to recover control. Vernon was the only casualty. Fatally injured, he died soon after the crash, on . Irene paid tribute to Vernon in her memoir "My Husband", 1919.

Irene starred solo in about a dozen silent films between 1917 and 1924 and appeared in several stage productions before retiring from show business. She married three more times –– to Robert Treman, Frederic McLaughlin, and George Enzinger. 
In 1939, her life with Vernon was turned into a movie, "The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle", produced by RKO and starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Irene served as a technical advisor on the film, but clashed with Rogers, who refused to short bob or darken her hair. Irene also objected to white actor Walter Brennan playing their servant: "Walter was BLACK".

For the rest of her life, Irene was a staunch animal-rights activist, ultimately founding the Illinois animal shelter "Orphans of the Storm", which is still active. 

Irene died . Vernon and Irene Castle are interred together in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York. There is a large monument to Vernon Castle near the site of his crash in Benbrook, Texas.

Payment

A payment is the transfer of something from one party (such as a person or company) to another. A payment is usually made in exchange for goods or services.

The simplest and oldest form of payment is barter. This is the exchange of one good or service for another. In the modern world, common means of payment by an individual include money, cheque, debit, credit, or bank transfer. However, there are no arbitrary limits on the form a payment can take. In complex transactions between businesses, payments may take the form of stock or other more complicated arrangements.

In law, the "payer" is the party that makes a payment and the "payee" is the party that receives the payment.

<doc id="254605" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=254605" title="Housecleaning">
Housecleaning

Housecleaning is getting rid of mess, trash, dirt, and unclean actions so a household is better-looking. Tools and ways that work could be used for it. A reason people houseclean is to be able to see parts of the floor and furniture otherwise hidden by clutter. Other reasons are to keep from getting spider bites or breathing problems from dust. People may sweep and vacuum when housecleaning. They can also hang up clothes, do the laundry, and wash windows. Soaking up spilled red wine is another example of cleaning a mess in a house. Washing a sponge, squeezing it out and placing it on a dish rack to dry are a part of housecleaning. When used as a big word, housecleaning is making a group of people be good.

Clutter is too many things in the house. It is because the things have not been put away or because there is nowhere to put them, or both. Places people put things away are shelves, drawers, and hangers. When those storage places are messy or too full they are cluttered. They could be made clean and neat instead. A classic example of clutter is a hall closet with ten years of old boots, coats, and mittens piled on the floor. A workbench covered with tools is cluttered. So is a garage so messy it has no room for the car. Books left out and coats on the backs of chairs are clutter. Old school work and old magazines are clutter. Collections of old pizza boxes and soft drink bottles are both trash and clutter. Packrat style clutter includes things such as a freezer full of meat, too many paintings, old lawnmowers, unused snowmobiles, inherited dishes, and extra furniture. While some clutter is wealth, broken clutter may not be if disorganized. A crowded or messy collection of belongings gets in the way of walking, viewing or using things. Clutter left out makes it harder to dust and vacuum. People sometimes decide to get rid of clutter. They do this by putting things away. If they do not have enough places to put everything away neatly, they sell, give away or throw away things they do not want any more. For example, if the refrigerator is too full, they throw the spoiled food away. If the kitchen cabinets are too full of junk, they might agree to throw some of that away. Getting rid of clutter has been called de-cluttering. Organized storage includes keeping objects together based on what they do and where they are used. People put labels on boxes in the attic, for example. Out-of-season clothes might be stored in the attic. The well-organized household may even have maps or lists of where things are. People report taking weeks to de-clutter. They decide what to keep. They decide where to store things. People sometimes sell old things at consignment shops. Some people have yard or garage sales. People also donate old things to charities that take them. By the time two yeas has gone by, some people have all new clothes. For example, they throw away their old running shoes rather than bronzing them. 

Germs are tiny bugs which make people sick. They are too small to see without a microscope. Some bottles of soap and water that are sold in stores come with poison in them. People wipe these ‘disinfectant cleaners’ on the tub or other surface and then let them evaporate until the surface is dry. They then rinse the soap and poison off the surface. Disinfectant cleaners are used to keep people from getting Athlete’s foot and the Flu. To keep the house and the world safe, people do not use too much disinfectant cleaner. Some kinds of soap can hurt people just because of how strong they are. People do not use those cleaners unless they really need to use them. Ways people get rid of germs include the following. After meat has touched a cutting board, they wash the cutting board. After cleaning with a dish cloth or sponge, they wash the dishcloth or sponge. They then squeeze it out and put it on the dish rack to get dry. If a sponge is dry, no mold will grow on it and no slime or stink will happen. If a dishcloth or sponge gets mold or slime or stink, people throw it into the trash. They get a new sponge or dishcloth. People wash dishes right after meals to make cleaning easier and the kitchen cleaner. They take the kitchen trash outside and put it into a garbage can. Little flies, rotten smell and no more room in the kitchen trash basket may be why. The box or bottle a soap-like cleaner comes in has a label with directions on it. People read the directions to make sure they know how to safely use the cleaner. Some cleaners are very dangerous because they contain acid, bleach, or something else harmful. The label might say to wear goggles or rubber gloves. It might say to open the windows for fresh air. People store bottles and boxes of cleaner in their original containers to know what they are and to be able to re-read the directions on them. They never mix cleaners. This is to prevent accidents and harmful chemical reactions. Mixing two different kinds of cleaner could result in a mixture that is unable to clean, or could cause something dangerous to happen. For example, mixing bleach and ammonia together causes very poison fumes to fill the air. Spot remover, drain cleaner, floor wax, grease remover and paint thinner are examples of volatile cleaners. Fans are turned on and windows are kept open while using cleaners with fumes. People never wear contact lenses or eat or drink or smoke while using dangerous cleaners. When using limestone remover, toilet-bowl cleaner or oven cleaner people work slowly enough to be careful and not get any acid on themselves. Using dangerous cleaners, they wear rubber gloves, goggles, cleaning clothes and they pay attention to what they are doing. They keep the bottle of cleaner closed as much as possible. They are watchful and keep dangerous buckets, spray cans, boxes of floor soap and so forth away from young children and pets. In fact, people read the label before deciding to buy a cleaner.

Green cleaning is cleaning done with as little harm to the world as possible. For example, green housecleaners never pour paint thinner down the drain. Also, they never throw away or pour extra paint or motor oil down the drain. They save it or they give it to someone who wants to use it. This is because oil, paint, paint thinner and other things pass through septic tanks and sewage treatment plants without being made safe. Also, too much bleach, acid, disinfectant and so forth could poison the water in wells, rivers and lakes. Green cleaners try not to buy cleaner that is too strong for the job to be done. They also try not to use more than is needed. People take care of the outdoors. For example, scientists made detergent more like soap so the detergent bubbles on rivers would go away. Soap and detergent are kinds of cleaner. People use the weakest cleaner that works. The strong cleaners melt stone, damage metal, make toxic fumes, contain poison and burn skin. People use the mild cleaners for safety. For example, a sponge damp with warm water cleans counters just fine. If not, half a drop of dish soap is squeezed into the wet sponge. People clean before a strong cleaner is needed. Drying washed hands on cloth towels saves paper towels. Running a full dishwasher instead of a half empty dishwasher lowers the amount of detergent arriving at the septic tank or treatment plant and increases the workout from putting the dishes away. To make room for a new box or bottle of cleaner, people use up old cleaner over a long period of time. Some people use leftover vinegar, salt, baking soda, and olive oil to clean with.

Dust could make a guest sneeze, cough, and get watery eyes. Dust could give someone a rash and trouble breathing. The dust could be made of smoke, cotton, soap particles, pollen, mold spores, dry cat spit, spider web remains, fur, tiny skin flakes, textile and insect fibers, food particles, mold spores, unusual smells, or something the guest is allergic to. People vacuum dust. They wipe dust away with a cloth. They shampoo and vacuum their carpets and sofa. They vacuum mattresses. They wash some things in the kitchen sink. They vacuum or launder or dry clean stuffed animals. They brush dust from cracks. They scrub black mold from showers. They wash their dogs and cats. Some people wear dust masks while vacuuming dusty rooms. They put a towel on their sofa for their cat. Some have central air-conditioning to keep dust out of their house. Some replace their wall to wall carpet with hardwood floors and vacuum under their rugs.
There are five main kinds of cleaning chemicals. 1. Surfactants make water able to get things wet faster. 2. Alkaline chemicals like soap and baking soda are able to get things like mud and hamburger grease off. 3. Acidic chemicals like vinegar and orange juice are able to get off things like mustard, wine, tea, coffee, rust, dry soap suds, and lime scale. 4. Flammable solvents like turpentine are able to remove things like paint. 5. Disinfectants kill germs like fungus and mold. The chemicals are put in “cleaners.” Soap is a kind of cleaner. Some cleaners are so alkaline or acidic they are more dangerous than others. Some cleaners are liquid. Some are dry. Some are in between. Some pour out of box or bottle. Some are sprayed. Some are wrapped in paper or are taken out of a box. There are “all-purpose” cleaners for washing things like tubs, trash cans, counter tops, floors, door frames, stoves, toasters and refrigerators. There are also “one-purpose” cleaners. Examples are limestone remover, toilet-bowl cleaner, drain opener, glass cleaner, metal polish, shower room disinfectant, tub, tile and sink cleaner, rug cleaner, dusting spray, furniture polish and kitchen floor cleaner.

People buy knowledgeable books on cleaning to look things up in as needed. They also read the directions on the boxes and bottles of cleaner and the directions that come with tools. People carry some cleaners and tools in a cleaning kit which is sometimes called a bucket, caddy or basket. They carry them from the closet or utility room where the cleaners and tools are stored to where they are used. After they use the cleaning tools, they clean them. For example, they rinse and squeeze sponges and mops and rinse out buckets. They wash cleaning towels. They wash cleaning clothing. They dust the vacuum cleaner and when its paper bag is full they put in a new one. They then put the cleaners and tools back where they are kept. Cleaning tools are used in the best order to clean without wasting time. The saying is, “Use the right tool for the right job.” Knowledgeable books tell what people have found out and invented. Safety glasses and rubber gloves might be needed. People do general cleaning before reading about shabby things like a pen mark or coffee stain. Because people do not always look forward to the exercise of cleaning, tools that make cleaning easier help make them feel more like cleaning. Many people rent machines like carpet cleaners. Some cleaning tools are the following: tote bag, trash bag, dish tray, whisk broom, dust pan, vacuum cleaner, dust cloth, stepladder, window towel, laundry bags, washing machine, dryer, laundry basket, dish washer, sponge, towels, bucket, mop, rubber gloves, tub brush, and toilet swab.

Make Way for Ducklings

Make Way for Ducklings is a children's picture book written and illustrated by Robert McCloskey. It was first printed in 1941. The book is about two mallard ducks who decide to raise their family on an island in the lagoon in Boston Public Garden, a park in the middle of Boston, Massachusetts.

"Make Way for Ducklings" won the 1942 Caldecott Medal for McCloskey's pictures, drawn in charcoal, then lithographed on zinc. In 2003, the book had sold more than two million copies. The book was so popular a statue of a mother duck and her eight ducklings were set up in the Public Garden. In 1991, Barbara Bush gave a copy of this statue to Raisa Gorbachev as part of the START Treaty, and the work is in Moscow's Novodevichy Park. 

The book is the official children's book of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The book is still highly praised for over 60 years because of its pictures and pace. However, it was criticised for having a loose plot (story) and weak characters. The book is very popular around the world.

Sequence dance

Sequence dancing is a form of dance in which there is a preset pattern of movements, to music. The music is usually also preset. Sequence dancing may include dances of many different styles. The term may include ballroom dances, which move round the floor, as well as line, square and circle dances.

Sequence dancing in general is much older than modern ballroom dances. With the exception of the waltz, invented around 1800, all dances in ballrooms were sequence dances until the early 20th century. The quadrille was one example, the minuet another.

After modern ballroom dancing developed, in England, sequence dancing continued. It included so-called 'Old Time' dances and also adapted versions of the new ballroom dances, and then versions of Latin dances. Sequence dancing is a competitive sport as well as a social pastime.

The British Sequence Championships is the most famous annual sequence dance competition and is part of the Blackpool Sequence Dance Festival. This is held in the Empress Ballroom, Winter Gardens, Blackpool, England, since 1949.

Minos

King Minos was a very powerful king in ancient Greece. He once had a wife named Pasophae. King Minos upset the gods by cheating them in a sacrifice. He told Poseidon that he would sacrifice a beautiful bull that Poseidon gave him after he used it. Instead, he switched it with another bull. They punished him by having Pasphae fall in love with a bull.

Pasophae asked Daedelus to help her, so Daedelus made a mechanical bull suit for her, and she got into it and had a child. It was the Minotaur, half human, half bull. 

King Minos took the Minotaur and put it in a labrynth, or maze, built by Daedelus. When he was in possession of all of Crete, he ordered that fourteen younglings come to him to be sacrificed to the Minotaur. The king’s son volunteered to be one of them, and went there with daughter, Ariadne. He killed the Minotaur in the labyrinth.

After his death, King Minos became one of the judges of the dead in the underworld.

Paso doble

The Paso doble is a dance and music based on the Spanish bullfight. It is the music played at bullfights at the procession of the bullfighters, between stages, and at the end of each session. The dance is based on the way matadors perform in the ring.

In the dance, the man takes the part of the matador, and the woman takes the part of the man's cape ("not" the bull!). The man's stance (the way he stands) should be proud, and when he has a free arm it should be held slightly bent, rather as matadors do. The photograph of the ice dancers gives a perfect example of what dancers should aim for in this style.

The paso doble is one of the five International Latin ballroom dances. It gives a very good contrast in style with the four other dances. Although so Spanish in style and origin, the dance techniques were first developed in Paris. Later, in mid 20th century London, the Latin and American dances took on their present form.

The music is scored in 2/4 time. It is a march-like type of music, and as a dance it is a two-step ("paso doble" = two-step). It is played at about 60/62 bars (measures) a minute for dancers.

The most famous piece of paso doble music is the "España Cañí" or "Spanish Gypsy Dance". A sample of "La Gracia de Dios" gives an idea of the rhythm.

Daedalus

Daedalus was King Minos' head archietct in ancient Greece. When King Minos of Crete was having some sovereignty problems, he asked Poseidon, god of the sea, for an offering to sacrifice to him as a sign as true kingship. So Poseidon sent a snow-white bull straight out of the sea foam. Once the people of Crete saw the bull, they all agreed that it was a sign of true kingship. However, once King Minos saw the bull, he refused to sacrifice the bull, kept it for himself, and sacrificed another bull to Poseidon, thus angering him. Poseidon put a curse on Minos’ wife making her fall in love with the bull. She loved it so much that she wanted to mate with it. Minos called for the help of Daedalus, who built a wooden bull and put Queen Pasiphae inside it, thus calming her anxiety for mating with the bull. She soon became pregnant with half-man, half-bull. Also called the Minotaur. 

King Minos was horrified and asked Daedalus to build some kind of prison to keep the Minotaur from destroying Crete. So Daedalus built a labyrinth that was so complicated that the Minotaur could not get out. Only Daedalus knew the course of the labyrinth. When Minos found that Daedalus was fooling around, he imprisoned Daedalus and his son Icarus, in a high tower. Daedalus made some wings that he strapped to his and Icarus’ arms and together they escaped from the tower. However, Icarus, forgetting his father’s words, flew too close to the sun and the wax that held the feathers together, melted. Icarus fell into the ocean and drowned. Daedalus landed safely on an island, and in grief, he named the sea that he and Icarus had flown across, the Icarian Sea.

Pentateuch means the first five books of the Bible. These books are Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The word "Pentateuch" comes from two Greek words that mean "five books" or "five scrolls".

According to tradition, the books were written by the Israelite leader, Moses. The Pentateuch is often called the Five Books of Moses or the Torah.

The Pentateuch tells the story from the Creation of the world to the death of Moses and the preparation of the Israelites to enter the land of Canaan. The story is told in three parts. The first part (Genesis 1-11) is about the Creation and the beginning of human beings on earth. The second part (Genesis 12-50) are the stories of the ancestors of the Israelites, mainly Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. The third part, beginning with the book of Exodus, describes how the Israelites left Egypt and the early history of the people of Israel as a nation. It also has many laws about how the Israelites must build their society. Deuteronomy is mostly Moses's final speech to his people and a summary of the Pentateuch.

The Pentateuch is the oldest part of the Bible, but scholars do not know exactly when these books were written. The earliest parts may have been written more than 1,000 years before the final parts. Modern archaeological discoveries suggest that some of the oldest stories in Genesis may date back three thousand years.

<doc id="254980" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=254980" title="Death and Adjustment hypotheses">
Death and Adjustment hypotheses

Death and Adjustment Hypotheses is a pair of theory on the phenomenon of death and death anxiety. It is used in adult human development study in psychiatry , spiritual psychiatry and scientific thanatology. 

The theory was formally postulated in full and for the first time in 2007 in the book "Quest for a New Death" by Mohammad Samir Hossain. The same researcher explained the theory further in a second work named "Human Immortality" in 2008. They were reviewed by the journal "Death Studies", the Royal College of Psychiatrists at London, the Scientific and Medical Network and others. The Royal College of Psychiatrists at London and the "Journal of Loss and Trauma" published scientific articles on the theory.

According to this theory, a moral life can give us the clearest perception of death. Changes in our materialistic attitude are necessary to establish such a moral life. It can be a potential remedy to many of the prevailing problems we face, including in the sphere of mental health, to speak out against the rising materialism of modern society. Only then can we contemplate without fear our true death, which is supposedly the end of the perceivable part of our existence but not necessarily of the whole of it.

In the absence of empirical evidence from science, to regard death as not our absolute end seems natural and is an epistemologically sound point of view.

Changing our materialistic view to a moral one on life can help eradicate the social denial of death through the establishment of a sound concept of death (as above), which should also enhance our adjustment to the phenomenon.

Quickstep

The Quickstep is an International Style ballroom dance that follows a 4/4 time beat, at about 50 bars per minute. From its early beginning as a faster Foxtrot, the Quickstep has become quite different. It is danced to the fastest tempo of the ballroom dances.

The Quickstep developed in the 1920s from a combination of the Foxtrot, the Charleston, and other dances. The dance is English in origin, and was standardized in 1927. Although it came from the Foxtrot, the Quickstep now is quite separate. Unlike the modern Foxtrot, the feet often close and syncopated (split-beat) steps occur often. Three characteristic dance figures of the Quickstep are the "chassés", where the feet come together, the "quarter turns", and the "lock step".

This dance became a very dynamic one with a lot of movement on the dance floor, with many advanced patterns including hops, runs, quick steps with a lot of momentum, and rotation. The tempo of Quickstep dance is rather brisk as it was developed to ragtime era jazz music which was fast-paced compared to other dance music.

Today the complexity of Quickstep as done by competition dancers has increased. They use more syncopated steps. While in older times quickstep patterns were counted with "quick" (one beat) and "slow" (two beats) steps, many advanced patterns today are cued with split beats, such as "quick-and-quick-and-quick, quick, slow", with there being further steps on the 'and's.

Waltz (International)

The Waltz is one of the five international ballroom dances in the Modern or Standard style. It is danced socially, and in ballroom competitions. Like its older brother, the Viennese waltz, this dance originated in Vienna, but was greatly modified by English dance teachers in the 1920s. That is why it is sometimes called the English waltz. Other names are the diagonal waltz, the international waltz, and the slow waltz.

Music for the waltz should be in 3/4 time, and played at 29 to 34 bars per minute. The accent is on the first beat of each bar. For beginners it is a simple dance compared to some others. At competitive level it is much more demanding. It features whisks, chassés, spins, hesitations, drags, and split-beat steps, many of which have been copied in other dances. The first 'advanced' figure to be invented was the double reverse spin, by Maxwell Stewart in the 1924 World Championship. Nowadays it is taught at the silver medal stage.

<doc id="255197" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=255197" title="Tracking (education)">
Tracking (education)

Tracking is the method of placing students according to their ability level in homogeneous classes or learning experiences. Students of different abilities (low, middle, and high) are assigned to different "tracks" of courses and programs (vocational, general, college-bound, honors, and AP). Tracking is the term given to this process, and while some teachers believe that tracking makes instruction more manageable, others believe that it is a terribly flawed system. Once a student is placed, it may be very difficult to move up from one track to another. The placements may reflect racism, classism, or sexism. Many educators charge that the United States relies more on tracking than any other nation in the world. Most schools today work hard to avoid using the term "tracking." Middle and high schools are taking their cue from elementary schools, where "ability grouping" has been in favor. Ability grouping sorts students based on capability, but the groupings may well vary by subject. While tracks suggest permanence, ability grouping is more transitory. One year, a student might find herself in a high-ability math group and a low-ability English group. The following year, that same student might be reassigned to a new set of groups. School tracking is a reality functioning under an assumed identity called ability grouping. 

Besides tracking, another way to deal with diversity is to integrate students of different ability levels together in small working groups. Cooperative learning gives students a sense of pride for both their individual performance and that of the group. The students begin to take responsibility for their learning rather than on the teacher. Cooperative learning allows higher achievement in many students and has eased tensions in multicultural classrooms as students learn to work together.

<doc id="255260" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=255260" title="Monsieur Pierre">
Monsieur Pierre

Monsieur Pierre, or simply Pierre, was the professional name of Pierre Jean Phillipe Zurcher-Margolle, (born Toulon, France – London, 1963). Pierre was a professional dancer and dance teacher; he was a Fellow, Examiner and committee member of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD) and a Member of the Official Board of Ballroom Dancing (OBBD).

Pierre was the main person responsible for introducing the Latin American dances to England. He set them up for use in competitions and in social dance. The system he and his colleagues developed became the basis for all Latin American competitions held under the World Dance Council (WDC).

After World War I ended in 1918 he started on a career as a professional ballroom dancer in London. Although he spent the rest of his life resident in London, Pierre never gave up his French citizenship.

The rhythms which make Latin American dance popular were brought to Britain between the two World Wars. Pierre was already an accomplished dancer and teacher in the English ballroom style. In Latin dances, his repertoire first consisted of the Argentine tango, the Paso doble and the Samba.

By the 1930s Pierre had moved more towards the Latin American dances, and in 1934 his full-page trade adverts featured the rumba. The studio stayed open all through World War II, and was a popular meeting place for the Free French fighters on leave in London. Pierre's studio always played authentic music for its LA dance instruction.

Originally, Pierre had visited Paris to find out how their dancers and teachers dealt with the rumba. But after the war, in 1947, Pierre visited Cuba, where he discovered to his surprise that the Cubans danced it differently. When he was there, he danced at the "acadamias" every night. After this he returned to London determined to teach the Cuban rumba, "sistema cubano". To this end, Pierre wrote the first account of his ideas on the rumba as a dance.

One of the characteristics of Cuban dance to the "Son", and other similar rhythms, was, and still is, their method of taking three steps to four beats of music (whether 2/4 or 4/4). The Cuban rumba figure starts on beat 2, counting (pause) 2, 3, 4-1 as (pause) quick, quick, slow with the hip settling over the standing foot on 4-1. 

All social dances in Cuba involve a hip-sway over the standing leg and, though this is scarcely noticeable in fast salsa, it is more pronounced in the slow ballroom rumba. In general, steps are kept compact and the dance is without any rise and fall. The argument in favour of this method was authenticity, and also satisfaction at the dance effect the Cuban style achieved. 

The Latin and American section of the ISTD Ballroom Branch was formed in 1947 by Monsieur Pierre as Chairman. The syllabus finally agreed in 1955 has been the foundation of teaching and competition in the Latin American dances ever since. This work naturally included the Samba, Paso doble and Jive as well. After further visits to Cuba in the early 1950s, when Doris Lavelle and James Arnell accompanied Pierre, the Cha-cha-cha was added to make the five Latin American dances which are still the basis of teaching and competition today.

On Pierre's death in 1963, his colleague Doris Nichols commented:
"The Latin American dancing world was so influenced, fostered and built up by him that the names of 'Pierre' and 'Latin American' became virtually synonymous".

Occupational Safety and Health

Occupational Health and Safety is a set of laws that have been made to protect the health and the safety of people when they are working. Health and safety rules will vary a lot from one country to another. Some countries have very strict rules. Rules about Health and Safety have been made since 1950 when the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) agreed about standards of health in the workplace.

Health and safety laws will deal with such things as: the temperature in the workplace (it must not be too hot or too cold), things on the floor that people could fall over, or things that could catch on their clothing and cause an accident, smoking in the workplace and other things that might cause pollution or which might be fire hazards, how many toilets per person there should be, whether they need safety equipment (e.g. hard hats in case anything falls on their heads), whether it is safe for a person to be left alone in the workplace, the rights of disabled people, how many hours in the day people can work for etc etc.

Businesses that do not obey health and safety regulations may be punished (e.g. with a fine or forced to close), or they may be held responsible if there is an accident.

In the European Union, member states have authorities which make sure that people obey the health and safety laws. In the UK, health and safety legislation is made by the Health and Safety Executive and local authorities (the local council) under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974.

In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 created both the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). 

No one can ever be said to be absolutely safe, and employers have to fill in “risk assessments” (UK) or “hazard assessments” (USA) to show they have done everything they can to make things safe.

Currently a user only needs to be here 4 days and he gets autoconfirmed. Does consensus support increasing this to 4 days/10 edits (requires a dev to change)? () 21:02, 10 July 2010 (UTC)
I reopened the bug since it has been more than seven days now. —

I know many people will strongly oppose this idea, but I've thought about this for a long time and I'm pretty sure it will be an immense help in the long run to Simple.

Currently, at , it specifies that as we are an "encyclopedia", we cannot address our readers as "you", or ourselves as "we". No doubt this is all very neat and professional, and very proper, and very dignified: but it is not "simple". In truth, it's really hard to read. When I first came here and tried reading through our VGAs, I was a little surprised at how "complex" these Simple Wikipedia articles were. In almost all the children's books I have looked through, they address people as "you". And while I know this encyclopedia isn't just for children, a foreigner or a person who has difficulty with the English language would indeed probably prefer "you" for reading. It makes it simpler, easier, more entertaining and "readable".

Please think this through carefully. :) Though certainly, this may make our encyclopedia a little less traditional, I'm sure it would make it simpler and easier—and isn't that the whole goal of this wiki? Kindly, — 07:50, 11 July 2010 (UTC)

Just because we're using 'you' doesn't mean it can have more assumptions than simply saying 'people' or 'human body'. For instance, saying 'humans use legs for getting around' assumes that the reader has legs when he or she could have broken them and is using a wheelchair (oh, I know, this is a horrible example, I'll try to find a better if I can). :) And EhJJ: I know swimming probably isn't always good for your body, it's just a fictional example. ;) As in all things, 'you' should be used with common sense, and if used with discretion, I can't see any great problems arising from it. Sincerely, — 09:03, 12 July 2010 (UTC)
I agree with what EhJJ is trying to say here. I, would, however like to draw attention to this statement by Brett (Professor of English for Academic Purposes and TESL at Humber College in Ontario, Canada). In it he states a case for the use of second person. Obviously, there is a difference between a dictionary and an encyclopedia, but I agree with him that language students do tend to find the third person confusing. As I said ealier, they is probably times when second person makes sense here and times when only third person will do. 11:15, 15 July 2010 (UTC)

I would link to implement a small change to the Flagicon template, and its supporting template, Country flagicon2. The flag template system has the ability to define and call variants of country flags, such as historical or military versions. The current templates do not handle this function correctly. I have made updated versions of the templates that display the correct flag version. I have tested them out on several articles, and have found no problems. 

Because this proposed change affect will several hundred articles, I would like some peer review, and to give advance warning if and when the change is implemented.

I have gone through all the calls to flagicon that I can find, and corrected and potential errors. The only think I cannot check is templates that call flagicon with a pass through a parameter.

The one most likely error that will result with this change will be a Flagicon call that used to work, but now produces a red-link. This will happen when a non-standard format of the country name is used, and a redirect template has not been created for the non-standard name. For example, the country Bahamas is often referred to as the Bahamas. 

This is an example.
There a two choices to correct the error.

In some of cases, special redirects or coding kludges have been used to display historical flag. For example: codice_2 creates codice_3 by default, because their is no matching template. Commons redirects that request to codice_4, the desired flag.
Test it yourself!
To test an article to see if it might produce an error, open the edit window, and replace all occurrences of codice_5 with codice_6. Preview the article, and look for any red-links to Country data ... templates.
The test versions of the templates and test articles are in my user namespace, and the table below will provide easy links to check them out.

Recently, I changed one of the bare url links in an article to the template, and another administrator undid my change, kindly telling me that citeweb templates are only used in references. This made me a little puzzled: I know the English Wikipedia doesn't citeweb their "other websites", but I've also seen many users advocate citeweb templates for the "other websites" section in and processes. For example, City of Manchester Stadium and Hurricane Vince (2005), both Very Good Articles, citeweb their "other websites" section. Could someone be so good as to tell me if there's a community consensus for this? :) Thank you, — 09:28, 21 July 2010 (UTC)

There is a proposal to move the page. () 07:03, 18 July 2010 (UTC)
Here's the argument for moving:

Often, it is good to have a review of what led to a situation such as we have had over the Lincoln debacle (or Lincolngate): a remarkably silly thing to get so worked up over. I think that the real tragedy here was that the situation need never have occurred. The wiki basically saw this fiasco happen but with few exceptions little was done to have sessioned editors intervene earlier on and prevent what has occurred. We've got 1 person warned, 2 people blocked and a desysopping that's still ongoing. Steps could have been taken by neutral and respected people (not just admins). A firm set of warnings (not templates), with a zero tolerance attitude to violations of the , esp CIVIL and POV. There is a penchant for the odd drama here, and because we all see each others live activities, it tends to take a big project-wide splash than it would on a much larger project: generally. Anyone who has been here a while and is considered in good standing and respected by the community can informally mediate a dispute. Just focus on the facts, the rules (including IAR), and nip violations of NPOV and CIVIL in the bud early. Read on enwiki; the spirit of it, is sorely needed here on simplewiki. So, when we see discussion that is going wildly down the wrong path, let's step in sooner from now on please. Thanks for reading, ... 10:45, 20 July 2010 (UTC)
<-Checked my logs: At 1702, fr33k said that he "was working on it" At 1713, fr33k told admins to "leave it to me". Goblin was an uninvolved (at the time) administrator, and since we are supposed to trust admins, I left it to him. When the situation began to escalate (about 1700), fr33k took over. Looking over the events, there was no reason for another admin to intercede prior to 1700 and it never happened. As I've said elsewhere, Goblin shouldn't be an admin, and this is the type of thing that happens when you put users like this in situations like this. Both PBP and Goblin had issues, but in the end, the admin should be de-escalating, not escalating. When Goblin didn't do so, appropriate action by fr33k was taken. I see nothing more that could have been done. It is unfortunate that it would turn out this way, but I never expect this to happen again. () 22:20, 20 July 2010 (UTC)

Hello. I was wondering, are IP addresses ever unblocked? Most sysops set most IP Address blocks at "indefinite". Account creation is also blocked.
Can't IP address be banned for a limited time, and be given a second chance? I'm sure many users who were banned would like the opportunity for a change (if it was their fault) or to edit to Wikipedia (if it hasn't been done before). It may invite vandals, but it may also invite IP users to create accounts and/or make useful edits to Wikipedia. Can something be done? 22:16, 22 July 2010 (UTC)

Isn't this a Simple English Wikipedia? If so, why are there so many french-stubs lying around? 22:31, 22 July 2010 (UTC)

People, can't we simply use this noticeboard for useful things? Such threads only make more problems than they solve. There is nothing that needs to be discussed here. Such threads do not help our Wikipedia to become a better place! Please don't start such useless threads, do something else instead. Thanks, - 10:29, 23 July 2010 (UTC)

The Three Caballeros

The Three Caballeros is a 1944 animated movie produced by Walt Disney and distributed by RKO Radio Pictures. The movie premiered in Mexico City on December 21, 1944. It was released in the United States on February 3, 1945. The seventh animated movie in the Disney animated features canon, it shows an adventure through parts of Latin America, combining live-action and animation. This is the second of the Disney package movies of the 1940s.

The movie is made up as a series of self-contained segments, strung together by the device of Donald Duck opening birthday gifts from his Latin American friends. Several Latin American stars of the movie's time appear, including singers Aurora Miranda (sister of Carmen Miranda) and Dora Luz, as well as dancer Carmen Molina. It again starred Donald Duck, who in the course of the movie is joined by old friend José Carioca, the cigar-smoking parrot from "Saludos Amigos" (1942) representing Brazil, and later makes a new friend, a rooster, Panchito Pistoles, representing Mexico.

The music of the Mexican part of the movie was written by Mexican composer Manuel Esperon, who wrote the score for over 540 Mexican movies in the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema. Walt Disney, after having seen his success in the Mexican movie industry, called him personally to ask him to participate in the movie. The main song for the Mexican part is "Ay Jalisco, No Te Rajes!", one of Esperon's most famous songs. The movie received two Academy Award nominations for Original Music Score and Best Sound.

It is Donald Duck's birthday. He receives three presents. The first present is a movie projector, which shows him a documentary on birds. The next present is a book given to Donald by Jose Carioca himself. This book takes them to Bahia. The third present is a piñata given to Donald by Panchito Pistoles. In the piñata, there are many surprises. The celebration ends with Donald Duck being fired away by firecrackers in the shape of a bull (the firecrackers are lit by Jose with his cigar).

Throughout the movie, we see a voiceless character called the Aracuan Bird at random moments. He usually bothers everyone, sometimes stealing Jose's cigar. His most famous gag is when he re-routes the train by drawing new tracks. He returns three years later in Disney's "Melody Time".

Protocarnivorous plant

A protocarnivorous plant is a plant that traps small animals (usually insects and arthropods) much like carnivorous plants do. Unlike carnivorous plants, these plants cannot get the nutritients from the trapped prey, though. The mechanisms of trapping are very similar to those developed by carnivorous plants. The problem is also one of definitions, as people do not agree what makes a "carnivorous plant".

A Pineapple cake is a cake containing pineapples. It also includes the ingredients of cherries and pecan halves. It is also known as the Pineapple up-side down cake. This name is because the pineapples are on the bottom of the cake when it is cooked, but it is flipped upside down, showing the pineapples.

Nobody knows the exact history of pineapple cakes. Cookbooks and magazines published in the United States prove that pineapple was a very popular ingredient in the 1920s.

Early Europeans commonly called any kind of fruit an apple, and that is why the Spanish thought pineapples looked like pine cones. Pineapples have nothing to do with pine cones and apples, but because of the similar shape between the pineapple and the pine cone, most people change it into symbolism. Both have been used for symbolizing fertility. The pineapple symbolized friendship and hospitality to the Caribs. These people usually hung pineapples outside their huts to show their welcome.

Basic usage of the main flag templates.

The template will display two things. An icon (a small image) of a flag, and a wikilink to the article (page) of the country. The name of the country is the first parameter passed to the template.
The template will display an icon (a small image) of a flag. The name of the country is the first parameter passed to the template.

In en:wikipedia, the flag icon is a wikilink to the article about the country. In simple:wikipedia, the flag icon is a wikilink to the full-sized image on wikimedia commons.
The template does the same thing as 
The template will an icon of a flag, and a wikilink to the article (page) of the country. The display format is the same as , but the common name of the country is used, even if an alternate name or code is used (see Alternate names below). The name of the country is the first parameter passed to the template.
Many countries have individual flag templates. These are shortcut flag templates. The template is named using standard three-letter country code. This is a "shortcut" to using the standard Flagicon template.

There are good things and bad things about using the shortcut flag templates. 

See for a complete list.

The first parameter for the , , and templates is the country name to be used for the flag image. These country names identify "additional" templates that store information about that country. For example, the image name and main article name used by codice_1 (to produce ) is stored in . The complete set of these "country data" templates is found in .

For this discussion, all areas will be called countries. 

There are also "country data templates" for entities that are not considered "countries". These other entities can be things such as international organizations, multi-national organizations, state names, province names, or territory names. The use of "country" in these template names is because the wikicode of the flag template system was built upon . The flag template system was expanded to include these other entities, so the "country" name had to be used.

Some examples of non-country flag templates are:

Many country data templates also have historical nations. These templates may be used to display the historical flags with wikilinks to the appropriate articles. Some examples are:

To make writing wikicode for the flag templates easier, many flags can be identified by an "alias name". This alias name is typically a three-letter country code. 

Alias names are available for almost every nation listed in ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 (the international list of country codes), the list of IOC country codes, and the list of FIFA country codes. For example, codice_1 and codice_1 both produce .

A small group of other well-known abbreviations are also available (such as codice_22 for the United Kingdom, codice_23 for the European Union, and codice_24 for the Soviet Union.

To find the country code aliases for a country, look at the Country data template for that country. For example, has a section named Redirect aliases. In that secton, the codes DEU and GER are listed. These are the country code aliases that may be used to display the German flag.

When using country code aliases, template will display the country code for the wikilink text. For example:

Note that in each case, the target wikilink is the correct article (i.e. United States, United Kingdom, and People's Republic of China, respectively). This may be the desired effect, such as in column headings of a large table, but if the full name is wanted, then use instead. This feature is not function at the current time.


Many countries have had different flags in their history. The flag template system can store many flag variants (different versions) inside country data templates. A flag variant is selected by adding an additional parameter to the standard flag templates. This parameter is usually given as the second parameter to the template, but may also be given as the codice_31 named parameter.


The flag variants (if any) for a country are documented on the country data template page itself. Each variant is identified by a label, such as codice_36 or codice_37 in the examples above. Usually, the label identifies the year in which the flag was first used, but this is not a requirement.

The normal size for all flag icons is 22x20px, with a one pixel border. This means that the flag icon will be no more than 22 pixels wide, and no more than 20 pixels tall. Most flags have a horizontal layout (they are wider than they are tall). For these flags the 22 pixel width limits the icon size. This size was picked to display the best looking flag icons for most uses.

Sometimes, it might be better to display a larger or smaller icon. To change the flag icon size, use the codice_38 parameter. Enter the size followed by the letters px. The size my be the maximum width and or height of the icon.


The text of the wikilink is usually generated by the template, but can always be changed with the codice_42 parameter.


The template is similar to codice_45, but it adds to the the wikilink by adding a suffix after the country name. This is useful when a series of per-country articles exist for a main topic.

 template is used to display the army flag of a country. The army flag is coded in the "country data template". The link to the country's article for their army is also coded in the "country data template". 

 template is used to display the air force flag of a country. The air force flag is coded in the "country data template". The link to the country's article for their air force is also coded in the "country data template". 

 template is used to display the naval ensign of a country. The naval ensign is coded in the "country data template". The link to the country's article for their navy is also coded in the "country data template". 
A common use of the flag icon templates on Wikipedia is for national sport teams. Several sets of sport-specific templates have been built into the flag template system:


These templates have short names because they are often used many times on one page. There are often several template in a set used for a given sport:

For example, for football, the following templates are used:

If a users would not like to see the flag icons displayed, they can disable them. A CSS class is used within the internal formatting template, and the class setting can be changed from a user's personal file.

Bread roll

A bread roll is a piece of bread, usually small and round and is usually a side dish. Bread rolls are most times used in the same way as sandwiches are - cut in half, with items like butter placed between the two halves.

There are many names for bread rolls, especially in local versions of British English. These were named depending on how the dough was made and how the roll was cooked. Over time, most people started using one name to call all equal products regardless of whether it is right or not.

Bread rolls are common in Europe, mostly in Germany and Austria. They are also common in both Australia and New Zealand, and very common in Canada. In Germany and Austria, there is a large variety of bread rolls, ranging from white rolls made with wheat flour, to dark rolls containing mostly rye flour. Many variants include spices, such as coriander and cumin, nuts, or seeds, such as sesame seeds, poppy seed or sunflower seeds.</br>

An Italian form of bread roll is a small loaf of ciabatta which can be used to make a "panino" (or "panini"). In Denmark and Norway, rolls are called "rundstykker" (literally "round pieces") and are comfort food eaten with butter for special weekend breakfasts.

Jive (dance)

Jive is a dance, one of the five International Latin ballroom dances. It originated in the United States from African-Americans in the early 1940s. It is a lively and uninhibited variation of the earlier forms of Swing dance such as the Jitterbug.

Jive is danced in 4/4 time, and in competition at a speed of 44 bars per minute. It differs from Rock 'n Roll (dance) in having a syncopated (chassé). Steps are counted 1, 2, 3 & 4, with 3 & 4 as the chassé.

American soldiers brought Lindy Hop/Jitterbug to Europe around 1942, where this dance quickly became popular among the young. In the United States the term 'Swing' became the most common word used to describe the dance. In the UK variations in technique led to styles such as Boogie-Woogie and Swing Boogie, with 'Jive' gradually emerging as the generic term.

After the war, the boogie became the dominant form for popular music. It was, however, never far from criticism as a foreign, vulgar dance. The famous ballroom dancing guru, Alex Moore, said that he had "never seen anything uglier". English instructors developed the elegant and lively ballroom Jive, danced to slightly slower music. In 1968 it was adopted as the fifth Latin dance in International competitions. The modern form of ballroom jive in the 1990s-present, is a very happy and boppy dance, the lifting of knees and the bending or rocking of the hips often occurs.

The basic step (Jive Basic) is a six beat pattern, comprising eight weight changes.

A dirge is a sad song or poem of unhappiness. They are usually sung at funerals. For example, a dirge was sung for the soldiers that had died in the Battle of Gettysburg before Abraham Lincoln delivered his Gettysburg Address. The word "dirge" came from the Latin word "dirige", which means "direct". It is likely that "dirge" also came from the old expression "Dirige, Domine, Deus meus, in conspectu tuo viam meam" ("Direct my way in your sight, O Lord my God"). "Dirge", meaning "to direct", is the same as a "dirigible" ("steerable") airship. These two words became connected in 1937 because of the Hindenburg disaster.

A kind of benediction that is often done in both Roman Catholic and Protestant churches is for the worship leader to raise his hands and say the Biblical Priestly Blessing (). This was made popular by Martin Luther in his Deutsche Messe (German Mass). It is a tradition in most Lutheran Churches. F. Scott Fitzgerald also wrote a short story called "Benediction" in 1920.

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is a guide to grouping mental disorders. It is published by the American Psychiatric Association. It is used in the United States and around the world by doctors, researchers, health insurance companies, companies which make medicine, and others.

There have been five revisions since it was first published in 1952. Each time, more mental disorders were added, although some have been removed and are no longer seen as mental disorders.

The manual was developed from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, and from a manual written by the US Army. A lot of changes were made to it in 1980. The last time it was greatly changed was the fourth edition ("DSM-IV"), published in 1994, but small changes to text were made in a 2000 version. The fifth edition ("DSM-5") is currently being prepared, and it is planned to be finished in May 2013.

The performing arts include theatre/drama, music, opera, and dance, mime and pantomime. Stand-up comedy, oratory, debate are also performing arts. The term also includes all of the various elements, and variations of the foregoing, such as oral interpretation, marching band, and so on.

An artist who practices one or more performing arts is called a "performer". Common occupational titles include actor, comedian, singer, dancer, musician, orator, and so on.

Performing arts

The performing arts are those forms of art in which individual people perform separately or together. The artist's own body, face, and presence is needed for the performance.

Performance art differs from the plastic arts, which use materials such as clay, metal or paint which can be moulded or transformed. A plastic art produces some physical art object. The term 'performing arts' first appeared in the English language in the year 1711.

Performing arts include the dance, music, opera, drama, magic, oratory and circus arts.

Artists who participate in performing arts in front of an audience are called performers, including actors, comedians, dancers, magicians, musicians, and singers. Performing arts are also supported by workers in related fields, such as songwriting and stagecraft.

Performers often adapt their appearance, such as with costumes and stage makeup, etc.

There is also a specialized form of fine art in which the artists "perform" their work live to an audience. This is called performance art. Most performance art also involves some form of plastic art, perhaps in the creation of props. Dance was often referred to as a "plastic art" during the Modern dance era.

Music focuses on three career paths, music performance, music education, and musicology (theory, history, etc.). Students learn to play musical instrument, but also study music theory, musicology, history of music and musical composition. In the arts tradition, music is also used to broaden skills of non-musicians by teaching skills such as concentration and listening.

Drama (Greek 'to do', 'seeing place') is the branch of the performing arts concerned with acting out stories in front of an audience. It uses speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle—indeed any one or more elements of the other performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style of plays, theatre takes such forms as musicals, opera, ballet, illusion, mime, Indian dance, kabuki, mummers' plays, stand-up comedy, pantomime, and non-conventional or arthouse theatre.

Dance (from Old French "dancier") generally refers to human movement either used as a form of expression or in a social, spiritual or performance setting.

'Dance' is also used to describe methods of non-verbal communication (see body language) between humans or animals (bee dance, mating dance), motion in inanimate objects ("the leaves danced in the wind"), and certain music genres.

Choreography is the art of making dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer.

The definition of what is dance depends on society, and ranges from folk dance) to codified, virtuoso techniques such as ballet. In sports, rhythmic gymnastics, figure skating, ice dancing and synchronized swimming are "dance" disciplines. Some martial arts have dance-like moves.

Starting in the 6th century BC, the first reorded performing art began in Ancient Greece, ushered in by the tragic poets such as Sophocles. These poets wrote plays which, in some cases, incorporated dance (see Euripides). This Hellenistic period began the widespread use of comedy.

However by the 6th century AD, Western performing arts had been largely ended, as the Dark Ages began. Between the 9th century and 14th century, performing art in the West was limited to religious historical enactments and morality plays, organized by the Church in celebration of holy days and other important events.

Albert Roussel

Albert Charles Paul Marie Roussel (5 April 1869 - 23 August 1937) was a French composer. Roussel spent seven years as a midshipman. He only turned to music as an adult. But he then became one of the most unique French composers of the inter-war time. His earlier music came from the impressionism of Debussy and Ravel. He turned more towards neoclassicism with his later music.

Albert was born in Tourcoing ("Nord" "department" of France). Roussel's earliest interest was not music. It was mathematics. He spent some time in the French Navy. In 1889 and 1890 he served on the crew of the frigate "Iphigénie". These travels made him more like an artist. This is because many of his musical works would reflect his interest in far off and interesting places.

After Roussel stopped working with the Navy in 1894, he began to study music with Eugène Gigout. Albert continued his studies until 1908 at the Schola Cantorum (one of his teachers there was Vincent d'Indy). While he studied, he would also also teach. His fellow students were Erik Satie and the young Edgard Varèse.

During World War I, he served as an ambulance driver on the Western Front. After the war, he bought a summer house in Normandy. This is where he gave most of his time to composing music.

Roussel was a classicist. Some of his first works are very much like impressionism. But he soon found a style fit just for him. This style was more normal in design. It had a strong rhythmic sound. It also seemed to be more like functional tonality than is clear in the work of his more famous works. 

The Schola Cantorum left a mark on Roussel's mature style. Compared with the style of other French composers like Gabriel Fauré or Claude Debussy, Roussel's orchestration is kind of heavy. His style and musical beauty of so-called "French" music was his own. No one else really had it. Roussel never copied any of the Teutonic style.

Roussel also liked jazz. He wrote a piano-vocal composition called "Jazz dans la nuit". This is almost the same by its inspiration to other jazz works such as "Blues" second movement of Maurice Ravel's "Violin Sonata". 

Roussel's most important works are the ballets. They are "Le festin de l'araignée", "Bacchus et Ariane", and "Aeneas". Other good works are the four symphonies. His other works are manys ballets, a piano concerto, a concertino for cello and orchestra, a psalm setting for chorus and orchestra, minor music for the theater, solo piano music, and songs. He died in the town of Royan in western France in 1937. That is the same year that his countrymen Maurice Ravel and Gabriel Pierné died.

Arturo Toscanini included the suite from the ballet "Le festin de l'araignée" in one of his concerts with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Georges Prêtre recorded this same music with the "Orchestre National de France" for EMI in 1984.

Heidi Montag

Heidi Montag (born September 15, 1986 in Colorado, United States) is a television personality, model and singer. She starred in MTV series "The Hills".

Heidi was born on September 15, 1986 in Colorado. She has an older sister, Holly Montag (born 1983). She graduated from high school and after that, attended the Academy of Art University in California.

Montag had a regular role on a reality series called "The Hills", from 2005 until 2010. She appeared on "The Hills" because she was the friend and roommate of the show's main star, Lauren Conrad.

During "The Hills", she started dating Spencer Pratt. She later married him, but the other people on "The Hills", especially Conrad, hated Pratt. Because of this, Montag and Pratt became portrayed as "the villains" of the series.
Montag and Pratt were removed from "The Hills" in 2010. This was after Pratt had told one of the producers that he would kill him. Pratt was ordered to take anger management classes, but even after that, they wouldn't rehire him and his wife.

Montag started working on her own music album in 2007. In 2009, she performed her song "Body Language" on the Miss Universe show in the Bahamas. Her performance was disliked by critics and many other people. 
She released her debut album in 2010. It was called "Superficial" and it sold only 1,000 copies in it's first week. It received negative reviews. Despite all the negative reactions, Montag has said that she will release another album.

In 2008, Montag debuted her first fashion collection, Heidiwood, in Los Angeles. She later designed more clothes.

Montag will have a small role in a comedic movie, "Just Go With It!" in 2010. The film also stars Jennifer Aniston.

Heidi Montag and her boyfriend Spencer Pratt had an on/off relationship for two years. In 2008, they married in Mexico. They married a second time in California. Only the second time was legal.

In 2010, Montag filed for divorce. Tabloid magazines and others suggested that this was fake, because the couple were still seen together in public. They told press that they were on "friendly terms" but still divorcing. It is thought that they will be legally divorced in 2011.

Montag has made headlines for her plastic surgery. She has underwent nose correction, chin correction, suction of fat off her hips, many others and best known, a breast enlargement.
In 2010, she had ten surgeries in one day, which almost killed her. Montag "upgraded" her breasts to the maximum size. Later, after her surgeries, she said that she couldn't live with the size of her breasts, and wants to have them reduced back.

<doc id="255774" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=255774" title="Veil">
Veil

A veil is a soft covering of all or part of the face. It has often been used by women in many cultures. It is often used by brides on their wedding day. It may have religious meaning, or it may be used for pleasure or dance. It is different from a mask because a mask is close-fitting, and often firm or hard, while a veil is soft and may fit loosely.

Veils are a kind of non-verbal communication. They always have some kind of unspoken message.

Some kinds of veil include a hood which covers the entire head, like a hijab. The point of covering the head entirely is to cover all parts which have any sexual meaning. A woman's hair is one of her secondary sexual characteristics, and acts (with her face, body and personality) to attract the opposite sex. Some religious groups believe that female sexuality should not be shown in public.

The most important part of the head (for the viewer) is the face, because the human face takes part in communication. Covering it says, in effect, 'this person is not available'. That is why it has been used so often by women. Because it is of soft material, the veil may be lifted back over the head or unclipped from one side. This is also a signal. It says 'now I am available'. So brides lift their veil at the point when they are married.

Veils may be, and often are, partly transparent. This adds ambiguity and mystery to the 'message' it offers the viewer; it is a 'fashion statement'. The raising or dropping of veils is a sign of intimacy: the wearer, who was covered, is now in the open. Extreme example: Salome and the (fictional) dance of the seven veils.

French Island (Victoria)

French Island is a large island located in Western Port, Victoria, Australia. It is 61 km southeast of Melbourne. In 1997 about 70 per cent of the island was made the French Island National Park. It has also been listed as part of the National Estate. In 2002, the waters on the north coast were made into the French Island Marine National Park.

Even though it is close to Melbourne, French Island is relatively isolated and undeveloped. There is no water or electricity supply, or medical services on the island. There is one small shop and post office on Tankerton Road about 3 km from Tankerton Jetty. There is a number of places to stay, including camping, bed and breakfasts, guest houses, and the McLeod Eco Farm which was once a prison.

An Australian aboriginal tribal song says the Bunarong Tribe lived and hunted on French Island, until they were killed by a warring Gippsland tribe. The first Europeans to discover the island were the French in April 1802. A group from the ship, "La Naturaliste", explored the area naming it "Île de Françoise", (French Island).
In 1847 the first settlers, William and John Gardner, started farming on the island. In the 1880's, koalas were released on to the island. In the 1890's the government set up several small villages. Farmers began to grow chicory, and about 30 chicory kilns were built.

On July 17, 1916 the McLeod Prison Farm opened and continued until 1975. In 1967, the State Electricity Commission (SEC)wanted to build the first nuclear power plant in Australia on French Island

Tankerton Post Office opened on 3 September 1890 and closed in 1994. It reopened in 2001 under the name French Island. A Fairhaven office was also open from 1911 until 1957.

In 1967, the SEC told the Lands Department to keep 400 acres of French Island for future construction of a nuclear power plant. The plant, to be built in the 1970's, would generate 350-500MW of electricity. More nuclear power plants would be built in Australia once there was a successful, fully operational plant in Victoria. The SEC also planned to build more brown coal power stations as well.

Due to the low cost of brown coal in Victoria and pressure from the anti-nuclear movement, the SEC decided not to build a nuclear plant and instead continued to build brown coal plants. These included the Hazelwood Power Station, which was completed in 1971. Nuclear plants were not built in New South Wales, as access to black coal allowed for bigger generators. The declaration of various areas of many Australian states as nuclear free zones was a key factor in the selection of coal plants over nuclear plants.

There is easy access to the island by train and ferry. People can take a train from Melbourne to Frankston. From Frankston there is a diesel locomotive service to Stony Point. It is a short walk along the jetty to catch the passenger ferry to Tankerton jetty on French Island. It is also possible to catch a passenger ferry from Cowes on Phillip Island.

Important features are Mount Wellington which is 96m in height and the Pinnacles at 66m.

In 2006 there were 89 people living on French Island. In 2009,there were five students at the primary school. 

Habitats range from coastal mangroves, swamps, heath, grasslands and blue gum forests. Most koalas on the mainland of Australia suffer from the chlamydia disease. French Island provides the world's most dense and disease free group of koalas. They are often moved to repopulate diseased areas on the mainland. Shelter is provided for more than 100 species of bush orchids, and 260 species of birds. Significant species on the island include: King Quail, the critically endangered Orange-bellied Parrot, Fairy Tern, White-bellied Sea Eagle, Swamp Skink, Long-nosed Potoroo.
The island is one of only two places in Victoria where there are no foxes. Because of this, the island has kept a variety of native species which have been devastated by the fox in other areas. However rabbits, feral cats, feral goats, feral pigs, Indian Mynahs and starlings pose a threat to the island's biodiversity.

As the only cars used on the island are by residents, the network of more than 40 km of gravel roads and tracks are quiet and ideal for cycling. The island is generally flat or mildly undulating with the highest point being Mt Wellington (96 m). Bicycles can be hired from the General Store, Macleod Eco Farm and Bayview. There are many walking tracks. Other activities include bushwalking, bird watching, horse riding, cycling, and as a base for deep sea fishing. 

Two local tour companies, French Island Tours and French Island Eco Tours, can provide bus tours of the island.

There is one free camping site in the National Park at Fairhaven, 4 km up the coast road from Tankerton Jetty, where the ferry arrives from Stony Point. The camp site is set among trees near the beach, with one public toilet and a water tank. Other camping is available at "private sites" at Bayview and McLeod Eco Farm by arrangement.

Eurovision Song Contest 2011

The 56 Annual Eurovision Song Contest was held in Düsseldorf (Germany), due to Germany's first place with their singer Lena Meyer-Landrut with her song ""Satellite"" in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Oslo (Norway). Like previous years, a system of two semi-finals was introduce : the first on 10 May and the second on 13 May 2011. The final is planned for the evening of 14 May 2011. The winners were Ell & Nikki with their song Running scard, they represented Azerbaijan.

On 12 October 2010, the German broadcaster, Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) announced that the Esprit Arena of Düsseldorf as the venue of the Eurovision Song Contest 2011. Germany has already held the Eurovision Song Contest. The first in 1957 in Frankfurt am Main and the second in 1983 in Munich. Since 1998 and the victory of the United Kingdom the year before, it is the first time that a country of the "Big Five" (Germany, France, Spain, United Kingdom & Italy (since 2011)) will held the Eurovision Song Contest.

23 cities of Germany participated to the bidding phase of the venue for the 56 Annual Eurovision Song Contest. Eight cities showed interest of hosting the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 : Berlin, Hamburg, Hanover, Gelsenkirchen, Düsseldorf, Cologne, Frankfurt, Munich. On 21 August 2010, NDR announced that four of those cities had officially applied to host the 2011 Contest : 

The five countries that are part of the "Big Five", along with the host of the contest, automatically qualify for a place in the final. But Germany is both the host of the 2011 edition and a member from the "Big Five". To answer this question of if a country will qualify directly for the final (maybe the second of the 2010 Contest), the EBU held a meeting in Belgrade (Serbia). And it was decided that the existing rules will remain in place, and that the number of participants in the final will simply decreased from twenty-five to twenty-four. On 31 December 2010, the EBU published the official list of the participants for the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest and which stated the return of Italy, Austria, San Marino and Hungary. And thanks to the return of Italy twenty-fiv countries will participate for the final of the 2011 edition of the Eurovision Song Contest.

On 16 December 2010, NDR revealed the presenters of the 2011 edition : Anke Engelke, Judith Rakers, and Stefan Raab. It will be the third time that three people have hosted the contest after 1999 and 2010. And the second time in a row.

To determine the semi-final running orders for the Eurovision Song Contest, participating nations were split into six pots on 17 January 2011. Countries has been drawn from each pot to determine if they will compete in either the first or second semi-final and like in 2010, it will determine in which half of the semi-final they will perform, in order for delegations to know when rehearsals will begin for their respective countries. The draw also determine in which semi-finals the members of the "Big Five" (France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and Italy) will be able to vote. 

Israeli broadcaster IBA requested to take part in the second semi-final due to the Israeli Memorial Day, which will be held during the first semi-final. German broadcaster NDR also requested that they be allowed to vote in the second semi-final for scheduling reasons.

On 31 December 2010, the EBU confirmed the forty-three countries which will be competing fir the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest. The 2011 edition which will mark the returns of Austria, which last participated in 2007, Italy, which last participated in 1997, San Marino, which only took part in 2008, and Hungary, which last participated in 2009.

At a meeting in Belgrade, the EBU decided that the countries has to choose their artists and their songs before 14 March because the running draw for the Eurovision Song Contest will be held on March 15.

Keynesian economics

Keynesian economics (Keynesianism) describes the economics theories from famous economist John Maynard Keynes.

Keynes believed that capitalism was a good economic system, but sometimes, when the economy becomes bad, the government should step in and do something about it.

When the economy is bad, people tend to save their money instead of spend it, and in result there is less economic activity. 

Keynes believed that the government should spend a lot of money (even if it has to borrow the money and go into debt) to create jobs for unemployed people, and then those people would spend their money, which would create more jobs and get the economy's motor running again.

Some people such as conservatives, libertarians, and people who believe in Austrian economics are against Keynesian economics because they believe the economy can recover on its own without government intervention.

During the late 1970's Keynesian economics became less popular because inflation was high. 

When a big recession happened in 2007, Keynesian economics became more popular. Leaders around the world (including Barack Obama) created stimulus packages which would allow their government to spend a lot of money to create jobs.

Many economists such as Paul Krugman believe in Keynesian economics.

Elam was an long-lasting ancient civilization just to the east of Mesopotamia, in what is now southwest Iran. Elam was centered in the far west and the southwest of modern-day Iran, including a small part of southern Iraq.

Knowledge of Elamite history remains largely fragmentary, reconstruction being based on mainly Mesopotamian sources. The history of Elam is conventionally divided into three periods, spanning more than two millennia. The period before the first Elamite period is known as the proto-Elamite period:

The Proto-Elamite city of Susa was founded around 5000 BCE in the watershed of the river Karun. It is considered to be the site of Proto-Elamite cultural formation. 

Written records start from around 3000 BC in the Old Elamite period (Middle Bronze Age). In the Achaemenid Empire the Elamite language was among those in official use. The Elamite language has no obvious connections with any other, and seems to be a language isolate like Sumerian. Some researchers have suggested the existence of a larger group known as Elamo-Dravidian. This theory is not established.

The Elamites called their country Haltamti, but the Sumerians and Akkadians called it Elam, and so it was also in the Hebrew Bible. The civilisation started around 2700 BC, and they were finally conquered by the Achmaenids in 640 BC. A tablet found in 1848 has the Achmaenid king Ashurbanipal boasting of his conquest:

As it happens, the Elamites managed to stay independent for some time after this disaster. The devastation was less complete than Assurbanipal boasted, and Elamite rule, though rather broken up, continued until 540 BC, when Achaemenid rule begins in Susa. Under the Parthian period, a kingdom of Elymais existed which survived until its extinction by Sassanid invasion in the early third century AD. It was located in the heartland of ancient Elam.

Dental braces

Braces are metal wires that are held together by metal brackets glued to the permanent teeth. Each week or month (or other time the orthodontist decides) the patient comes back and the braces may be checked, cleaned, or changed into a tighter wire. Braces are to make your teeth straight. Not everyone needs or will need braces. Crooked teeth are based on habits, and/or genetics.

2008 Kosovo declaration of independence

The 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence was an act of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government Assembly of Kosovo, adopted on 17 February 2008 by unanimous quorum (109 members present), which declared Kosovo to be independent from Serbia.

It was the second declaration of independence by Kosovo's Albanian-majority political institutions, the first having been proclaimed on 7 September 1990.

Serbia intends to seek international validation and support for its stance that the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence is illegal at the International Court of Justice, after, in October 2008, the United Nations General Assembly approved Serbia's proposal to request an ICJ advisory opinion on the matter, which ruled that Kosovo's declaration of independence did not violate international law.

Following a request from Russia, the United Nations Security Council held an emergency session in the afternoon of 17 February. The United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, issued a statement that avoided taking sides and urged all parties "to refrain from any actions of statements that could endanger peace, incite violence or jeopardize security in Kosovo or the region." Speaking on behalf of six western countries—Belgium, Croatia, France, Germany, Italy and the United States—the Belgian ambassador expressed regret "that the Security Council cannot agree on the way forward, but this impasse has been clear for many months. Today's events... represent the conclusion of a status process that has exhausted all avenues in pursuit of a negotiated outcome." 

On July 22, 2010 the International Court of Justice ruled that the declaration did not violate international law. Prior to the announcement Hashim Thaçi said there would be no "winners or losers" and that "I expect this to be a correct decision, according to the will of Kosovo's citizens. Kosovo will respect the advisory opinion." For his part, Boris Tadić, the Serbian president, warned that "If the International Court of Justice sets a new principle, it would trigger a process that would create several new countries and destabilise numerous regions in the world."

Grupo Santander

Grupo Santander is a banking group centered on Banco Santander, the largest bank in the Eurozone. Grupo Santander is one of the largest banks in the world (in terms of market capitalisation). It originated in Santander, Cantabria, Spain.

Banco Hispanoamericano was created in 1900. Banco Central was created in 1919. Banco Central and Banco Hispanoamericano merged.
Banco Santander was founded in 1857. Banco Central Hispano was founded in 1991. In 1999, Banco Santander and Banco Central Hispano merged, creating Banco Santander Central Hispano, or BSCH.

The 1999 merger between Santander and Central Hispano was designed to be a "merger of equals". The the top executives of the two firms would share control of the new firm. Soon after the merger former Central Hispano executives thought chairman Botin of trying to control the firm. They threatened to take legal action against him. The issue was resolved when Central Hispano the executives agreed to severance payments (money given when leaving a company), retirement. They also turned control of the firm over to Mr. Botin. This action cost the shareholders of the firm €164M.

Because of the large payouts, Mr. Botin was brought to trial on criminal charges of "misappropriation of funds" (using company money the wrong way) and "irresponsible management." In April 2005 he was cleared of all charges. The decision said the retirement payments made were legal, "made as compensation for the services provided to the bank." 

In 2005, Mr. Botin was accused of insider trading (trading stock based on knowledge the general public did not have). The anti-corruption division of the Spanish public prosecutor's office cleared Mr. Botin of all charges.

On 26 July 2004 Banco Santander Central Hispano announced the purchase of Abbey National plc. The shareholders' approved of the purchase, and it was formally approved by the courts. Abbey became part of Grupo Santander on 12 November 2004.

BSCH's offered to purchase 28% of ABN AMRO. The offer would be made by a capital increase through a new stock share issue. In October 2007, the group outbid Barclays and purchased ABN AMRO. As part of the deal, Grupo Santander acquired ABN AMRO's subsidiary in Brazil, Banco Real, and its subsidiary in Italy, Banca Antonveneta.

On 13 August 2007, Banco Santander Central Hispano changed its legal name to Banco Santander.

In November 2007, it sold Banca Antonveneta to Monte dei Paschi di Siena.

These will be integrate into Santander Consumer Finance.

The group announced in July 2008 that it intended to takeover the UK bank Alliance & Leicester. Alliance & Leicester had £24bn in deposits and 254 branches. The purchase was completed in October 2008 when the group removed the company's shares from the London Stock Exchange. This was followed by the purchase of the savings business of UK bank Bradford & Bingley (B&B) in September 2008 B&B had deposits of £22bn, 2.6m customers, 197 branches and 140 agencies. The banks, along with Abbey, are to be merged together under the Santander name in the UK by the end of 2010.

In October 2008, Grupo Santander announced that it would purchase the 75.65% of Sovereign Bancorp it does not currently own. This would cosst approximately US$1.9 billion (€1.4 billion). The purchase of Sovereign has given Santander its first retail bank in the mainland United States.

Grupo Santander has 131,819 employees, 90.1 million customers, 11,178 branches and 2.27 million shareholders. Retail banking - the main part of Santander's operations - generates 82% of the group's profit.

Currently, Santander is a corporate sponsor of the Ferrari Formula One team and the Copa Libertadores de America.

On December 1, 2008, Santander announced that their Formula One sponsorship deal with McLaren will end in 2010, when Santander will become Ferrari's main sponsor. However, in September 2009, Santander announced that it will continue its sponsorship with Vodafone McLaren-Mercedes due to its brand awareness in the UK rising from 20 to 82 percent.

On December 14, 2008, it was revealed that the collapse of Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme might mean the loss of 2.33 billion euros at Banco Santander.

On November 10, 2009, HSBC Finance Corporation announced an agreement with Santander Consumer USA Inc. (SC USA). SC USA would sell HSBC US auto loan processing operations, and US $1 billion in auto loan receivables (money due to be received) for US $904 million in cash.

A canteen is a bottle which can be re-used. Canteens are most used for carrying water to places where water is hard to find. Many canteens can be worn on a belt, or held with a strap, like a purse. They are carried often by soldiers, hikers, and campers. Old canteens were mostly made of metal but newer ones can be made of plastic. The idea of a canteen comes from ancient times when water and wine were carried in bags made from animal skins.

Happy slapping

Happy slapping is a trend in which innocent people are hurt, for no apparent reason. Most of the time, happy slapping is done in groups. One person in the group will hit an innocent person, while another films the onset. In English-speaking countries, the crime is usually deemed assault. In some cases, the victims are beaten to unconsciousness, or even killed. Mostly, the name is used for small acts of violence such as hitting or jumping on the victim, but the media has also used it for more serious crimes such as murder, rape, and sexual assault.

Happy slapping began in South London, particularly the London Borough of Lewisham. The first use was as "Slap Happy TV", where many people would watch and judge the exploit of a happy slapper.

<doc id="256109" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=256109" title="Eni">
Eni

Eni S.p.A. ) is an Italian multinational oil and gas company. Eni is present in 70 countries, and currently is Italy's largest industrial company. It has a market capitalization of € 87.7 billion euros (US$138 billion), as of July 24, 2008. The Italian Government owns a 30% golden share in the company. Golden shares are special stock shares that allow the government to control a company. 20% of the shares are held through the state Treasury and 10% are held through the Cassa depositi e prestiti (a bank mostly owned by the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Italy).

Agip was started in 1926. After World War II, Enrico Mattei was appointed Special Administrator to close down Agip. With the discovery of the Caviaga gas field in the Po Valley, the process of closing Agip was halted. Enrico Mattei converted it to a state monopoly (a company with no competition), and renamed it Eni. Eni comes from the company's original full name "Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi" (National Hydrocarbons Agency). Eni was to supply energy to Italy and contribute to the country's industrial development.

Eni decided that natural gas would supply the energy needed from the crisis of the 1973 oil embargo. They import gas from the Soviet Union and the Netherlands. Snam started the Transmediterranean pipeline, moving gas from the Hassi-R-Mel field in Algeria to the Po Valley. The gas pipeline was more than 2,500 km or 1550 miles long. It started in the Algerian desert and crosses Tunisia. It then crosses the Sicilian Channel at a water depth of over 650 metres or 2100 feet. Next it goes through Sicily and up the length of the entire Italian peninsula.

In the 1990s, Eni changed from a public corporation into a joint stock company. Most of Eni's share capital was put on the market in four successive public issues. Agip's international work increased with new acquisitions in Algeria, China, Angola, the North Sea and Egypt. New agreements were signed with Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and for the Nigerian and Angolan deep water oil. Eni incorporated Agip, and became an oil and gas producer. Eni's daily oil and gas production reached the equivalent of 1 million barrels of oil.

Eni operates in the exploration (searching) and production of hydrocarbons (oil and natural gas) in Italy, North Africa, West Africa, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and Australia. It also operates in areas with great potential to produce oil such as the Caspian Sea, the Middle and Far East, India and Alaska.

Its crude oil production comes primarily from Libya, Egypt, Nigeria, the Congo, the North Sea, and Angola. Smaller amounts of crude oil production come from Tunisia and in the United States. Eni's China production began in 1992, but it is only 1 percent of Eni's total crude oil production.

Eni supplies natural gas. Gas sales reached 99 billion cubic meters in 2007.
In June 2008 the company bought 57% of Distrigas, a Belgian company that supplies natural gas. In March 2009 it bought the rest of Distrigas. As of June 30, 2009 Distrigas is a fully owned subsidiary of Eni.

Eni's generates electricity in Italy, using both natural gas and solar power.

Eni operates Saipem, a subsidiary, and owns 43% of the company. Saipem works in engineering, and oilfield services and construction.

The Central Energy Italian Gas Holding scandal in 2005 involved Eni and Gazprom. Eni was one of the two companies selected to provide natural gas to Italy. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was a close friend of one of the main owners of Eni. The Italian parliament canceled the contract.

In 2009, the European Commission filed formal antitrust charges against Eni. The commission believes that Eni has conspired (planned) to keep competitors from using its gas pipelines.

Mercedes GP

Mercedes GP Petronas Formula One Team, the trading name of Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix Limited. They are the Formula One racing team and constructor (builder) of Mercedes-Benz. They are racing in the season. Mercedes-Benz debuted in Formula One in , and competed with great success in the and seasons. After the 1955 season, Mercedes left the sport. Despite part-ownerships, and engine supplier deals in the 1990s and 2000s, it did not return as a factory team until November 2009. 

Mercedes has been supplying engines to the McLaren team since . Mercedes-Benz, through its parent Daimler AG, and in partnership with Aabar Investments, reached an agreement to purchase the Brawn GP team. Daimler would buy 45.1% of Brawn, and Aabar would buy 30%. The purchase would be pending corporate and regulatory approval. The Brawn team was created when they purchased the Honda Racing F1 team. Brawn had won the drivers' and constructors' championships in the season, their first and only season as a team.

Former Williams driver Nico Rosberg was joined by seven-time World Champion Michael Schumacher for the team's maiden racing season. Mercedes has Nick Heidfeld as the test and reserve driver. In August, Mercedes released Heidfeld from his contract to allow him to do tyre testing. He will test the new Pirelli tyre that will be used in the season. In September, Heidfeld was signed by Sauber to replace Pedro de la Rosa.

Mercedes-Benz first competed in Grand Prix motor racing in the 1930s. The Silver Arrows cars by Mercedes-Benz and rivals Auto Union were the best racing cars. Both teams were heavily funded by the Nazi regime. They won all the European Grand Prix Championships after 1932. Rudolf Caracciola won three of the championships for Mercedes-Benz.

In 1954 Mercedes-Benz returned to racing in the current f1 series using the advanced Mercedes-Benz W196 (pictured). This car was run in both open-wheeled and streamlined (body work that covered the wheels) forms. Juan Manuel Fangio, a previous champion the season transferred mid-season from Maserati to Mercedes-Benz for their debut at the French Grand Prix on July 4, 1954. The team had immediate success with a 1-2 victory (taking both first and second place) with Fangio and Karl Kling. They also set the fastest lap of the race with (Hans Herrmann). Fangio went on to win three more races in 1954, and won the Formula One World Championship.

They continued to have success in the season, where the same car was used again. Mercedes dominated the season, with Fangio wining four races, and his new team mate Stirling Moss winning the British Grand Prix. Fangio and Moss finished first and second in 1955's World Championship. A terrible crash at the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans on June 11 killed Mercedes driver Pierre Levegh and over 80 spectators. This crash led to the cancellations of the French, German, Spanish and Swiss Grands Prix that year. Mercedes-Benz withdrew from motor sport, including Formula One, at the end of the 1955 season.

The company made a return to the Formula One in by unofficially supplying the Sauber team with engines. The next year, the partnership was made official. For , Mercedes change teams and started supplying engines to the McLaren. Mercedes also purchased a small portion of the McLaren. McLaren won three drivers' championships and one constructors' championship between 1995 and . In 2009, Mercedes began supplying engines to the Brawn GP and Force India teams. In 2009, Brawn won both the driver's and constructors' championship. 

The current Mercedes team can be traced back to the long-running Tyrrell Racing team. Tyrrell competed as a constructor from 1970 until 1998. In 1999, Tyrrell became British American Racing (BAR). BAR formed a partnership with Honda, and becoming Honda Racing F1 Team in 2006. In in December 2008, Honda decided to leave Formula One racing, and Brawn GP, was formed from the Honda Team. Brawn's association with Mercedes began when the team opted to use the Mercedes FO 108W engine at the last minute. Mercedes needed special permission to supply engines to Brawn. The Formula One regulations at the time only allowed an engine supplier to supply two teams. Mercedes was already supplying engines to both McLaren and Force India.

Brawn won the first race it entered at the 2009 Australian Grand Prix. Jenson Button won six of their first seven races of the season, and won the World Championship. His team-mate Rubens Barrichello won at Valencia and Italy. Both Button and Brawn went on to secure the Drivers' and Constructors' World Championships in the race in Brazil, the next to the last race of the season. It was the first time in the sport's sixty-year history that a team won both the drivers' and constructors' titles in its maiden (first) season.

On November 16, 2009, it was officially announced that Mercedes would acquire the Brawn team, with Ross Brawn continuing his duties as team leader. The team will continue to be located in Brackley, United Kingdom. Brackley is less than 30 miles away from Mercedes' Formula One engine plant in Brixworth.

Nico Rosberg was announced as the team's first driver on November 23, 2009. On December 23, 2009, seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher announced that he will be returning to Formula One with the Mercedes team. Brawn's former drivers Jenson Button joined McLaren, and Rubens Barrichello joined Williams team for 2010. With the acquisition of Brawn, Mercedes parted ways with McLaren. The 40% stake that Daimler (which owns Mercedes) has in McLaren will be sold back to the McLaren Group for a reported £500m. 

One reason given for Mercedes parting with McLaren was "because of McLaren's ambitious plans to build road cars". McLaren plan to put the McLaren MP4-12C in production by 2011. Mercedes has said it would continue to supply engines to McLaren until 2015.

In December 2009, the team suffered an early setback when it was discovered that sponsorship deal was invalid. An eighty million pound sponsorship arrangement that had been signed by Brawn with the German company Henkel was invalid. Henkel claimed they were unaware of the deal and were not interested in Formula One. They said the deal was made by a former Henkel employee on stolen company stationery to defrauding the company. On December 22, Henkel announced that the dispute with the Mercedes had been resolved with a mutual agreement and that legal action would not be pursued. Henkel plans to work with the German Prosecutor's Office to clarify the matter.

On December 21, the team announced that Malaysian oil supplier Petronas would join the team as the main sponsor. The team will compete under the full title of Mercedes GP Petronas Formula One Team. According to some reports, the sponsorship is valued at thirty million Euros each year. Together with the fifty million the team received for winning the 2009 championship as Brawn, Mercedes has a budget of eighty million Euros before spending any of their own money.

On January 25, 2010, the team's livery (paint scheme) was publicly unveiled at the Mercedes museum in Stuttgart, with Schumacher and Rosberg in attendance. The car races in Mercedes' traditional silver colors and retains Brawn GP sponsor MIGfx and adds investment group Aabar to its list of sponsors.

Damselfly

Damselflies are insects in the order Odonata. Damselflies are similar to dragonflies, but in a separate suborder, the Zygoptera. There are 20 families of damselfly.

The wings of most damselflies are held along, and parallel to, the body when at rest. There are also damselfly families in which the wings are held open, as in the true dragonflies (Anisoptera). 

Damselflies are also usually smaller, weaker fliers than dragonflies, and their eyes are well separated, by more than their own diameter. Another distinction is that their forewings and hindwings look similar; this is not the case in the true dragonflies.

Like dragonflies, damselflies can only land, but not walk. Their life cycle is also similar. They have incomplete metamorphosis. with an aquatic nymph which is carnivorous.

<doc id="256179" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=256179" title="Rumba">
Rumba

Rumba is a music and dance term with two different meanings.

First, it means Cuban event of African style, the rumba genre of Afro-Cuban music. This use of the term 'rumba' is quite different from the Latin ballroom dance.

Second, it refers to one of the Latin ballroom dances. In this sense, the Rumba is the slowest of the five competitive International Latin dances. The Paso doble, the Samba, the Cha-cha-cha and the Jive are the others. This ballroom Rumba was also danced in Cuba to a rhythm they call the "bolero-son". The international style was derived from studies of dance in Cuba in the pre-revolutionary period.

The "Peanut Vendor" was the first recording of Cuban music to become an international hit. It was described on the label as a "rumba", perhaps because the word "son" would not be understood in English. The label stuck, and a 'rumba craze' developed through the 1930s. This kind of rumba was introduced into dance salons in America and Europe in the 1930s, and was characterized by variable tempo, sometimes nearly twice as fast as the modern ballroom Rumba.

The modern style of dancing the Rumba derives from studies made by dance teacher Monsieur Pierre (Pierre Zurcher-Margolle). Pierre, then from London, visited Cuba in 1947, 1951 and 1953 to find out how and what Cubans were dancing at the time. 

The international ballroom Rumba is a slower dance of about 120 beats per minute which corresponds, both in music and in dance to what the Cubans of an older generation called the "bolero-son". It is easy to see why, for ease of reference and for marketing, "rumba" is a better name, however inaccurate. It is the same kind of reason that led later on to the use of salsa as an overall term for popular music of Cuban origin.

All social dances in Cuba involve a hip-sway over the standing leg and, though this is hardly noticeable in fast salsa, it is more pronounced in the slow ballroom rumba. Walter Laird put it like this:
In general, steps are kept compact and the dance is danced without any rise and fall. This style is authentic, as is the use of free arms in various figures. The basic figures derive from dance moves observed in Havana in the pre-revolutionary period, and have developed their own life since then. Competition figures are often complex, and this is where competition dance separates from social dance. Details can be obtained from the syllabi of dance teaching organizations and from standard texts.

Bullfighting

Bullfighting is an old sport. Today it is mostly done in Spain, and in Portugal, and some countries of South America.

The Spanish bullfight ("Corrida de toros") is a fight to the death. The modern bullfight has a ritual. It has three distinct stages, the start of each being signalled by a trumpet. The bullfighters ("Toreros") enter the arena in a parade, to Paso doble music. 

A team of bullfighters is seven men. The leader is the matador, and he has six assistants, who play roles in the drama. Bullfighters' costumes are inspired by 18th century Andalusian clothing. "Matadores" ('those who kill the bull') are easily seen by the gold of their "traje de luces" ('suit of lights').

At the end comes the "tercio de muerte" ('the third of death'). The matador re-enters the ring alone with a small red cape, and a sword. The cape called a "muleta". The matador uses his cape to attract the bull in a series of passes. The "faena" is the performance with the cape. The "faena" ends with a final series of passes in which the bullfighter tries to move the bull into position. He then stabs it between the shoulder blades and through the aorta or heart. The act of thrusting in the sword is called an "estocada".

If the matador gets it wrong, he may be gored by the bull's horns, and killed. This does happen: some very famous matadors have died in the ring. When the great matador Manolete was killed in the ring at the age of 31, three days of official national mourning were held. Bullrings do have an infirmary with an operating room, for the immediate treatment of bullfighters with horn wounds.

There is great opposition to the bullfight from animal welfare organisations. There are also versions of the bullfight in which the animal is unharmed.

Casual sex

Casual sex means some types of sexual activity outside of a romantic relationship. The term is not always used the same way: some use it to refer to any extramarital sex outside of marriage, some use it to refer to sex in a casual relationship, and others use the word for one-time encounters, promiscuity, or to refer to sex in the absence of emotional attachment or love.

A hookup is casual sex activity that could consist of masturbation, oral sex, or sexual intercourse. An extended hookup sometimes refers to many casual sex interactions with the same person. This is a situation in which the involved people meet for casual sex multiple times, always without a long-term commitment. This is a casual relationship is usually only for sex and without any emotional meaning. Also another similar term is "no strings attached" ("NSA") sex. 

Other terms used to describe two people engaged in a relationship in which there is no emotional but only sexual involvement are "fuck buddies", "friends with benefits", "booty call", and "ami calin" (the popular French term).

One-night stand is a single sexual encounter between people, where at least one person has no desire to start a longer-term sexual or romantic relationship.

Anonymous sex is a form of one-night stand or "casual sex" between people who have very little or no history with each other, often engaging in sexual activity on the same day of their meeting and usually never seeing each other again after the sex.

There are many specialist online dating services or other internet websites, known as "adult personals" or "adult matching" sites, which cater to people looking for a purely physical relationship, without emotional attachments. These can provide a relatively anonymous forum where people who are geographically close but in totally separate work and social circles can make contact.

Ice algae

Ice algae and snow algae are algae and cyanobacteria which grow on snow and ice fields. They may color the snow and ice green or red during the summer months. The red color is a protection against the ultraviolet radiation of the sun, which causes mutations. Without it, the algae would suffer chromosome breaks and DNA mutations.

There are ice algal communities on sea ice. The algae are important in Polar ecosystems (especially Antarctica) because they provide food for krill. Krill scrape off the algae from the underside of the ice, which is colored green by the algae. The algae may be found between ice crystals or attached to them, in the water or saltwater channels between ice crystals. 

"Chlamydomonas nivalis" is a green alga which causes Watermelon snow.

Watermelon snow is snow that is reddish or pink in color, and that has a smell similar to a fresh watermelon. This type of snow is common during the summer in alpine and coastal polar regions, such as the Sierra Nevada of California. Here, at altitudes of 10,000 to 12,000 feet (3,000–3,600 m), the temperature is cold throughout the year, and so the snow lingers from winter storms. When someone steps on the snow, the footprints look red. 
"Chlamydomonas nivalis" is a green alga which owes its red color to a bright red carotenoid pigment. This protects the chloroplast and cell nucleus from strong visible and ultraviolet radiation. The green and red pigments absorb light and heat, which gives the alga liquid water as the snow melts around it. Algal blooms may go 25 cm (10 inches) deep. Since each cell measures 20 to 30 micrometers in diameter, a teaspoon of melted snow contains a million or more cells. The algae build up in 'sun cups', which are shallow depressions in the snow. The carotenoid pigment absorbs heat, which deepens the sun cups, and makes the glaciers and snowbanks melt faster.

During the winter months, when snow covers them, the algae become dormant. In spring, nutrients, increased levels of light and meltwater, stimulate germination. Once they germinate, the resting cells release smaller green flagellate cells which travel towards the surface of the snow. Once the flagellated cells reach the surface, they may lose their flagellae and form thick-walled resting cells, or they may function as gametes, fusing in pairs to form zygotes.

Many species feed on "C. nivalis", including protozoans such as ciliates, rotifers, nematodes, ice worms and springtails.

The first accounts of watermelon snow are in the writings of Aristotle. Watermelon snow has puzzled mountain climbers, explorers, and naturalists for thousands of years.

In May 1818, four ships sailed from England to search for the Northwest Passage and chart the Arctic coastline of North America. Bad weather made them finally turn the ships back, but the expedition made important contributions to science. Captain John Ross noticed crimson snow that streaked the white cliffs like streams of blood as they were rounding Cape York on the northwest coast of Greenland. A landing party stopped and brought back samples to England. "The Times" wrote about this discovery on December 4, 1818:

When Ross published his story of the voyage in 1818, the story had an appendix of plants by Robert Brown. In it, Brown compared the red snow to an alga.

<doc id="256260" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=256260" title="Scuderia Toro Rosso">
Scuderia Toro Rosso

Scuderia Toro Rosso (Italian for "Team Red Bull") or just Toro Rosso is one of two Formula One teams owned by Austrian beverage company Red Bull. The other team is Red Bull Racing. Toro Rosso ran its first race in the season. 

Toro Rosso is the sister team of Red Bull Racing. The goal is to use Toro Rosso to develop the skills of promising drivers for the Red Bull Racing. Vitantonio Liuzzi scored Roro Rosso's first point in its first season at the United States Grand Prix. The team's first pole position and victory were scored by Sebastian Vettel at the Italian Grand Prix.

For the , , and seasons, Toro Rosso used Ferrari engines. Toro Rosso started using the Ferrari engines when Red Bull Racing switched from Ferrari to Renault engines. Its car, the Toro Rosso STR4 was nearly identical to the Red Bull RB5. Both cars were designed by Adrian Newey.

Minardi had competed in Formula One from 1985 to 2005. Minardi had a large fan base, but they were one of the least competitive teams in the sport. The main reason for their lack of performance was a relatively small budget. Minardi owner Paul Stoddart said he had 41 offers to buy the team. Stoddart preferred to sell the team to someone who could "take it further" than he could. He also wanted an owner who would maintain the team in its traditional base in Italy. The terms of the deal with Red Bull included a requirement that the team must keep in Faenza, Italy until at least the season.

Red Bull decided to changed the Minardi name because of their sponsorship and marketing plans. Red Bull used the Italian language in the new name to hint at the team's Italian heritage. Red Bull changed the name of the team after taking control of the team to 'Scuderia Toro Rosso'.

Vitantonio Liuzzi and Scott Speed were the race drivers, with Neel Jani filling the test/third driver role. Liuzzi had raced part time for Red Bull Racing in , while Speed entered F1 following the Red Bull Driver Search in the United States. Jani was the test driver for Sauber Petronas in .

The 2006 Toro Rosso chassis was a modified version of the 2005 Red Bull Racing RB1. Some teams felt that this infringed the rule that each team must design their own car. Toro Rosso claim that this design was first produced during by Jaguar Racing, Red Bull's predecessor. They believed that the design rights had belonged to the Ford Motor Company, Jaguar Racing's parent company before passing to Toro Rosso.

The new Formula One regulations for 2006 required new V8 engines. Toro Rosso was allowed to used Minardi's supply of power limited Cosworth 3 liter V10 engines. This option had been created to assist the less funded teams the expense of building new engines. Formula One allowing Toro Rosso to use this option after the Red Bull takeover caused friction with other teams, in particular Super Aguri and Midland. These teams felt that the engine gave Toro Rosso too much of an advantage. They relived that the concession to allow the team use the V10 engine was based on Minardi's poor financial situation, and should not have apply after the team was purchased by Red Bull.

 For the season, Toro Rosso began using the Ferrari 056 V8 engine, taking over the contract that Red Bull Racing broke from by switching to Renault engines.

At the launch of the STR2 on 13 February, Gerhard Berger confirmed Liuzzi as a driver. In testing in Bahrain on 24 February, Scott Speed was confirmed as the team's second driver. Three-time Champ Car champion Sébastien Bourdais was the unofficial test driver several times during the season.

The 2007 season was generally disappointing. The team suffered poor reliability and driver errors that lead to a low number of race finishes. Following the European Grand Prix, Scott Speed was removed as a driver. He was replaced by BMW Sauber development driver Sebastian Vettel. Vettel was later confirmed as a driver for .

At the Chinese Grand Prix, Toro Rosso scored their best results. Vettel finishing fourth and Liuzzi sixth, scoring eight points for the team. These were also the drivers' best finishes in Formula One. It was a big improvement over the preceding race. At the Japanese Grand Prix, Vettel crashed into Mark Webber's Red Bull under safety car conditions (full course yellow). Webber was running in second place, and Vettel was in third place. Liuzzi lost the possibility of scoring a point after a 25-second penalty. He was penalized for passing Adrian Sutil's Spyker for eighth place under a local yellow flag condition. The penalty dropped him to ninth place.

Scuderia Toro Rosso's drivers for were Sebastian Vettel and Sébastien Bourdais. Bourdais earned his first points in F1 with a 7th place finish at the Australian Grand Prix. Vettel scored his first points of the season with a 5th place finish at the Monaco Grand Prix. 

The team pulled off a massive shock at the wet Italian Grand Prix. Vettel claiming a pole position and won the race. It was the first pole and win for both himself and Toro Rosso. This was also the first win for a Ferrari engine in a customer chassis. Vettel's performances earned him a place at Red Bull Racing for .

 With Vettel moving to Red Bull Racing Sébastien Buemi and Sébastien Bourdais were the Toro Rosso drivers for . Before the season started, the team's boss Franz Tost said that it would be "difficult" to do as well as they did in the 2008 season. On 16 July, Toro Rosso announced that Bourdais' contract was terminated. On 20 July, the team announced that Jaime Alguersuari will replace Bourdais starting with the Hungarian Grand Prix. 

The season ended with Toro Rosso finishing in last place in the championship. Force India was able to move ahead in the point race after finishing second in the Belgian Grand Prix. At the end of the season, Sébastien Buemi was able to score points in the final two races. Jaime Alguersuari failed to score any points in the season.

Controversy was present as whether or not the team threw away their chances by having two inexperienced drivers as essentially their car had the same DNA as what is said to have been the best on the grid, Redbull Racing's RB5.
Scuderia Toro Rosso confirmed that they would keep Sébastien Buemi and Jaime Alguersuari for . Under the new regulations they also had to build and design there own car without help from Red Bull Technology, the teams first since Minardi. Alguersuari scored the first points of his career finishing ninth at the Malaysian Grand Prix. They went on to perform poorly throughout the season occasionally mixing it with the saubers, Force Indias and Vitaly Petrov. However they were continually the 'driver' who went out of the first qualifying with the three new teams.

The 2008 contract between the FIA and the Formula One teams outlawing customer cars starting in . Because of this, Red Bull put the Toro Rosso team up for sale in March 2008. They had hoped to sell the team by the end of the season. Until the team is sold, Toro Rosso will continue in its present form.On the 3rd of January 2011 rumours spread that a buyer had been found..

Sports sponsorship is a major part of Red Bull's marketing strategy. Scuderia Toro Rosso is not the first sports team to be bought and completely renamed. The same was done for Red Bull Racing (formerly Jaguar Racing), the Austrian football club Red Bull Salzburg (formerly "SV Austria Salzburg"), Austrian Ice Hockey team Red Bull Salzburg EC and MLS' Red Bull New York (previously "Metrostars").

Other current sponsors and suppliers include Hangar-7, Volkswagen, Advanti Racing (wheel), USAG, Magneti Marelli, Advanti Racing, Siemens and Hexagon Metrology.

Quena

The quena, also written as "kena" in English, is the traditional flute of Peru and the Andes. Made of bamboo, it has six finger holes and one thumb hole and is open on both ends. To make a sound, the player closes the top end of the pipe with the flesh between his chin and lower lip, and blows a stream of air downward, over a notch cut into the end. It is normally in the key of G major. G is the lowest note when all the holes are covered. It produces a very breathy or airy tone.

The quenacho (also "kenacho" in English) is a bigger, lower sounding type of quena and made the same way. It is in the key of D major, a fourth lower than the quena. In most of Andes' towns "vamos a ir a la quena" (we will go to the quena) was used to threaten little children, because the quena was made of bamboo, a hard material.

Quena is mostly used in traditional Andean music. In the 1960s and 1970s the quena was used by several Nueva Canción musicians. Some groups such as Illapu have used it regularly. In the 1980s and 1990s some post-Nueva Canción rock groups have also used the quena in some of their songs; notably Soda Stereo in "Cuando Pase el Temblor" and Los Enanitos Verdes in "Lamento Boliviano". The quena is also relatively common in World music.

<doc id="256334" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=256334" title="Gondwana">
Gondwana

Gondwana, formerly Gondwanaland, is the name given to a southern supercontinent which was formed when Pangaea broke up, starting 180 million years ago (mya), in the early middle Jurassic. 

The Pangaean global supercontinent completed its formation 250 million years ago (mya). After the split, Gondwana separated from Laurasia, which was the northern part of Pangaea. There were then these two large segments, nearly equal in area. 

While the northern hemisphere continent Laurasia moved further north, Gondwana drifted south. It included most of the landmasses in today's southern hemisphere, including Antarctica, South America, Africa, Madagascar, Australia–New Guinea, and New Zealand, as well as Arabia and the Indian subcontinent, which have now moved entirely into the Northern Hemisphere. 

Gondwana itself began to break up in the mid-Jurassic, about 170 mya. It split into the present-day continents listed above.

The continent of Gondwana was named by Austrian scientist, Eduard Suess, after the Gondwana region of central northern India (from Sanskrit gondavana 'forest of the Gonds'), from which the Gondwana sedimentary sequences (Permian–Triassic) are also found.

The adjective Gondwanan is in common use in biogeography when referring to patterns of distribution of living organisms, typically when the organisms are restricted to two or more of the now-discontinuous regions that were once part of Gondwana, including the Antarctic flora. For example, the Proteaceae, a family of plants that is known only from southern South America, South Africa, and Australia are considered to have a "Gondwanan distribution". This pattern shows an ancient lineage.

It was evidence of plant and animal distribution which lent weight to the ideas of Alfred Russel Wallace and Alfred Wegener. Wallace explained geographical distribution as the result of evolution, and Wegener used it as evidence for continental drift.

Africa separated from Antarctica around 160 mya, followed by the Indian subcontinent, in the early Cretaceous (about 125 mya). About 65 mya, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a tropical to subtropical climate, complete with a marsupial fauna. About 40 mya Australia-New Guinea separated from Antarctica, so that latitudinal currents could isolate Antarctica from Australia, and the first ice began to appear. During the Eocene-Oligocene extinction event about 34 million years ago, CO levels have been found to be about 760 ppm and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm. Around 23 mya, the Drake Passage opened between Antarctica and South America, resulting in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current that completely isolated the continent. Models of the changes suggest that declining CO levels became more important. The ice began to spread, replacing the forests that then covered the continent. Since about 15 mya, the continent has been mostly covered with ice, with the Antarctic ice cap reaching its present extension around 6 mya.

There are several submarine lands in the Indian Ocean off the west of Australia. They are under more than 1.5 kilometres of water. Evidence that they are former parts of Gondwana is given by their rocks, which are not typical oceanic rocks like basalt. They are typical land rocks such as granite, sandstone, and gneiss, and they have fossils of a kind now found on continental areas. Recently two of these sunken islands were found to the west of Perth. These islands are almost the size of Tasmania, and have flat tops. This shows they were once at sea level before being submerged. The conclusion is that when India began to break away from Australasia in the early Cretaceous, the islands formed part of the last link between the two present-day continents.

Already known is Naturaliste Plateau, a submerged land off Western Australia. It has an area of 90,000 square kilometres. Interest has been shown in its potential oil deposits. When above land in the Mesozoic, it had a tropical climate which might have been ideal for producing coal, oil and natural gas.

The Kerguelen Plateau is a submerged microcontinent in the southern Indian Ocean. It is about 3,000 km to the southwest of Australia and extends for more than 2,200 km in a northwest-southeast direction. It is in deep water, but there is a small part of the plateau that breaks sea level, forming the French Kerguelen Islands, and the Australian Heard Island and McDonald Islands. 

The islands are part of a large igneous province (LIP) which started when Gondwana started to break up, 130 million years ago in the Lower Cretaceous.

Volcanic activity occurs sometimes on Heard and McDonald islands.

Macrophage

Macrophages are white blood cells within tissues, produced by the differentiation of monocytes. 

Monocytes and macrophages are phagocytes, acting in general immunity. They also trigger specific defense mechanisms (adaptive immunity) of vertebrates. 

Their role is to phagocytose (engulf and then digest) cellular debris and pathogens either as stationary or as mobile cells. They also stimulate lymphocytes and other immune cells to respond to the pathogen.

When a monocyte enters damaged tissue through the wall of a blood vessel it changes to become a macrophage. Monocytes are attracted to a damaged site by chemical substances, triggered by a range of stimuli. At some sites such as the testis, macrophages have been shown to populate the organ through proliferation. 

Unlike short-lived neutrophils, macrophages survive longer in the body, up to several months.

Granulocyte

Granulocytes are a category of white blood cells characterized by the presence of granules in their cytoplasm. They are also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes because of the shape of the nucleus, which has three segments. The term "polymorphonuclear leukocyte" often refers just to neutrophils, the most abundant of the granulocytes. 

Granulocytes are released from the bone marrow. They operate by phagocytosis and other means. 

There are three types of granulocytes, distinguished by their appearance under Wright's stain:

Their names are derived from their staining characteristics; for example, the most abundant granulocyte is the neutrophil granulocyte, which has neutrally-staining cytoplasmic granules.

Other white blood cells which are not granulocytes are mainly lymphocytes and monocytes.

Vesoul

Vesoul is a city in the Haute-Saône departement in France. It is also the capital of that departement. About 19.000 people lived in Vesoul in 2010. 

Vesoul is first mentioned in a document dated 899. That document speaks about an elevation with a fortified watchtower. The document speaks about "Castrum Vesulium". Castrum is a fortification, and "Vesulium" has the syllable "ves" which meant hill or mountain in a language that was spoken before the Celts. Today, there is a castle that forms the centre of the city. The first houses were built inside the walls of the castle. Newcomers who found no place settled outside the city walls, on the flanks of the hill. Growing wine was popular. 
In 1814, after the fall of the empire, a buffer state was created, with Vesoul as capital. The principality was that of Free County, of the Vosges and of Porrentruy.

Today, one of the main factories of PSA Peugeot Citroën is near Vesoul.

The Haute-Saône is a rural department. It is unusual because the urban population is based around five towns: Vesoul, Gray, Héricourt, Lure and Luxeuil-les-Bains. Vesoul, the prefecture is not very important in terms of population. The Durgeon and Colombine rivers flow through the commune.


The first public library of Vesoul opened in 1771. The "abbé" (abbot) Bardenet, superior of the Saint-Esprit hospital in Besançon, gave his book collection to the town. There were 1772 books. The collections became a lot larger with the Revolution. At that time, the revolutionaries (people who led the French Revolution) took the books from the monasteries of the town ("capucins") and even of the region ("Luxeuil" and "Faverney" monasteries). Around 20,000 books were added to the library this way, including some 11th century manuscripts. The Mayor's office was responsible for keeping the books.

In 1981, the municipality decided to build a new building to encourage the public to read. The library was recently equipped with computers. There are around 200 manuscripts and 150 incunables.

Vesoul is only twinned with one town:

Hungaroring

The Hungaroring is a Formula One racing circuit in Mogyoród, near Budapest, Hungary where the Hungarian Grand Prix is held. In 1986, it became the location of the first Formula One Grand Prix behind the Iron Curtain. Formula One leader Bernie Ecclestone wanted a race in the USSR, but was not able to make a deal with Moscow. A Hungarian friend of his recommended the city of Budapest. Formula One wanted a street circuit similar to the Circuit de Monaco to be built in the Népliget, Budapest's largest park. The Hungarian government decided to build a new circuit (track) just outside the city near a major highway. Construction work started on October 1, 1985. the circuit was built in eight months, less time than any other Formula One circuit. The first race was held on March 24, 1986 in memory of János Drapál. Drapál was the first Hungarian to win a Grand Prix motorcycle race. A survey by the Hungarian national tourism office ranks Mogyoród third in venues visited by tourists in Hungary..

The Hungaroring is a circuit in the Formula One Grands Prix calendar. The F1 race is normally held in the middle of a Central European summer. The circuit is generally dusty, which limits traction. This is because the track is not used very much throughout the season and it is built on sandy soil. The track is built in a natural valley. About 80 percent of the racetrack is visible from any viewing location.

The Hungaroring is a twisty style circuit, where passing difficult.

The Hungaroring is the home of Hungarian motorsport. Besides Formula One, there were also DTM, FIA GT Championship races in its history. A public drag race event takes place every month.

Most of the foreign fans are from Germany and Austria. The Hungaroring has traditionally seen a large number of Finnish fans as well. With the loss of the Austrian Grand Prix, this is the closest Formula One event for fans from other Central European countries. The race saw many spectators from Poland due to the debut of the first Polish Formula One driver, Robert Kubica. 

The Hungarian Grand Prix has always been more of a promotional event than a profit raising event.. The Formula One contract was extended until 2016. Tobacco advertising has been banned since 2007.

Building model

A building model is either a physical (real) or virtual (computer) model of a building. Very often, the physical model is smaller than the original (scale model). 

There are three basic types of building models: architectural, structural and mathematical (virtual).

An architectural model is a type of a physical model of a structure to study an architectural design or to share design ideas to clients, committees, and the general public. Architectural models are a tool which may be used for show, presentation, fundraising, getting permits, and sale purposes. Such models are a good tool for three-dimensional understanding of a design, used by architects, interior designers and exhibit designers. 

Engineers who need scale models to test the likely performance of a design at an early stage of development without paying for a full-sized prototype.

Virtual model is a digital model of the object (typically greatly simplified) that can be used in a computer simulation or virtual reality.

The most common examples of virtual models are those created in 3D for the purpose of "visualisation" - seeing how the structure looks before it is built. The field of architecture has greatly popularized the use of virtual models to animate fly-throughs of yet-to-be-built buildings.

Virgin Racing

Virgin Racing is a Formula One racing team, which made its debut in the 2010 Formula One season. They were allowed to join F1 as Manor Grand Prix on 12 June 2009. They were one of four new teams selected to race in the 2010 season. On 30 November, the FIA released a revised entry list that stated the team's name as Virgin Racing. Richard Branson's Virgin Group is the title sponsor of the team, which was launched on 15 December 2009.

On 11 November, Russian car builder Marussia Motors became the majority share owner in Virgin Racing. Marussia has been a partner to Virgin Racing since the team started in 2009. The team will be known as Marussia Virgin Racing.

The team was first formed as Manor Grand Prix as a partership between Manor Motorsport and Wirth Research. 

Initially, Virgin's Alex Tai was the Team Principal (person in charge). Less than one month after the Virgin partnership was officially launched, Tai left his position and John Booth took over as team principal 

The team will use engines supplied by Cosworth. Manor Motorsport are best known as a Formula Three team. They currently competes in the Formula Three Euroseries, and helped launch the careers of World Champions Kimi Räikkönen and Lewis Hamilton. Race car preparation and racing operations will be run from its headquarters in Dinnington, South Yorkshire. Wirth Research will design, develop and build the cars from its base in Bicester.

The Virgin Racing also have plans to create a "Driver Academy", a series of racing teams starting in the new GP3 Series and advancing all the way up to Formula One.

Virgin's car for 2010, the VR-01, is the first F1 car designed entirely using Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) computer simulation technology. CFD is computer program used to design a race car that will move through the air well. It is used to replace test models of cars in a wind tunnel to see how well they perform. 

On 17 November 2009 Virgin announced that former Toyota driver Timo Glock would be the team's lead driver for the 2010 season. The driver has signed a two year contract with a one year extension offer. Long-time Brazilian GP2 regular Lucas di Grassi will join him. Fellow former GP2 driver Luiz Razia will be the testing and reserve driver. Álvaro Parente also signed as a test driver, but left the team prior to the launch of the VR-01. The 2010 car was officially launched on the team's website on 3 February 2010. The following two days, Virgin ran the car at a private event at Silverstone.

After the start of the 2010 season, it was discovered that the race car's fuel tank is too small. Starting in 2010, cars cannot be refueled during the race. The Virgin cars would not be able to finish any races unless the drivers ran at a reduced speed to conserve fuel. The team has been allowed to redesign the chassis to increase the fuel tank size. 

The team was not able to complete a full race with both cars until the Spanish Grand Prix, the fifth race of the season.

During the warm-up just before the race, Timo Glock had a problem with his race car. Fifth gear in the transmission broke. Glock returned to the garage area. The team mechanics tried to fix the car. The team was not able to fix the transmission before the race started. Glock did not start the race, and was listed as DNS for Did Not Start.

Virgin purchased eighty percent of the team, as part of sponsorship arrangement. The official FIA entry list for 2010 announced on 30 November 2009 showed that Manor GP had been entered as Virgin Racing. 

The team's partners for 2010 include 

On 14 December 2009, Lloyds Banking Group announced that it had invested ten million pounds in the team. This is a reverse the recent trend of financial institutions such as ING and RBS to withdraw sponsorship. It remains unclear as to whether or not the Lloyds logo will appear on the cars.

The Love Parade was a popular and free access electronic dance music festival and parade that originated in 1989 in Berlin, Germany. The parade features stages, but is well known for its floats with music, DJs and dancers moving through the audience. This was the first edition of the festival that was organised in a closed-off festival area. Up to people were reported to be attending the event and 1,200 police were on hand.

The event was one of the program elements of RUHR.2010, whereby cultural events in the Ruhr area are highlighted, because the Ruhr is this year's European Capital of Culture.

The festival organizer said that there would be no more Love Parades after this. He said, "Out of respect for the victims, their families and friends, we are going to discontinue the event in the future, and that means the end of the Love Parade."

Monocyte

Monocytes are a type of white blood cell, part of the human body's immune system. They are usually identified in stained smears by their large two-lobed nucleus. They are a kind of reserve cell which turn into macrophages and immune helper cells called dendritic cells.

Monocytes work at two speeds in the immune system: 

Half of all monocytes are stored as a reserve in the spleen; the rest are circulating or in tissues. 

Monocytes are produced by the bone marrow from stem cell precursors called "monoblasts". Monocytes circulate in the bloodstream for about one to three days and then typically move into tissues throughout the body. They make up three to eight percent of the leukocytes in the blood. 

Monocytes which migrate from the bloodstream to the tissues will then differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells, which then stay in the tissue. Macrophages are responsible for protecting tissues from foreign substances. They are cells that possess a large smooth nucleus, a large area of cytoplasm and many internal vesicles for processing foreign material.

Monocytes and their macrophage and dendritic cell progeny serve three main functions in the immune system. These are phagocytosis, antigen presentation and cytokine production.

Classical antiquity

Classical antiquity (also the classical era or classical period) is a broad term for a long period of cultural history around the Mediterranean. It includes the civilizations of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, known as the Greco-Roman world. 

Classical antiquity is the period in which Greek and Roman literature (such as Aeschylus, Ovid, Homer and others) flourished.

The earliest period of classical antiquity took place before the re-appearance of historical sources after the Bronze Age collapse. The earliest Greek alphabetic inscriptions are in the first half of the 8th century. Homer is usually assumed to have lived in the 8th or 7th century, and his lifetime is often taken as marking the beginning of classical antiquity. In the same period falls the traditional date for the establishment of the Ancient Olympic Games, in 776 BC.

The Phoenicians originally expanded from Levantine ports, by the 8th century dominating trade in the Mediterranean. Carthage was founded in 814 BC, and the Carthaginians by 700 BC had firmly established strongholds in Sicily, Italy and Sardinia, which brought about conflicts of interest with Etruria.

The Archaic period followed the Greek Dark Ages, and saw the rise of democracy, philosophy, theatre, poetry, as well as the revitalisation of the written language (which had been lost during the Dark Ages).

Pottery styles of the later part of the Archaic age are the black-figure pottery, started in Corinth during the 7th century BC. Its successor was the red-figure style, developed by the Andokides in about 530 BC.

The classical period of Ancient Greece was from the fall of the Athenian tyranny in 510 BC to the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC). During this period cane the long struggle between Sparta and Athens, and the wars between the Greeks and the Persians. The rise of Macedon in the 4th century overturned all other political systems, at least for a while.

The Hellenistic period began with Alexander, when Greek became the "lingua franca" far beyond Greece itself, and Hellenistic culture came in contact with the cultures of Persia, Central Asia, India and Egypt. 
The Hellenistic period ended with the rise of the Roman Republic to a super-regional power in the 2nd century BC and the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC.

The Roman Forum was the central area around which ancient Rome developed.
The republican period of Ancient Rome began with the overthrow of the Monarchy at about 509 BC and lasted over 450 years until its subversion, through a series of civil wars and the Imperial period. 

Determining the precise end of the Republic is a matter of dispute. Roman citizens of the time did not recognize that the Republic had ceased to exist. 

It could be said that Rome was already of imperial character since it conquered Gaul, Illyria, Greece and Hispania, and the Roman provice Asia.

During Late Antiquity Christianity rose under Constantine I, and finally became the Roman imperial cult in 393. Successive invasions of Germanic tribes meant the
thr end of the Western Empire in the 5th century, but the Eastern Empire persisted throughout the Middle Ages as the Byzantine Empire.

Respect for the ancients of Greece and Rome affected politics, philosophy, sculpture, literature, theater, education, architecture and even sexuality.

In politics, the presence of a Roman Emperor was felt to be desirable long after the empire fell. This tendency reached its peak when Charlemagne was crowned "Roman Emperor" in the year 800, an act which led to the formation of the Holy Roman Empire. The notion that an emperor is a monarch who outranks a mere king dates from this period. In this political ideal, there would always be a Roman Empire, a state whose jurisdiction extended to the entire civilized western world.

Hello all,

in recent days we have seen many discussions at Simple talk. Because it is a "high-volume" page, Enwp has several pages for the equivalent of Simple talk. Given the volume, I propose we do the same, we should create a separate page for "Discussions that may change the way this wikipedia works", and no longer have these on simple talk. What do you think? -- () 12:58, 25 July 2010 (UTC)

Hey guys. This is something that has been bugging me for a long time. The word disambiguation is NOT simple, yet it is used on many pages here on Simple Wiki. I would like to propose changing disambiguation to a simpler word. Unfortunately, I don't know any words that would be of use to change this to. Does anybody have ideas? Thanks.-- |  20:21, 22 July 2010 (UTC)

Hello,

I just added a "movie" to the requests for deletion. Given Hollywood, and Bollywood, and a few other countries have movie industries that "mass-produce" movies, songs, and the like, I do have a very basic question:

Opinions welcome (and no, this is not a new way of producing drama, or of letting people bang their heads together). This is about finding out what media content is notable, and what is not. -- () 21:21, 23 July 2010 (UTC)

If you want "clear" notability guideline, here are three ways to tell if a film is definitely notable. Anything else is open to debate:


Basically a simplified version of the film notability guidelines DJ cites above (though that also notes anything that passes general would most likely pass the film notability as well). Most of the films you've bantered about meet at least two of these. This topic has gained newfound interest due to the nomination of Epic Movie as an AFD; it meets none of them 04:11, 25 July 2010 (UTC)

What? Reliable sources arbitrary? Just because you haven't heard of something doesn't mean it's not notable, nor does not liking numbers mean that a criterion should be discounted. And the Acamedy Awards and National Film Registry are "clearly" both notable, here, there or anywhere (the National Film Registry contains a lot of "old films", including many that were historically significant though not box office smashes) 18:37, 26 July 2010 (UTC)

Anybody can make those notices, right? (so that bureaucrats and mops know that when closing a discussion; often blocked, new or IP users' votes are disqualifed). And that doesn't violate any policy, right? 'Cuz when I noted that the nominator had been blocked, somebody threw a couple English essays at me (NOSPADE and ADHOM). Those don't really apply in this case, right? 15:08, 25 July 2010 (UTC)

I am an IP editor, but not a blocked one. I thought that IPs could contribute to discussions by making comments, but they were not allowed to vote in requests for permissions, deletion and similar things. () 03:34, 31 July 2010 (UTC)

Do I have to make the request for registration on enwp? 09:05, 30 July 2010 (UTC)

This continues "ad nauseum". No administrator has unblocked, and it seems unlikely that a consensus for unblocking will occur. @:~$ 17:54, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

The outcome of this discussion will not change. Let's please move on. Hoots will stay blocked. () 20:51, 31 July 2010 (UTC)

User Hoots (plus a few of his other accounts) have been blocked "indefinitely", and as is apparent above, there is currently no consensus as to unblocking him. This post is merelely about the "indefinitely". In my opinion, Indefinite blocks are useless. We do not know who will be around in two years time, the people who currently support or oppose the block might not, the admins who enacted the block might not. For this reason, the block should imo be changed to either a six-month, or a one-year block, to be reviewed when it runs out. Open for comments. (When commenting, please keep in mind that we already spent time to find out that we cannot agree on an unblock, at this time. This will likely not have changed in the last week) -- () 11:38, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

After the session was over Jeff Hanneman talked with him and the two began playing Iron Maiden and Judas Priest songs with the session drummer. Hanneman said "Why don’t we start our OWN band?” [Laughs] I was like, “…Fuck yeah!"
King once had long hair, but then shaved his head when he started balding. His bald head, spiked wristband, long beard and his tattoo work (which covers his hands, arms and head) are his trademarks, to such a degree that "Blender" included a tour of his body ink.

Surfing with the Alien

Surfing with the Alien is the second album by instrumental rock solo artist Joe Satriani, released in 1987. "Surfing with the Alien" contributed greatly to establishing Satriani's reputation as a respected rock guitarist.

The album contains fast and complex songs such as "Surfing with the Alien" and "Satch Boogie", stranger-sounding "Crushing Day" and "Lords of Karma", and slower, melodic songs like "Always with Me, Always with You" and "Echo" which provide a change of pace. Also, "Midnight", uses the technique of two-hand tapping at great speed, making a Latin-American effect. There are also Nashville tuned guitars (on "Echo") and key changes (on "Always with Me, Always with You" and "Echo") to vary the album.

The album cover shows the Marvel Comics character, the Silver Surfer on the front and the hand of Galactus on the back. The image is from Silver Surfer #1 (1982). The artist, John Byrne, has said that the image was used without his permission and that he never got paid for its use. The art is from panel 1 of page 6 of SILVER SURFER #1 published in 1982. However, the album liner notes mention a Marvel Characters, Inc. copyright and say the Silver Surfer likeness is used with permission.

All songs written by Joe Satriani.

<doc id="256773" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=256773" title="Lee Harvey Oswald">
Lee Harvey Oswald

Lee Harvey Oswald (October 18, 1939 – November 24, 1963) was, according to four government investigations, the sniper who assassinated U.S. President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963.

A former U.S. Marine who had defected to live in the Soviet Union for almost 3 years, Oswald was initially arrested in the death of police officer J. D. Tippit, who had been shot on a Dallas street shortly after Kennedy was killed. Soon suspected in the death of Kennedy as well, Oswald denied both killings. Two days later, while being transferred from police headquarters to the county jail, Oswald was mortally wounded by nightclub owner Jack Ruby, in full view of television cameras broadcasting live.

In 1964, the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy, a conclusion reached previously by the FBI and Dallas Police. In 1979, The United States House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations agreed that Kennedy was killed by Oswald, but also concluded it was probably as a result of a conspiracy. The members of this probable conspiracy were not identified.

Oswald had been born in New Orleans, 2 months after his father died, and his mother moved him and 2 brothers to several different towns, while marrying a third husband for 3 years, 1945-48. After attending 12 schools, around Fort Worth, New York City, and New Orleans, Oswald dropped out of 10th grade, at age 16, and worked as a office clerk/messenger. Moving back to Texas in July 1956, Oswald entered 10th grade in Fort Worth, but quit school again, at age 17 in October, to join the U.S. Marines, as had his brother Robert, after their half-brother John Pic joined the U.S. Coast Guard. In 1959, Oswald received a hardship discharge (for mother's health) to quit the Marines, but defected to the Soviet Union, for nearly 3 years. Having married Marina, the daughter of a Soviet security official, he re-defected back to the U.S. with her and their daughter, in June 1962.

They settled in Dallas, with his mother and brother Robert. Oswald worked 3 months in a welding company, then worked in a printing shop from October until being fired in April 1963. Oswald was later suspected of the April 10 attempt to shoot General Edwin Walker, using a rifle (and handgun) he received through mail-order in March. Oswald and Marina quickly moved to New Orleans in April, but she returned to Dallas in late September 1963, when he traveled to Mexico with failed plans to go to Cuba and the USSR. Instead, he returned to Dallas and began working at the Texas School Book Depository on October 16, 1963. The FBI was investigating Marina as a possible Soviet spy. That was one month before the shootings of President Kennedy and Officer Tippit.

Oswald died on November 24, 1963, in police custody, after being shot by Jack Ruby. He was survived by his wife Marina, 2-year-old daughter June, and 1-month-old daughter Rachel.

Race track

A race track is special place built for racing. The racing may be for people, animals, or vehicles. Examples of animal racing are horse racing. Examples of vehicle racing are automobiles and motorcycles. A race track may have seats for the spectators to watch the race.

Other name for race tracks are race course, speedway, and circuit.
Modern racetracks are designed with safety as the first priority. This is very important for race tracks used in auto racing. Safety foe the spectator, track workers, and racers. Fences are often used to protect the spectators from the race track. Barriers, sometimes padded, are used to stop race cars if they run off the track.

Most race tracks are a closed loop. The start and finish line is at the same place. Some tracks are "open". They start at one point and end at a different location. 

 Some race track are in the general form of a circle or oval. Michigan International Speedway is an example of an oval track. The racers always turn in the same direction. In the United States, they normally turn left. NASCAR runs most of its races on oval tracks.

 Some race tracks are called road courses. The racers turn both left and right. Donington Park in England is an example of a road course. Formula One runs most of its races on road courses. These types of tracks are often called "circuits", especially in Europe.

Some races tracks are temparary street courses. Regular public roads are temporally closed, and the race couse it set-up using the closed roads. One of the most famous street course is Circuit de Monaco. Every year, the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix is held on this course. These types of tracks are usually called "circuits".

<doc id="256798" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=256798" title="County jail">
County jail

The term "county jail" is used in the United States for jails maintained to hold prisoners in each of the many county divisions of a U.S. state. People will be moved into a county jail from various "city jails", or from being handcuffed to building structures after they are arrested. A county jail is often larger, or more secure, than many city jails (depending on the size of the city). Also, a county jail may include many buildings, or various branches, perhaps miles apart from each other.

Typically, each county jail is maintained by a "sheriff's department" run by the current sheriff and his deputy officers. They form a separate group from the city police, or town police departments, in a county.

In accordance with legal rights, a county jail will have some private cells to hold especially violent or controversial suspects, to protect others from them or them from being targeted by the "general population" of the jail. Also, a county jail will be subject to medical or health restrictions, such as providing air conditioners or Kosher foods, since many detainees are still presumed innocent and are not yet proven to be "criminals". Some innocent people might wait 2 years in a county jail, awaiting a criminal trial, while unable to bond out by posting a "bail bond" (depending on the nature of the criminal charges against them).

When people are convicted of a felony, then they will be moved from the county jail (perhaps within a few days) to a "state prison" (or "penitentiary") which typically only contains convicted people (and only relatively few of them would be actually innocent by being misjudged as "guilty"). Hence, the U.S. state prisons typically contain mostly "hardened criminals" who have actually committed numerous major crimes, while a county jail might contain many innocent people, or first-time offenders, who do not have a severe criminal mindset.

Because the prisons (or penitentiaries) are for punishment of offenders (convicted felons), the living conditions might be lower, such as lacking air conditioning or heating, or having poor food. Also, some convicts, imprisoned for 1 or more years, might be likely to steal from others, so each person might be allowed to have a padlock to put food in a locker, but there is no guarantee that others would not threaten or trick a person to open the locker to allow items to be taken by force or distraction. In the county jail, people are held for court sessions or punishment of misdemeanors (lesser offenses), so there is less chance of meeting hardened thieves. However, a prison puts many convicts to work, to reduce the labor cost of maintaining the prison, so each convict might have more ability to move around the prison complex, compared to inmates in a county jail, where most of them might not be working but simply waiting to be freed.

For those reasons, a county jail is often very different, as to both structure and occupants, from a prison.

Circle MRT Line

The 35.7-kilometre Circle MRT Line (CCL) is Singapore's 4th rapid transit line, and the 1st Singapore's medium capacity line. It is being built in five parts of which the section from Bartley to Dhoby Ghaut is operational. As the name implies, the line is an orbital line linking all radial lines leading to the city, and also covering many parts of the Central Area. It will also connect to Marina South via a spur line branching off from Promenade and ending at Marina Bay. Circle Line is not a full circle, and the Stage 6 will only merge the section from Marina Bay to HarbourFront.

The first part opened to the public from Bartley to Marymount on May 28, 2009. When finished, the line will connect all MRT lines, and will allow passengers to bypass the downtown area, so that the City Hall and Raffles Place interchange stations will be less crowded. The second part opened to the public from Bartley to Dhoby Ghaut on April 17, 2010 while the remaining parts will be opened in 2011. Only the Marina Bay Extension will be opened in 2012.

Marlboro (cigarette)

Marlboro (, or ) is the largest selling brand of cigarettes in the world. It is made by Philip Morris USA (a branch of Altria) within the US, and by Philip Morris International (now separate from Altria) outside the US. It is famous for its billboard advertisements and magazine ads of the Marlboro Man. 

Marlboro is also known for its sponsorship of auto racing. This started in with its sponsorship of Formula One teams BRM and Iso Marlboro-Ford. 

For season Marlboro ended its sponsorship of both teams. Marlboro became associated with the McLaren team. Marlboro ended their sponsorship of McLaren in , which ended the famous red and white McLaren livery.

Marlboro also sponsored Scuderia Ferrari as secondary sponsor starting in 1980s Ferrari company president Enzo Ferrari refused to allow "outside" sponsor brands to appear on his team cars. After Enzo Ferrari's death in 1988, Marlboro began to take over as the primary sponsor. Later the team was officially named Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro. 

In September 2005, Ferrari signed an extension of their sponsorship arrangement with Marlboro until 2011. This came at a time when tobacco sponsorship was being banned in many location. It had become illegal in the European Union, including F1 races. Other major teams have withdrawn from relationships with tobacco companies. In April 2008, the Marlboro logo was displayed on the Ferrari for the last time. 

Marlboro then replaced the logo with a variety of barcodes. Leading health officials called for a review of the barcode advertising . The Ferrari team claims the barcode is part of the car design, not an advertising message. The controversial barcode designed was recently removed by Ferrari for the start of the Spanish Grand Prix.

Marlboro also sponsored the Alfa Romeo Formula One team between and .
Since their start in Formula One, Marlboro has also sponsored numerous teams and races.
Marlboro sponsorship in Champ Car (also known as 'CART' and 'IndyCar' at that time) dates back to 1986. The Penske cars in the Indy Racing League (IRL) currently run in Marlboro's distinctive red and white colors. In 2006, a Marlboro-sponsored car won the Indianapolis 500. For the 2007 season, Marlboro had ended their sponsorship of the Penske Cars. The Penske team will retain the color scheme. Where 'Marlboro Penske' appeared on the side of the cars, 'Team Penske' replaced it. Although Marlboro does not sponsor Team Penske, Philip Morris USA is still Team Penske's main sponsor.

Marlboro also sponsored the Australian Marlboro Holden Dealer Team from 1974 through to 1984. The Marlboro branding gave rise to some of Australia's most prominently recognizable race cars such as the L34 and A9X Torana, as well as the VK Group C "Big Banger" Commodore.

In Motorcycling Grand Prix, Marlboro sponsored the Yamaha team in 500cc and 250cc class. Marlboro currently sponsors the Ducati MotoGP. As of the 2009 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season, they are only allowed to put the Marlboro brand the bikes in Qatar.

Marlboro also has a long history in rallying sponsorship, including with the factory World Rally Championship teams of Toyota, Mitsubishi, and Peugeot. During the 2007 GP2 Series Season, ART Grand Prix was also sponsored by Marlboro. 

Marlboro are generally credited as being among the most important of sponsors to the world of Formula 1 (and motor racing in general) in terms of the amount of financial backing given to various competitors. In mid-2006, special "racing editions" of Marlboro Red were sold in the UK, with a Ferrari-inspired design, although the Ferrari name and badge were not used.

Maxwell's Silver Hammer

"Maxwell's Silver Hammer" is a song by The Beatles, from the "Abbey Road" album, with Paul McCartney singing lead vocals. It was written by McCartney, though the songwriting credit is Lennon/McCartney.

The vaudevillian-style song is about medical student Maxwell Edison, who uses his silver hammer to murder his girlfriend Joan, then his teacher, and finally the judge during his murder trial. Despite the grim subject matter, the song is bouncy and upbeat (a "happy song about a serial killer").

McCartney said in 1994 that it symbolizes the failures of life:

McCartney referred to the song when talking about his 2005 album "Chaos and Creation in the Backyard":

"Maxwell's Silver Hammer" is a song by The Beatles, from the "Abbey Road" album, with Paul McCartney singing lead. It was written by McCartney, though the songwriting credit is Lennon/McCartney.

After resuming to record the "Abbey Road" album, the Beatles began recording Maxwell's Silver Hammer at Abbey Road Studios on July 9, 1969. McCartney, Harrison and Starr taped 16 takes of the song, followed by a series of guitar overdubs.

The following two days the group overdubbed vocals, piano, Hammond organ, anvil and guitar. The song was completed on August 6, when McCartney recorded a solo on a Moog synthesizer.

John Lennon later said, "I hate it...He did everything to make it into a single, and it never was and it never could have been."

George Harrison described it in 1969 as "one of those instant whistle-along tunes which some people hate, and other people really like. It's a fun song, but it's kind of a drag because Maxwell keeps on destroying everyone like his girlfriend then the school teacher, and then, finally, the judge." In 1977 Harrison was more candid, describing it as "so fruity" but added "we did a good job on it". 

The length of time it took to record the song created tension between the Beatles. Paul McCartney said: "The only arguments were about things like me spending three days on Maxwell's Silver Hammer. I remember George saying, 'You've taken three days, it's only a song.' - 'Yeah, but I want to get it right. I've got some thoughts on this one.' It was early-days Moog work and it did take a bit of time".


For the studio version of the song, the anvil was played by Starr; in the Beatles film "Let It Be", however, Mal Evans is seen hitting the anvil as the Beatles play the track.

Oh! Darling

"Oh! Darling" is a song of The Beatles written by Paul McCartney (credited to Lennon/McCartney) and is the fourth song on the "Abbey Road" album.

McCartney later said, "When we were recording 'Oh! Darling' I came into the studios early every day for a week to sing it by myself because at first my voice was too clear. I wanted it to sound as though I'd been performing it on stage all week."

In a 1980 interview with "Playboy" magazine, John Lennon said, "'Oh! Darling' was a great one of Paul's that he didn't sing too well. I always thought I could have done it better—it was more my style than his. He wrote it, so what the hell, he's going to sing it."

George Harrison described the song as "a typical 1950s–'60s-period song because of its chord structure."

After an early attempt at this song on 27 January 1969 during the "Let It Be" sessions, Lennon announced, "Just heard that Yoko's divorce has just gone through", after which he and the band burst into an improvised version of the song, singing "I'm free at last" instead of a part of the lyric.

Octopus's Garden

"Octopus's Garden" is a song by The Beatles written by Ringo Starr from their 1969 album "Abbey Road".

George Harrison worked on the song with Ringo Starr; perhaps out of solidarity as his own songs being dismissed by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Harrison commented: "'Octopus's Garden' is Ringo's song. It's only the second song Ringo has ever written, mind you, and it's lovely." He added that the song gets very deep into your consciousness "because it's so peaceful. I suppose Ringo is writing cosmic songs these days without even realising it."

The idea for the song came about when Ringo Starr was on a boat belonging to comedian Peter Sellers in Sardinia in 1968. He ordered fish and chips for lunch, but instead of fish he got squid (it was the first time he'd eaten squid, and he said, "It was OK. A bit rubbery. Tasted like chicken.") Then the boat's captain told Ringo Starr about how octopuses travel along the sea bed picking up stones and shiny objects to build gardens. The "Let It Be" film had a scene where George Harrison is shown helping Ringo Starr work the song out on piano.

The song, which contains the lyrics "Oh what joy for every girl and boy / Knowing they're happy and they're safe," is sometimes thought of as being a song for children, like "Yellow Submarine", "The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill" or "All Together Now". It has also been performed by the Muppets several times in episodes of their shows.

The basic instrumental track was recorded April 26, 1969, with the lineup of two electric guitars (Harrison and John Lennon), bass guitar (Paul McCartney), and drums (Starr). George Martin did not produce the song, so the Beatles themselves were listed as producer, with Martin's apprentice Chris Thomas present in the control room to help. Thirty-two takes were required before the Beatles were happy with the song.

The backing vocals by McCartney and Harrison during the guitar solo were put through compressors and limiters to create a gurgling sound. Harrison added the sound of bubbles being blown into a glass of milk using a straw.

I Want You (She's So Heavy)

"I Want You (She's So Heavy)" is a song by The Beatles from their album "Abbey Road". It was written by John Lennon, although it is credited to Lennon/McCartney.

The song is an unusual Beatles song for many reasons, its length (nearly eight minutes), small number of lyrics (only fourteen different words are sung), three-minute descent through the same repeated guitar chords, and sudden ending. It is also one of the last songs that the Beatles mixed as a group, on August 20, 1969.

Here Comes the Sun

"Here Comes the Sun" is a song by George Harrison from The Beatles' 1969 album "Abbey Road". 

Harrison stated in "The Beatles Anthology": 

Harrison, McCartney and Starr recorded the song in 13 takes on July 7, 1969. John Lennon did not contribute to the song as he was recovering from a car crash. Towards the end of the session, Harrison spent an hour re-recording his acoustic guitar part. Harrison capoed his guitar on the 7th fret, resulting the final key of A major. He also used the same technique on his 1965 song "If I Needed Someone," which shares a similar melodic pattern. The following day he taped his lead vocals, and he and McCartney recorded their backing vocals twice to give a fuller sound.

A harmonium and handclaps were added on July 16. Harrison's guitar solo was overdubbed on 6 August, and the orchestral parts were added on 15 August. "Here Comes the Sun" was completed four days later with the addition of Harrison's Moog synthesizer part.

Order of the Arrow

The Order of the Arrow is an honor society in the Boy Scouts of America. It was started by E. Urner Goodman in 1915. Members of the Order of the Arrow are called Arrowmen or Brothers. The Order of the Arrow uses American Indian symbols and lore. There are some "secret" ceremonies and words.

To be chosen to join the Order, youth members need to be voted in by their Scout troop, and have to have the First Class rank or higher. Adult leaders can also be chosen.

People who are entering the Order have to go through what is called an Ordeal. They have to go through a 24 hour period where they sleep outside, do not get much food, cannot talk, and do work, such as to help the camp where the Ordeal is happening.

Once someone goes through the Ordeal and becomes a member of the Order, they are called an Ordeal member. They can later become what is called a "Brotherhood member" after giving more service and going through another ceremony. Some Brotherhood members can later become "Vigil Members", but usually, no more than one out of every fifty people in a Lodge (local groups of the Order of the Arrow) can become Vigil Members.

<doc id="257006" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=257006" title="Lingua franca">
Lingua franca

A lingua franca (originally Italian for "Frankish language" - see etymology below) is a language that is used between persons who have not the same mother tongue.

The terms working language, bridge language and vehicular language are used in the same sense.

Around the Renaissance era a mixed language of Italian (80%) and many words from Turkish, French, Spanish, Greek and Arabic was used in the eastern region around the Mediterranean Sea It was in use as the language of commerce and diplomacy and was called lingua franca. At that time, in the port cities of the Ottoman empire there lived very many Italian speakers. "Franca" was the Italian word for "Frankish". Its usage in the term "lingua franca" came from its meaning in Arabic. That word came into use before the Crusades, when Europeans used to be called "Franks" or "Faranji" in Arabic. The term "lingua franca" is first recorded in English in 1678.

There are many languages in all continents that are used as lingua franca. 

In Africa: Afrikaans, Berber, Fanagalo, Fula, Hausa, Krio, Manding, Sango, Swahili, Wolof

In Asia: Akkadian, Arabic, Aramaic, Azeri, Bengali, Chinese, Hebrew, Hindi-Urdu, Malay-Indonesian, Nepali, Persian, Sanskrit

In Europe: English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Latin, Polish,
Portuguese, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, Yiddish

In Pre-Columbian America: Chinook Jargon, Nahuatl, Quechua, Tupi
Pidgins and creoles: Guinea-Bissau Creole, Tok Pisin

For some of them some explanations may be given. 

English is the current "lingua franca" of international business, science, technology and aviation. It has replaced French as the lingua franca of diplomacy since World War II. The rise of English in diplomacy began in 1919, after World War I, when the Treaty of Versailles was written in English as well as in French. The use of English profited from the important international role of English-speaking nations (the United States and the Commonwealth of Nations) after World War II, particularly in the establishment and organization of the United Nations. English is one of the six official languages of the United Nations (the other five are French, Arabic, Chinese, Russian and Spanish). 

When the United Kingdom became a colonial power, English was the "lingua franca" of the colonies of the British Empire. In the post-colonial period, some of the newly created nations which had many indigenous languages decided to continue using English as the lingua franca to avoid the political difficulties that had developed if one had decided to use only one of the indigenous languages. 

French was the language of diplomacy in Europe from the 17th century, and as a result is still a working language of international institutions and is seen on documents ranging from passports to airmail letters. For many years, until the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Denmark joined in 1973, French and German were the only official working languages of the European Economic Community. French was also the lingua franca of European literature in the 18th century.

German served as a "lingua franca" in large portions of Europe for centuries, mainly the Holy Roman Empire. 

As it was one of the official languages of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, German remained an important second language in much of Central and Eastern Europe long after World War I. Today, it is still the most common second language in some of the countries in the region (e.g. in Slovenia (45% of the pop.), Croatia (34%), the Czech Republic (31%) and Slovakia (28%)). In others, it is also known by significant numbers of the population (in Poland by 18%, in Hungary by 16%).

During the time of the Roman Empire, the "lingua franca"s were Greek and Latin. During the Middle Ages, the "lingua franca" was Greek in the parts of Europe, Middle East and Northern Africa where the Byzantine Empire had much influence, and Latin was used in the rest of Europe. Latin was used as the common language of the Roman Catholic Church. During the Second Vatican Council, Catholic liturgy changed to local languages, although Latin remains the official language of the Vatican. Latin was used as the language of scholars in Europe until the early 19th century in most subjects.

Sauber

Sauber F1 Team is a Swiss Formula One team. It was founded in the 1970s by Peter Sauber. The team ran its first Formula One in .

Sauber was an independent team, it did not have the backing of a automobile manufacuer such as Ferrari. Having not won a single Grand Prix race, the team was sold to BMW in 2005. The team competed as BMW Sauber from 2006 to 2009, and won one race. At the end of the 2009 season, BMW deceided to leave Formula One. 

The race team's future was uncertain for several months. BMW sold the team back to Peter Sauber which allowed the team to race in entry. Due to issues with the Formula One contract, the team name will remain BMW Sauber for the 2010 season.

Since the 1970s, Peter Sauber built sports cars. After using turbocharged Mercedes V8 engines in the 1980s, his team became the official factory team of Mercedes-Benz, reviving the Silver Arrow legend. They won the 24 hours of Le Mans and the World Sportscar Championship in 1989 and 1990, competing against Jaguar and Porsche. 
Mercedes-Benz had planed to enter Formula One with Sauber. They could not work out all the details, so Mercedes withdrew their formal support. Mercedes continued to fund Sauber's Formula One project unofficially. The Sauber team was powered by V10 Ilmor engines in a chassis named the C12. This continued the Sauber's naming policy from the sports car days. The 'C' was a reference to Peter Sauber's wife, Christine. The cars were driven by JJ Lehto and Karl Wendlinger.

The Sauber racing debut took place in the first race of the season in South Africa. The car finished in fifth place, earning two points under the scoring system at the time. Over the remainder of the season the team rarely saw the finish of a race due to unreliability and racing accidents. When the team did finish a race, they were often in the top ten. Sauber ended the season with twelve points, seventh out of the thirteen original entries.

The team competed in the season as Sauber Mercedes, now officially Mercedes' factory team. Their new car was the Sauber C13 and the Ilmor engine was re-badged (given a new name) as the Mercedes 3.5 V10. Former Sauber sports car driver Heinz Harald Frentzen was Karl Wendlinger's new team mate.

Early performance was disappointingly, delivering similar results as the previous year. They only scoring a few points in the opening rounds. Things got worse after the tragic deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix. Wendlinger was seriously injured in a crash during practice for the Monaco Grand Prix. He suffered serious head injuries and was unable to race for the of the season. Wendlinger was replaced by Andrea de Cesaris. After Lehto had been released by Benetton, he drove for Sauber the last two races of the season.

Sauber finished the season with twelve points and eighth out of the fourteen original teams entered. Mercedes were unhappy with the progress of Sauber and left the team at the end of the year.

For , Sauber start the beginning of a ten year sponsorship deal with energy drink giant Red Bull. Dietrich Mateschitz had purchased a majority share in the team. Fritz Kaiser joined the team as the commercial director. The Sauber C14 used a factory supply of Ford-Cosworth. The 1995 season saw the return of Karl Wendlinger and Heinz Harald Frentzen as the drivers. Wendlinger's accident in 1994 seemed to have reduced his driving potential and he was replaced rookie Jean-Christophe Boullion.

The team finished on a record 18 points despite the under-performing Ford engine. They also climbed back up to seventh in the constructor's championship.

In 1995, Petronas become Sauber's presenting sponsor. They renewed their association in 2007, by which time the team had changed ownership.

Sauber used Ferrari designed engines from 1997 to 2005. They were built by Sauber Petronas Engineering, a company founded for purpose of building these engines. The engines were nearly identical to the ones used by Ferrari. Sauber Petronas Engineering also built the gearboxes used by Sauber. Sauber licensed nearly every part they could from Ferrari. Sauber even had several Ferrari engineers on staff. Suspicious similarities between Ferrari and Sauber chassis were pointed out, but no formal accusations were ever made. The FIA rules require each team to design their own chassis.

In Sauber brought a virtually unknown and very inexperienced Kimi Räikkönen into Formula One. There were protests by a few drivers and members of the FIA, including Max Mosley. They believed Räikkönen would pose a danger to other drivers. His good performance that year proved the Sauber decision right. Räikkönen would later go on to win the Drivers Championship with Ferrari. 

In its later years, Sauber's ties with Ferrari became weaker. They sided with the other teams over planned rule changes. Then they decided to switch to Michelin tyres, while Ferrari continued to use Bridgestones. Sauber's final grand prix came in China. Sauber departed F1 with their best results; six third places and two front row starts. 

Among the notable Sauber drivers were Jean Alesi, Formula One championship runner-up Felipe Massa, Johnny Herbert and World Champion Jacques Villeneuve. Two former Sauber drivers, Nick Heidfeld and Jacques Villeneuve, drove for the new BMW Sauber team in 2006. BMW ownership of Sauber started on January 1, 2006.

At the end of the 2005 season the team was bought by BMW and was renamed BMW Sauber. Peter Sauber retaining a 20% stake in the team. BMW sold its share of BMW Sauber back to Peter Sauber after the end of the 2009 season. Because of their contract with Formula One, the team still formally uses the name 'BMW Sauber' in competitions for .

For the season the team signed Nick Heidfeld from Williams to be their lead driver, and retained Jacques Villeneuve as the second driver. Polish Robert Kubica was signed as the team's third or test driver. The team continued to use Sauber's facilities, mostly for chassis construction and wind tunnel testing. BMW's headquarters in Munich was responsible for building the new P86 V8 engine.

Former Sauber title sponsor Petronas renewed their contract with the new team, as a simple team sponsor, as did Credit Suisse. BMW Sauber announced a technical partnership with Intel and the Germany company O2, saying that it will lead to technological improvements on BMW road cars. The new livery (paint scheme), unveiled in Valencia on 17 January 2006, was the traditional BMW blue and white with a hint of red.

At the Hungarian Grand Prix, Heidfeld scored the team's first podium. Kubica filled in for Villeneuve. Villeneuve could not drive due to complications following his accident at the German Grand Prix. Kubica finished seventh, but was disqualified for having too light a car. Kubica would drive for the rest of the season, bringing an to Villeneuve's F1 career.

The team's finished the season fifth place in the constructor's championship with 36 points.


For the season Kubica and Heidfeld were again the teams' drivers. Sebastian Vettel would be the third or test driver. Timo Glock was signed as the team's second test driver. 

The performance of the BMW Sauber's F1.08 firmly placed them as the best team behind the two championship leading teams of Ferrari and McLaren. 

The Canadian Grand Prix brought the teams best finish to date, with Nick Heidfeld finishing in 2nd place, but Robert Kubica had a huge crash that resulted in a sprained ankle and concussion.

Sebastian Vettel took his place in the United States Grand Prix and finishing in 8th place. He became the youngest driver to score a Formula One World Championship point. After the European Grand Prix, Scuderia Toro Rosso announced that Vettel would take the second driver seat from Scott Speed.
On August 21, 2007, BMW confirmed its driver line-up of Nick Heidfeld and Robert Kubica for the season. Their 2008 car, the BMW Sauber F1.08 was officially launched in Munich on January 14, 2008. 

In Bahrain, Kubica scored his and the team's first ever pole position, beating Felipe Massa by just under three hundredths of a second. The team went on to finish 3rd and 4th in the race, equaling their highest round of points scored. For the first time, the team was in first place in the constructors' championship.

BMW Sauber's first race victory came in the Canadian Grand Prix. BMS Sauber scored a one-two finish with Robert Kubica's first race win and Nick Heidfeld taking second place. This was the first Formula One victory for a BMW engine since the Williams-BMW won the Brazilian Grand Prix.

After the team's breakthrough win, the team stopped improving the current car. They started work on the new car for because of the new regulations for the next season. This was reflected in the team's performance for the remainder of the 2008 season. Kubica was leading the drivers championship after the Canadian Grand Prix. The lack of development was showed with a drop in performance through the second half of the season. BMW was outpaced by Renault, Toyota and Toro Rosso

In October 2008 the team confirmed that they would stay with Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld as their drivers for the Season.

Although BMW Sauber targeted the 2009 season as the year they would challenge for the title, their start to the season was disappointing. Kubica was in 3rd place in the opening round, when he collided with Vettel while battling for 2nd place. Kubica was forced to retire from the race. Heidfeld secured the team's first podium of the year in Malaysia, but after 6 races BMW Sauber had collected only 6 points. They were in 8th place in the Constructors' Championship out of 10 teams. 

Several upgrades were scheduled for Turkey, including an improved energy recovery braking system (KERS) and a new air diffuser to improve downforce and traction. While the new diffuser was installed, the KERS would not fit the new car and both drivers raced without the device. BMW had been one of the strongest supports of KERS. After the the British Grand Prix, the team announced they would stop development KERS. They set their focus on improving the car's aerodynamics (how well the car moves through the air). This left Ferrari and McLaren as the only remaining users of the KERS system. In the European Grand Prix at Valencia Robert Kubica scored the team's first points since the race in Turkey.

On July 28, the company announced the team's withdrawal from Formula One at the end of 2009. BMW Chairman Dr. Norbert Reithofer described the decision as a strategic one. On 15 September 2009 BMW Sauber announced they had a buyer for the team, Qadbak Investments Limited. Qadbak turned to be a shell company (a company without any real assets or operations), and the deal fell apart. 

Lotus Racing was given the 13th and final slot in the Season.

On November 27, 2009 Peter Sauber announced he would purchase the team back from BMW. He would only agree to the purchase if the team receiving a FIA entry for the season.

On December 3, 2009, the FIA confirmed that Sauber had been granted the entry position left by Toyota's departure from Formula one.. The new Sauber team would be using Ferrari engines, and the team's chassis for the 2010 season would be designated Sauber C29. Peter Sauber said that he has not applied to change the name of the team, so they remain for now as "BMW Sauber F1 Team" despite using no BMW components. 

Kamui Kobayashi was signed as a driver for the 2010 season on the December 17, 2009. Pedro de la Rosa was signed as Sauber's second driver on January 19, 2010. Esteban Gutiérrez has joined the team as an observer for some race weekends. He has been placed on the same training program as the race drivers de la Rosa and Kobayashi.

The team struggled in the early rounds of the season, and did not score any points from the first three races. Peter Sauber admitted at this point that his decision to rescue the team had been emotionally-driven, but insisted that it was a correct decision.

The team ran without a primary sponsor for the first four races of the 2010 season. For the Spanish and European Grand Prix, they carried the logo of the Spanish arm of the Burger King fast food franchise. 

In Turkey, Kobayashi qualified in the top ten for the race, then finished 10th, collecting the team's first point in 2010.

On 14 September, Sauber anounced that Nick Heidfeld had been signed to replace de la Rosa for the rest of the 2010 season. Heidfeld drove for Sauber from to , and to . Heidfeld will race starting with the Singapore Grand Prix.

For the season, Sauber kept driver Kamui Kobayashi, and added rookie driver Sergio Pérez. Kobayashi qualified in 9th place, and Pérez in 13th. Pérez received praise for making his tyres last better than any other driver. He needed only one pit stop, when all other drivers needed at least two. They both finished the race in the points. Pérez finished in 7th place, and Kobayashi in 8th. The two Sauber cars were disqualified after the race. The team had made a mistake with the rear wing, and it was not legal.

Pérez suffered a serious crash in the Monaco race. He had intentions of being in the next race, at Canada, and ran in the Friday practice. However, Pérez fell ill (sick) and was replaced by Pedro de la Rosa.

Lawrence, Kansas

Lawrence is a city in the state of Kansas in the United States. It is in the northeastern part of the state, near the Kansas City area, and is in Douglas County. In 2009, about 92,000 people lived there. The University of Kansas and Haskell Indian Nations University are in Lawrence.

In 1854, a group of people who were against slavery started Lawrence. (This was before Kansas became a state. Kansas did not become a state until January 29, 1861.) Many people had moved to Kansas because a law called the Kansas-Nebraska Act said that people could vote on whether slavery would be allowed there or not.

A newspaper was started in 1854 called the "Kansas Pioneer". The writers of the newspapers wrote about their beliefs that slavery was wrong.

On August 21, 1863, a man named William Quantrill, who wanted slavery to be legal, rode into Lawrence with some men and destroyed much of the town. They killed every adult man they saw. More than 150 men died.

Hilo, Hawaii

Hilo () is the second-largest CDP in the State of Hawaii and the largest settlement on the island of Hawaii with a population of 40,759 during the 2000 census.

Hilo is the county seat of Hawaii County, Hawaii, and is situated in the South Hilo District. The town overlooks Hilo Bay, and is near two shield volcanoes, Mauna Loa, considered active, and Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano upon which some of the best ground-based astronomical observatories are placed. 

Hilo is home to the University of Hawaii at Hilo, as well as the Merrie Monarch Festival, a week-long celebration of ancient and modern hula, which takes place every year after Easter. It is also home to the Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corporation, one of the world's leading producers of macadamia nuts. It is served by Hilo International Airport, inside the CDP.

Although there is not much archaeological evidence, people lived in the areas along Hilo Bay, Wailuku and Wailoa Rivers before the Western world made contact. They were known as the Hilo. They dominated the high mountaintops until the middle 1800s. Hilo means high mountaintop in the original language of the native peoples who lived on the mountaintops. King Kamehameha, the first king of Hawaii, conquered all the islands and then moved the Hilo mountain settlement to the shore after the arrival of outsiders.

Originally, the name Hilo applied to the whole district of Hilo, now divided into South Hilo District and North Hilo District. When William Ellis visited in 1823, the main settlement in Hilo district was Waiākea on Hilo Bay. Missionaries came to the district in the early to middle 1800s, founding several churches, notably Haili Church, in the area of modern Hilo.

Hilo expanded as sugar plantations in the surrounding area created new jobs and drew in many workers from Asia, making the city a trading center.

A breakwater across Hilo Bay was begun in the 1900s and completed in 1929. On April 1, 1946, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake near the Aleutian Islands created a fourteen-meter high tsunami that hit Hilo 4.9 hours later, killing 160 people. In response an early warning system, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, was established in 1949 to track these killer waves and provide warning. This tsunami also meant the end of the Hawaii Consolidated Railway, and instead the Hawaii Belt Road was built north of Hilo using some of the railbed.

On May 23, 1960, another tsunami, caused by a 9.5 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Chile the previous day, claimed 61 lives allegedly due to people's failure to heed warning sirens. Low-lying bayfront areas of the city on Waiākea peninsula and along Hilo Bay, previously populated, were rededicated as parks and memorials.

Hilo is located at (19.705520, -155.085918).

Hilo is classified by the United States Census Bureau as a census-designated place (CDP), and has a total area of , of which is land and of which (7.10%) is water.
Hilo features a tropical rainforest climate (Koppen "Af"), with substantial rainfall throughout the course of the year. Hilo's location on the eastern side of the island of Hawaii (windward relative to the trade winds) makes it the wettest city in the United States and one of the wettest cities in the world. An average of around of rain fell at Hilo International Airport annually between 1971–2000, with 275 days of the year receiving some rain. At some other weather stations in Hilo the annual rainfall is above .

Monthly avergage temperatures range from in January to in August. The highest recorded temperature was on May 20, 1996, and the lowest on February 21, 1962. The wettest year was 1994 with and the driest year was 1983 with . The most rainfall in one month was in December 1954. The most rainfall in 24 hours was on November 2, 2000. 

Hilo's location on the shore of the funnel-shaped Hilo Bay also makes it vulnerable to tsunamis.

There are many educational institutions in Hilo. Some of these are: two post-secondary institutions, the University of Hawaii at Hilo and Hawaii Community College.

Lennon/McCartney

The songwriting duo of John Lennon and Paul McCartney is one of the best-known and most successful musical partnership in history. Between 1962 and 1969, they wrote about 180 credited songs. Most of the songs were recorded by The Beatles. Other songs credited to Lennon–McCartney were originally released not by the Beatles but by other artists, especially those managed by Brian Epstein. Recording a Lennon–McCartney song helped start new artists' careers. For example, one of The Rolling Stones' first singles, "I Wanna Be Your Man", was a Lennon–McCartney song.

Birmingham Triennial Music Festival

The Birmingham Triennial Musical Festival was a festival of classical music that used to be held in Birmingham, England. It was started in 1784 and continued until 1912. “Triennial” means that it happened once every three years.

The first music festival was held for three days in September 1768. It helped to raise money to complete the new General Hospital on Summer Lane. Another festival was held in 1778 to get more money. The hospital opened in September 1779.

From September 1784 the festival was held every three years. It continued to raise money for the hospital.

The church and theatre where the festival was held became too small, so in 1834 they built Birmingham Town Hall which had much more room.

Many famous musicians performed at the festival. In 1837 Felix Mendelssohn conducted a performance of his oratorio "St. Paul", played the organ, and played the piano part in the first performance of his Piano Concerto No. 2 which had been especially commissioned by the Festival. In the next festival he played his Piano Concerto No. 1. In 1846 (a year before he died) the festival commissioned him to write his oratorio "Elijah". It was a huge success. He was paid 200 guineas. "Elijah" was played at every festival after that. 

The festival commissioned other composers to write works, these included: Arthur Sullivan, Max Bruch, Charles Gounod and Antonín Dvořák.

The great conductor Hans Richter was made principal conductor in 1885.

Edward Elgar wrote several works for the festival. In 1900 his oratorio "The Dream of Gerontius" was given its first performance. In 1903 he performed "The Apostles", and 1906 "The Kingdom". In 1912 he wrote "The Music Makers". The principal conductor for 1912 was Henry Wood.

The 1909 and 1912 festivals lost a lot of money and they could not give any money to the hospital. This was soon followed by World War I, so the festival stopped and did not continue after the war.

You Never Give Me Your Money

"You Never Give Me Your Money" is a song by The Beatles that opens the medley on side two of the album "Abbey Road". It was written by Paul McCartney and is credited to Lennon/McCartney.

The Beatles recorded 26 takes of "You Never Give Me Your Money" on May 6, 1969, with McCartney on piano and vocals, Lennon and Harrison on guitar and Starr on drums. 

On July 1, McCartney overdubbed lead vocals onto take 30, and added more vocals and chimes on July 15.

"You Never Give Me Your Money" was originally to transition into "Sun King" with a long organ note. This was recorded along with more vocals on July 30. They were scrapped the following day, when McCartney completed the song by adding bass guitar and piano. The "Sun King" crossfade was completed on August 5 with a series of tape loops containing the sounds of bells, birds, bubbles and insects.

Sun King (song)

"Sun King" is a song written by John Lennon but credited to Lennon/McCartney and recorded by The Beatles for their "Abbey Road" album. 

The working title was "Here Comes the Sun King", but was shortened to "Sun King" to avoid confusion with the song "Here Comes the Sun". The song is in three-part harmony, sung by Lennon, Paul McCartney, and Harrison. At the end of the song, the music stops abruptly and a Ringo Starr drum fill leads into the next track, "Mean Mr. Mustard".

The mixing of Romance languages occurs in the last three lines of the song. In 1969, Lennon was interviewed about these lyrics and said, "We just started joking, you know, singing 'cuando para mucho.' So we just made up... Paul knew a few Spanish words from school, you know. So we just strung any Spanish words that sounded vaguely like something. And of course we got 'chicka ferdy' in. That's a Liverpool expression. Just like sort of-- it doesn't mean anything to me but (childish taunting) 'na-na, na-na-na!'"

In 1976, The Bee Gees covered the song for the musical documentary "All This and World War II".

Mean Mr. Mustard

"Mean Mr. Mustard" is a song written by John Lennon (credited to Lennon/McCartney) and performed by The Beatles on their album, "Abbey Road". The "Abbey Road" version was recorded with "Sun King" in one continuous piece.

Written in India, Lennon said that the song was inspired by a newspaper story about a miser who hid his cash wherever he could so he can stop people from making him spend it. On reflection, he didn't think highly of the composition, describing it in "Anthology" as "a bit of crap I wrote in India."

A demo version of the song was recorded in May 1968 at Kinfauns, George Harrison's home in Esher, and appears on Anthology 3. In that version, Mustard's sister is named Shirley. Lennon changed it to Pam when he saw the ochance to ease the segue into the song "Polythene Pam", which is after "Mean Mr. Mustard" on the album. According to Lennon, "In 'Mean Mr. Mustard', I said 'his sister Pam'—originally it was 'his sister Shirley' in the lyric. I changed it to Pam to make it sound like it had something to do with it." Additionally, the original version of the song was a quieter acoustic rendition and was over 4 minutes in length.

The version in the "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" film was performed by Mean Mr. Mustard (played by Frankie Howerd) and his evil robot companions named the Computerettes. As with the performance of "She's Leaving Home" also in the film, the computerized singing of the Computerettes was performed by the Bee Gees.

The Magnificat is the song that the Virgin Mary sang when she was told by the angel that she was going to give birth to God's son in Christian mythology. This is the story told in the Bible in the book of Luke Chapter 1,verses 46-55. It is also known as the Song of Mary. "Magnificat" is a Latin word meaning "magnifies" (i.e. saying how great (God) is).

The words of the Magnificat have been set to music by many composers. These musical settings were mostly written for church services. In the Anglican Church it is always sung as part of the traditional evening service (Evensong).

Like all other New Testament texts the "Magnificat" was originally written in Koine Greek, but in the Western Church it is most often to be found in Latin or the language of the country.

The Latin text from the Vulgate is as follows:

The Nunc dimittis is a hymn from the Bible. It was sung by Simeon when he saw the baby Jesus. 

The story told in the book of Luke was that Simeon, who was a Jew, had been promised by the Holy Ghost that he would not die until he had seen Jesus. When Mary and Joseph brought the baby Jesus to the Temple in Jerusalem for the ceremony of consecration of the firstborn son, Simeon was there, and he took Jesus into his arms and said the words which are now known as the Nunc dimittis. He was saying to God that he could now die happily because he had seen the Saviour.

The words of the Nunc dimittis have been set to music by many composers. In the Anglican Church they are traditionally sung at Evensong.

Zangalewa

“Tsaminamina” or “Zangaléwa” is a 1986 hit song, originally sung by a makossa group from Cameroon called Golden Sounds who were beloved throughout the continent for their silly dances and costumes. The song was such a hit for Golden Sounds that they eventually changed their name to Zangaléwa, too.The song pays tribute to African skirmishers (a.k.a tirailleurs) during WW2. Most of the band members were in the Cameroonian Army themselves and used make up, fake belly and fake butt for comic relief.

The song is still used today almost everywhere in Africa by soldiers, policemen, boy scouts, sportsmen and their supporters, usually during training or for rallying. It is also widely used in schools throughout the continent especially in Cameroon as a marching song and almost everyone in the country knows the chorus of the song by heart. The song was also popular in Colombia where it was known as “The Military” and brought to the contry by West African DJs.

The men in the group often dressed in military uniforms, wearing pith helmets and stuffing their clothes with pillows to appear like they had a swollen butts from riding the train and fat stomachs from eating too much. The song, music historians say, is a criticism of black military officers who were in league with whites to oppress their own people. Or at least, some of it was. The rest is Cameroonian slang and jargon from the soilders during the war.

Polythene Pam

"Polythene Pam" is a song written by John Lennon, credited to Lennon/McCartney, and performed by The Beatles on their album "Abbey Road".

The name 'Polythene Pam' came from the nickname of an early Beatles' fan from the Cavern Club days, named Pat Hodgett (now Dawson), who would often eat polythene. She became known as 'Polythene Pat'. She said in an interview, "I used to eat polythene all the time. I'd tie it in knots and then eat it. Sometimes I even used to burn it and then eat it when it got cold."

She Came in Through the Bathroom Window

"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window" is a song written by Paul McCartney (although credited to Lennon/McCartney) and performed by The Beatles on their album "Abbey Road" as part of the "Abbey Road" medley.

McCartney said the song was inspired by Apple scruffs (dedicated fans who would stay outside the Abbey Road studio and the homes of the Beatles), who broke into McCartney's St John's Wood home. Diane Ashley, one of the group, says: "We were bored, he was out and so we decided to pay him a visit. We found a ladder in his garden and stuck it up at the bathroom window which he'd left slightly open. I was the one who climbed up and got in." She then opened the front door to let the others in, and they stole a number of photographs. Another Apple scruff, Margo Bird, remembers being good friends with McCartney - she would often take his dog for walks - and later got a job at Apple Corps. She says that she was asked to get back a certain photograph, which she did.

In the 2006 DVD documentary "The Classic Artists Series: The Moody Blues" (DVD UK, released October 2006), Mike Pinder, the former keyboard player of Birmingham R&B band The Moody Blues, states that the inspiration for the song actually rests with an incident that happened to them—a groupie climbing into an open bathroom window in the band's home and spending the night with band member Ray Thomas. The next day, Pinder and Thomas told the story to McCartney, who—guitar in hand—strummed and sang "She came in through the bathroom window...".

The Beatles recorded the rhythm track for this and Polythene Pam as one piece on 25 July 1969. It took them 39 attempts, after which they added lead vocals and re-recorded the drums and bass guitar parts.

On July 28, they added more vocals, guitar, percussion and piano. The song was completed two days later with additional guitar and percussion.

This song was performed directly after "Polythene Pam", the song on the preceding track, without pause.

At the very beginning of the song, in anticipation to the change of meter, John Lennon says "we'll listen to that now... heh-heh" and then shouts "Oh, look out!" A slower, ethereal version of this song, recorded during the "Let It Be" sessions, appears on "Anthology 3".

<doc id="257115" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=257115" title="The End (The Beatles song)">
The End (The Beatles song)

"The End" is a song by The Beatles written by Paul McCartney (credited to Lennon/McCartney) for the album "Abbey Road". It was the last song recorded by all four of the Beatles, and is the final song of the medley that dominates side two of the LP version of the album. 

McCartney said, "I wanted [the medley] to end with a little meaningful couplet, so I followed the Bard [ Shakespeare ] and wrote a couplet." In his 1980 interview with "Playboy", John Lennon said, "That's Paul again ... He had a line in it, 'And in the end, the love you get is equal to the love you give,' which is a very cosmic, philosophical line. Which again proves that if he wants to, he can think." Lennon misquoted the line slightly; the actual words are, "And, in the end, the love you take/ Is equal to the love you make."

Recording began on July 23, 1969, when the Beatles recorded a one-minute, 20-second master recording that was extended via overdubs to two minutes and five seconds. At this point, the song was called "Ending." The first vocals for the song were added on August 5, more vocals and guitar overdubs were added on August 7, and bass and drums on August 8, the day the "Abbey Road" cover picture was taken. Orchestral overdubs were added August 15, and the closing piano and accompanying vocal on August 18.

All four Beatles have a solo in "The End", including a Ringo Starr drum solo. Starr did not like solos. McCartney, Harrison, and Lennon perform a rotating sequence of three, two-bar guitar solos. The solos begin 53 seconds into the song and end just before the final piano part. Lennon described it in his 1970 interview with "Rolling Stone": "There's a nice little bit I played on "Abbey Road". Paul gave us each a piece, a little break where Paul plays, George plays and I play." The first two bars are played by McCartney, the second two by Harrison, and the third two by Lennon, then the sequence repeats. Each has a style which McCartney felt reflected their personalities: McCartney's playing included string bends similar to his lead guitar work on "Another Girl" from the "Help!" album; Harrison's was melodic with slides yet technically advanced and Lennon's was rhythmic, stinging and had the heaviest distortion. Immediately after Lennon's third solo, the piano chords of the final line "And in the end..." begin. Then the orchestration arrangement takes over with a humming chorus and Harrison playing a final guitar solo that ends the song. 

Paul and John's last guitar solos and the drum solo were used in the intro to "Get Back" in the Beatles' Love.

"The End" was at first intended to be the final track on "Abbey Road", but it is followed by "Her Majesty". In the first practice mix, "Her Majesty" followed "Mean Mr. Mustard" (on the released version of the album, "Her Majesty" begins with the excised final chord of "Mean Mr. Mustard"). According to sound engineer John Kurlander, McCartney said, "I don't like 'Her Majesty,' throw it away." Kurlander cut it out, but said, "I'd been told never to throw anything away, so after he left I picked it up off the floor, put about 20 seconds of red leader tape before it, and stuck it onto the end of the edit tape." When McCartney heard "Her Majesty" in its new position he liked it and decided that it should remain on the album.

Richie Unterberger of Allmusic said that "The End" was to be "the group's take on the improvised jamming common to heavy rock of the late '60s, though as usual the Beatles did it with far more economic precision than anyone else." John Mendelsohn of "Rolling Stone" said it was "a perfect epitaph for our visit to the world of Beatle daydreams: "The love you take is equal to the love you make.".

History of ancient Israel and Judah

Israel and Judah were Iron Age kingdoms of the old Near East. The area of time covered in this page is from the first mention of the name Israel in the archaeological record (1200 BCE) to the end of a independent Judean kingdom near the time of Jesus Christ.

The two kingdoms arose on the most eastern coast of the Mediterranean, the most western part of the Fertile Crescent, between the old empires of Egypt to the south, Assyria, Babylonia, later Persia to the north and east, Greece and later Rome across the sea to the west. The area is small, maybe only 100 miles north to south and 40 or 50 miles east to west.

Israel and Judah were from the Canaanite culture of the late bronze age, and were based on villages that formed and grew in the southern Levant highlands (today for the region between the coastal plain and the Jordan Valley) between c.1200-1000 BCE. Israel became an important local power in the 9th and 8th centuries BCE before falling to the Assyrians; the southern kingdom, Judah, enjoyed a period of richness as a dependency of the greater empires of the region before a revolt against Babylon led to it being destoried early in the 6th century. Judean exiles returned from Babylon early in the following Persian period, starting the period in the starting of a Judahite presence in the province of Yehud, as Judah was now called. Yehud was absorbed into the subsequent Greek-ruled kingdoms which followed the conquests of Alexander the Great. In the 2nd century BCE, the Jews went up against Greek rule and created the Hasmonean kingdom, which became first a Roman dependency and soon went under direct Roman rule.

The eastern Mediterranean seaboard - the Levant - goes 400 miles north to south from the Taurus Mountains to the Sinai desert, and 70 to 100 miles east to west between the sea and the Arabian desert. The coastal area of the southern Levant, large in the south and becoming short to the north, the southernmost part has a zone of foothills, the Shephalah; like the plain this area narrows as it goes northwards, ending at Mount Carmel. East of the plain and the Shephalah is a mountainous ridge, the "hill country of Judah" in the south, the "hill country of Ephraim" north of that, then Galilee and the Lebanon mountains. To the east again lie the steep-sided valley occupied by the Jordan River, the Dead Sea, and the wadi of the Arabah, which continues down to the eastern arm of the Red Sea. Beyond the plateau is the Syrian desert, separating the Levant from Mesopotamia. To the southwest is Egypt, to the northeast Mesopotamia. "The Levant thus constitutes a narrow corridor whose geographical setting made it a constant area of contention between more powerful entities".

The central and northern part of the Levantine coast was known in Classical times as Phoenicia; the southernmost portion was known to the Egyptians as Canaan, by which they seem to have meant all their Asian possessions. In the bible Canaan can mean all of the land west of the Jordan river, or, more narrowly, the coastal strip. By Classical times the name Canaan had been dropped in favour of "Philistia", "Land of the Philistines", despite the fact that the Philistines had long since disappeared. The modern name "Palestine" is derived from this. Northeast of Canaan/Palestine was Aram, later called Syria after the Assyrians, who had likewise long since vanished.
Settlement during the Late Bronze was concentrated in the coastal plain and along major communication routes, with the central hill-country only sparsely inhabited; each city had its own ruler, constantly at odds with his neighbours and appealing to the Egyptians to adjudicate his differences. One of these Canaanite states was Jerusalem: letters from the Egyptian archives indicate that it followed the usual Late Bronze pattern of a small city with surrounding farmlands and villages; unlike most other Late Bronze city-states, there is no indication that it was destroyed at the end of the period.

Canaan in the 13th and early 12th centuries consisted of a diverse population of various origins, unified by a common socioeconomic system of city-states administered and controlled by Egypt. This stable system was broken at the end of the period by the collapse of Egyptian power and of the Canaanite city-state system. From the collapse two new communities emerged in the 12th century BCE, the Israelites in the hill country and the Philistines in the southern part of the coastal plain. The Philistines clearly represent the arrival of a considerable number of outsiders, probably from Cyprus, with their own non-indigenous culture. The Israelites are just as clearly indigenous to Canaan: to take linguistics as just one indicator, Judahite and Israelite Hebrew of the early 1st millennium BCE group with Phoenician, Ammonite, Moabite and Edomite; and within that grouping a "core Canaanite" of Israelite and Phoenician can be distinguished from a "fringe Canaanite" of Judahite, Ammonite, Moabite and Edomite. The causes of the Bronze Age collapse - which extended throughout the eastern Mediterranean - remain obscure, although drought, famine and other stresses may be behind the widespread population movements of the time; in any case, a number of important Canaanite cities were destroyed at the end of the Bronze Age (although the process was spread out over more than a century), and Canaanite culture was gradually absorbed into that of the Philistines, Phoenicians and Israelites.

The Merneptah stele, erected by an Egyptian pharaoh at the very beginning of Iron Age I, contains the first record of the name Israel: "Israel is laid waste and his seed is not." This Israel, identified as a people, were probably located in the northern part of the central highlands. As the Canaanite city-state system collapsed into chaos the previously unsettled highlands were starting to fill with villages: surveys have identified more than 300 small settlements, most of them new and the largest with a population of no more than 300, in the Palestinian highlands during Iron Age I. The process was most intensive, and villages larger, in the northern regions (biblical Manasseh and Ephraim), although no settlements can be described as urban. The total settled population at the beginning of the period was about 20,000, and double this number by the end. Nevertheless, while Iron Age I villages with features such as four-roomed houses, collar-rim store jars, and hewn water-cisterns are counted as Israelite when found in the highlands, it is in fact impossible to differentiate these from Canaanite sites of the same period; nor is it possible to distinguish between Hebrew and Canaanite inscriptions down to the 10th century. Throughout Iron Age I the highlands lack any sign of centralised authority, or of temples, shrines, or centralised worship in general (although cult-objects associated with the Canaanite god El have been found); almost the sole marker distinguishing the highland "Israelite" villages from Cannanite sites is an absence of pig bones, although whether this can be taken as an ethnic marker or is due to other factors remains a matter of dispute.

The same period saw the rise of the kingdoms of the kingdoms of Aram Damascus and Ammon to the east of the northern hill country, Moab (east of the Dead Sea), and Edom (in the Arabah south of the Dead Sea), in that order.

An inscription of the Egyptian pharaoh Shoshenq I, probably identical with the biblical Shishak, record a series of campaigns apparently directed at the area immediately north of Jerusalem in the second half of the 10th century BCE. About a hundred years later, in the 9th century BCE, the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III names Ahab of Israel among his enemies at the battle of Qarqar (853 BCE), while in the Mesha stele (c.830 BCE) a king of Moab celebrates his success in throwing off the oppression of the "House of Omri" (i.e. Israel). Similarly, the Tel Dan stele tells of the death of a king of Israel, probably Jehoram, at the hands of an Aramaen king about 841 BCE. Excavations at Samaria, the Israelite capital, further reinforce the impression of a powerful, centralised kingdom in the northern highlands during the 9th and 8th centuries. In the second half of the 8th century king Hoshea of Israel revolted against the Assyrians, and was crushed (c.722 BCE). Part of the population was deported, outside settlers were brought in to replace them, and Israel became an Assyrian province.

The first evidence for the existence of an organised kingdom in the southern region comes from the mid 9th century Tel Dan stele, which mentions the death of a king of the "House of David" alongside the king of Israel; the contemporary Mesha stele may also mention the House of David, although the reconstruction which allows this reading is disputed. It is generally assumed that this "House of David" is identical with the biblical dynasty, but the archaeological evidence from surface surveys indicates that during the 10th and 9th centuries Jerusalem was only one of the four large villages in the area, with no sign of primacy over its neighbours. It was only in the last part of the 8th century that Jerusalem experienced a period of rapid growth, achieving a population far greater than at any time before and clear primacy over the surrounding towns. The older scholarly reconstruction of events is that this was due to an influx of refugees from Israel following its conquest by the Assyrians (c.722 BC), but the newer view is that it reflects a cooperative effort between Assyria and the kings of Jerusalem to establish Judah as a pro-Assyrian vassal state exercising control over the valuable olive industry. The sudden collapse of the Assyrian power in the last half of the 7th century led to an unsuccessful bid for independence under king Josiah, followed by the destruction of Jerusalem by Assyria's successor, the neo-Babylonian empire (587/586 BCE).

In 586 BCE, the Babylonians, under king Nebuchadnezzar II captured Jerusalem, destroyed the Temple of Solomon, ended the Davidic kingship, and carried the people into captivity. Only the poorest were left behind in Judah, now the Babylonian province of Yehud with its capital at Mizpah in the former territory of Benjamin, north of Jerusalem. A few years later, again according to the bible, the governor of Yehud was murdered by rivals, triggering another exodus of refugees, this time to Egypt. Thus by about 580 the people of Judah were to be found in three separate locations, the elite in Babylon (where, incidentally, they appear to have been well treated), a large community in Egypt, and a remnant in Judah. The Exile ended when Cyrus the Great of Persia conquered Babylon (traditionally 538 BCE). The Persians reconstituted Judah/Yehud as a province ("Yehud medinata") within the satrapy "Beyond the River", and over the following century some of the exiles returned to Jerusalem. There they eventually rebuilt the Temple (traditionally 516/515 BCE), but for over a century the administrative capital remained at Mizpah. Samaria, meanwhile, continued as the province of Semarina within the same satrapy as Yehud.

In 539 BCE the Persians conquered Babylon and in 537 BCE, inaugurated the Persian period of Jewish history. In 520 BCE Cyrus the Great allowed Jews to return to Judea and rebuild the Temple (completed 515 BCE). He appointed Zerubbabel (the grandson of the second to last Judean king, Jehoiachin) governor, but did not allow the restoration of the kingdom. The influence of Zoroastrianism on monotheism, Judaism, as well as Christianity are still the subject of academic debate.

Without the constraining power of the monarchy, the authority of the Temple was amplified, and priests became the dominant authority. However, the Second Temple had been constructed under the auspices of a foreign power, and there were lingering questions about its legitimacy. This provided the condition for various sects to develop within Judaism over the coming centuries, each of which claimed to represent "Judaism". Most of these typically discouraged social intercourse, especially marriage, with members of other sects. 

The end of the Babylonian Exile saw not only the construction of the Second Temple, but, according to the Documentary Hypothesis, the final redaction of the Torah as well. Although the priests controlled the monarchy and the Temple, scribes and sages (who later became the "rabbis") monopolized the study of the Torah, which (starting from the time of Ezra) was read publicly on market-days. These sages developed and maintained an oral tradition alongside of the Holy Writ, and identified with the prophets. According to Geza Vermes, such scribes were often addressed using a basic term of respect, "lord."

The Hellenistic period of Jewish history began in 332 BCE when Alexander the Great conquered Persia. Upon his death in 323 BCE, his empire was divided among his generals. At first, Judea was ruled by the Egyptian-Hellenic Ptolemies, but in 198 BCE,the Syrian-Hellenic Seleucid Empire, under Antiochus III, seized control over Judea. 

The Hellenistic Period saw the canonization of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), according to one theory, see Development of the Jewish canon for details, and the emergence of extra-Biblical sacred traditions. The earliest evidence of a Jewish mysticism tradition surrounds the book of Ezekiel, written during the Babylonian Exile. Virtually all known mystical texts, however, were written at the end of the Second Temple period. Scholars like Gershom Scholom have discerned within the esoteric traditions of the Kabbalah(Jewish Mysticism, which were restricted to sages), the influence of Persian beliefs, Platonic philosophy and Gnosticism. 

2 Esdras 14:45-46, which was written in the second century CE, declares: "Make public the twenty-four books that you wrote first, and let the worthy and the unworthy read them; but keep the seventy that were written last, in order to give them to the wise among your people." This is the first known reference to the canonized Hebrew Bible, and the seventy non-canonical texts may have been mystical; the Talmud suggests other mystical traditions which may have their roots in Second Temple Judaism.

The Near East was cosmopolitan, especially during the Hellenistic period. Several languages were used, and the matter of the "lingua franca" is still subject of some debate. The Jews almost certainly spoke Aramaic among themselves. Greek was at least to some extent a trade language in the region, and indeed throughout the entire eastern portion of the Mediterranean. Judaism was rapidly changing, reacting and adapting to a larger political, cultural, and intellectual world, and in turn drawing the interests of non-Jews.
Historian Shaye Cohen observed:

Many Jews lived in the Diaspora, and the Judean provinces of Judea, Samaria, and the Galilee were populated by many Gentiles (who often showed an interest in Judaism). Jews had to live with the values of Hellenism and Hellenistic philosophy, which were often directly at odds with their own values and traditions. Broadly, Hellenistic culture saw itself as a civilizor, bringing civilized values and ways to peoples they thought of as insular or either backwards or degenerate. 

For example, Greek-style bath houses were built in sight of the Temple in Jerusalem, for instance, and even in that city the "gymnasium" became a center of social, athletic, and intellectual life. Many Jews, including some of the more aristocratic priests, embraced these institutions, although Jews who did so were often looked down upon due to their circumcision, which Jews saw as the mark of their covenant with God, but which Hellenistic culture viewed as an aesthetic defacement of the body. Consequently, some Jews began to abandon the practice of circumcision (and thus their covenant with God), while others bridled at Greek domination.

At the same time that Jews were confronting the cultural differences at their door, they had to confront a paradox in their own tradition: their Torah laws applied only to them, and to proselytes, but their God, they believed, was the one and only God of all. This situation led to new interpretations of the Torah, some of which were influenced by Hellenic thought and in response to Gentile interest in Judaism. It was in this period that many concepts from early Greek philosophy entered or influenced Judaism, as well as debates and sects within the religion and culture of the time.

In 331 BCE Alexander the Great took over the Persian Empire. Upon his death in 323 BCE his empire crumbled, and the province of Yehud became part of the kingdom of Egypt, ruled by the Ptolemaic dynasty. Ptolemaic rule was mild: Alexandria became the largest Jewish city in the world, and Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt (281-246 BCE) promoted Jewish culture, sponsoring the Septuagint translation of the Torah. This period also saw the beginning of the Pharisees and other Jewish Second Temple parties such as the Sadducees and Essenes.. But in the early 2nd century BCE Yehud fell to the Seleucid Syrian ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes (174-163 BCE), who, in contrast to the tolerance shown by the Ptolemids, attempted complete Hellenization of the Jews. His desecration of the Temple sparked a national rebellion, which ended in the expulsion of the Syrians and the re-consecration of the Temple under the Maccabees

The kingdom established by the Maccabees was a conscious attempt to revive the Judah described in the bible: a Jewish monarchy ruled from Jerusalem and stretching over all the territories once ruled by David and Solomon. In order to carry out this project the Hasmonean kings conquered (and forcibly converted to Judaism) the one-time Moabites, Edomites and Ammonites, as well as the lost kingdom of Israel.

Generally, the Jews accepted foreign rule when they were only required to pay tribute, and otherwise allowed to govern themselves internally. Nevertheless, Jews were divided between those favoring hellenization and those opposing it, and were divided over allegiance to the Ptolemies or Seleucids. When the High Priest Simon II died in 175 BCE, conflict broke out between supporters of his son Onias III (who opposed hellenization, and favored the Ptolemies) and his son Jason (who favored hellenization, and favored the Seleucids). A period of political intrigue followed, with priests such as Menelaus bribing the king to win the High Priesthood, and accusations of murder of competing contenders for the title. The result was a brief civil war. 

Huge numbers of Jews flocked to Jason's side, and in 167 BCE the Seleucid king Antiochus IV invaded Judea, entered the Temple, and stripped it of money and ceremonial objects. Jason fled to Egypt, and Antiochus imposed a program of forced hellenization, requiring Jews to abandon their own laws and customs under threat of slaughter. At this point Mattathias and his five sons, John, Eleazar, Simon, Jonathan, and Judah Maccabee, priests of the Hasmon family living in the rural village of Modein (pronounced "Mo-Ah-Dein"), assumed leadership of a bloody and ultimately successful revolt against the Seleucids.

Judah liberated Jerusalem in 165 BCE and restored the Temple. Fighting continued, and Judah and his brother Jonathan were killed. In 141 BCE an assembly of priests and others affirmed Simon as high priest and leader, in effect establishing the Hasmonean dynasty. When Simon was killed in 135 BCE, his son (and Judah's nephew) John Hyrcanus took his place as high priest and king.

After defeating the Seleucid forces, John Hyrcanus established a new monarchy in the form of the priestly Hasmonean dynasty in 152 BCE — thus making priests as political as well as religious authorities. Although the Hasmoneans were popularly seen as heroes and leaders for resisting the Seleucids, some regarded their reign as lacking the religious legitimacy conferred by descent from the Davidic dynasty of the First Temple Era.

The rift between the priests and the sages grew during the Hellenistic period, when the Jews faced new political and cultural struggles. Around this time the Sadducee party emerged as the party of the priests and allied elites (the name "Sadducee" comes from Zadok, the high priest of the first Temple). 

The Essenes were another early mystical-religious movement, who are believed to have rejected either the Seleucid appointed high priests, or the Hasmonean high priests, as wrong. But they soon rejected the Second Temple, arguing that the Essene community was itself the new Temple, and that obedience to the law represented a new form of sacrifice. 

Although their lack of concern for the Second Temple alienated the Essenes from the great mass of Jews, their notion that the sacred could exist outside of the Temple was shared by another group, the Pharisees ("separatists"), based within the community of scribes and sages. The meaning of the name is unclear, though.

During the Hasmonean period, the Sadducees and Pharisees functioned primarily as political parties (the Essenes not being as politically oriented). The political differences between the Sadducees and Pharisees became evident when Pharisees demanded that the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannai choose between being king and being High Priest in the traditional manner. This demand led to a brief civil war that ended with a bloody repression of the Pharisees, although at his deathbed the king called for a reconciliation between the two parties. Alexander was succeeded by his widow, whose brother was a leading Pharisee. Upon her death her elder son, Hyrcanus II, sought Pharisee support, and her younger son, Aristobulus, sought the support of the Sadducees.

In 64 BCE the Roman general Pompey took over Jerusalem and made the Jewish kingdom a client of Rome. In 57-55 BCE Aulus Gabinius, proconsul of Syria, split it into Galilee, Samaria & Judea, with 5 district Sanhedrin/Synedrion (councils of law). In 40-39 BCE Herod the Great was appointed King of the Jews by the Roman Senate, but in 6 CE his successor, Herod Archelaus, ethnarch of Judea, was deposed by the emperor Augustus and his territories annexed as Iudaea Province under direct Roman administration: this marked the end of Judah as an even theoretically independent kingdom.

Israel and Judah inherited the religion of late first-millennium Canaan, and Canaanite religion in turn had its roots in the religion of second-millennium Ugarit. In the 2nd millennium, polytheism was expressed through the concepts of the divine council and the divine family.

Golden Slumbers

"Golden Slumbers" is a song by The Beatles, part of the climactic medley on their 1969 album "Abbey Road". The song begins the progression that leads to the end of the album and is followed by "Carry That Weight." The two songs were recorded together as a single piece, and both were written by Paul McCartney (credited to Lennon/McCartney).

McCartney was the lead vocalist. He begins the song in a soft tone, with piano, bass guitar, and string section accompaniment. Starting with the line "Golden slumbers fill your eyes", the drums come in and McCartney switches to a stronger tone. McCartney said, "I remember trying to get a very strong vocal on it, because it was such a gentle theme, so I worked on the strength of the vocal on it, and ended up quite pleased with it."

The main recording session for "Golden Slumbers"/"Carry That Weight" was on July 2, 1969.
John Lennon was not present. He was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Scotland on July 1, 1969, and was hospitalized there until July 6.

Additional vocals were added in an overdub session on 30 July 1969, the same day the first trial edit of the side two medley was created. Lennon did participate in this session. On 15 August, orchestral overdubs were made to "Golden Slumbers" and five other songs on "Abbey Road".

Carry That Weight

"Carry That Weight" is a song by The Beatles. Released on "Abbey Road" and part of the long, climactic medley that closes the album, it has vocals from all four of the Beatles (a rarity in their songs). It is after "Golden Slumbers", and transitions into "The End".

The middle bridge, featuring brass instruments, electric guitar and vocals, repeats the beginning of "You Never Give Me Your Money", but with different lyrics. The ending also repeats the arpeggiated guitar motif from the end of that song, similar to the figure featured in the George Harrison written songs "Here Comes the Sun" and "Badge" (co-written by Harrison and Eric Clapton).

Music critic Ian MacDonald said that the lyrics was an acknowledgment by the group that nothing they would do as solo artists would equal what they had achieved together, and they would always carry the weight of their Beatle past. McCartney said the song was about the Beatles' business difficulties and the atmosphere at Apple at the time. In the film "", Lennon says that McCartney was "singing about all of us."

The Beatles began recording "Golden Slumbers"/"Carry That Weight" as one piece on July 2, 1969. McCartney, Harrison and Starr recorded 15 takes of the two songs while Lennon was in the hospital recovering from a car accident in Scotland.

The rhythm tracks featured McCartney on piano, Harrison on bass guitar and Starr on drums. The best were takes 13 and 15, which were edited together on July 3rd. That day and the next, McCartney overdubbed his lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Harrison added lead guitar, and all three sang the chorus.

On July 30, they added more vocals, including Lennon, who had rejoined the sessions on July 9. More vocals, timpani and drums were overdubbed on 31 July. The orchestra was recorded on August 15.

Her Majesty (song)

"Her Majesty" is a song written by Paul McCartney (although credited to Lennon/McCartney) that appears on The Beatles' album "Abbey Road". "Her Majesty" is the final track of the album and appears fourteen seconds after the song "The End", but was not listed on the original sleeve. As such, it is considered one of the first examples of a hidden track in rock music.

The song was recorded in three takes on July 2, 1969, before the Beatles started work on "Golden Slumbers"/"Carry That Weight". McCartney sang and played an acoustic guitar. The decision take it from the Abbey Road medley was made on July 30.

Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)

"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" is a song credited to Lennon/McCartney, and released in 1967, on The Beatles' album of the same name. The song appears twice on the album: as the first song (transitioning into "With a Little Help from My Friends"), and as "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)", (which transitions into "A Day in the Life"). As the title track, the lyrics introduce the fictional band that performs in the album.

Since its original album release, the song has also been released on singles, on compilation albums, and has been performed by several other artists including Jimi Hendrix, U2, and a comic interpretation by Bill Cosby.

On the "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" album, the song opens to the sound of a loud audience, and an orchestra tuning up, which was taken from the February 10 orchestra session for "A Day in the Life". The crowd sounds edited into the song were recorded in the early '60s by Martin, during a live recording of the stage show Beyond the Fringe. When the song itself begins, the band introduces its members. The song is in G major, with a 4/4 meter. A horn quartet was used to fill out the instrumental sections.

"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)" is a repeat of the song at a faster tempo with heavier instruments. While the first track stays largely in the key of G major (except for transient modulation to F and perhaps C in the bridges), the reprise starts in F and modulates back to G. The track opens with a distorted guitar strumming a "Hendrix chord" (dominant 7th sharp 9). McCartney counts 1-2-3-4, and between 2 and 3, Lennon says "bye!".

The idea for a reprise was Aspinall's, who thought that as there was a "welcome song", there should be a "goodbye song". The song contains the same melody as the opening version, but with different lyrics. At 1:18, it is one of the Beatles' shorter songs (the shortest is "Her Majesty" at 0:23). The reprise was recorded on 1 April 1967, two months after the version that opens the album. At the end of the track, Martin's pre-recorded applause sample segues into the real final track of the album, "A Day in the Life".

With a Little Help from My Friends

"With a Little Help from My Friends" (originally titled "A Little Help from My Friends") is a song written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, released on The Beatles album "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" in 1967. The song was written for and sung by Beatles drummer Ringo Starr as the character "Billy Shears"; it is ranked #304 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr performed this song for the first time together at the David Lynch Foundation Benefit Concert in the Radio City Music Hall, New York on 4 April 2009.

Lennon and McCartney finished writing this song in mid-March 1967, written as Starr's song for the album. It was briefly called "Bad Finger Boogie" (later the inspiration for the band name Badfinger), because Lennon composed the melody on a piano using his middle finger after having hurt his forefinger; but in his 1980 "Playboy" interview Lennon said: "This is Paul, with a little help from me. 'What do you see when you turn out the light/ I can't tell you, but I know it's mine...' is mine."

Lennon and McCartney wrote a tune with a limited range - except for the last note, which McCartney worked closely with Starr to achieve. 
Speaking in the Anthology, Starr insisted on changing the first line which originally was ""What would you do if I sang out of tune? Would you stand up and throw tomatoes at me?"" He changed the lyric so that fans would not throw tomatoes at him should he perform it live. (In the early days, after George Harrison made a comment that he liked jelly babies, fans would throw them at the Beatles at all of their live shows.)

The song is in the form of a conversation. The other three Beatles sing a question and Starr answers, for example: "Would you believe in a love at first sight? / Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time."

The band started recording the song the day before they posed for the Sgt. Pepper album cover (29 March 1967), ending the session at 5:45 in the morning.


"With a Little Help from My Friends" was played as wake-up music on Space Shuttle Mission STS-61.

Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" is a song written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney for the Beatles' 1967 album "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band".

Lennon's son, Julian, inspired the song with a nursery school drawing he called "Lucy — in the sky with diamonds". Shortly after the song's release, people realized that the first letter of each of the title's nouns spelled LSD. Though Lennon denied and mocked the idea of a hidden LSD reference, the BBC banned the song. 

According to the Beatles, Lennon's son, Julian Lennon showed his father a nursery school drawing he called Lucy - in the sky with diamonds, depicting his classmate, Lucy O'Donnell. 
Julian said, "I don't know why I called it that or why it stood out from all my other drawings, but I obviously had an affection for Lucy at that age. I used to show dad everything I'd built or painted at school, and this one sparked off the idea..." Lucy Vodden née O'Donnell died of an immune system disease in 2009.

Lennon was surprised at the idea that the song title was a hidden reference to LSD.

"Rolling Stone" magazine described the song as "Lennon's lavish daydream" and music critic Richie Unterberger said "'Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds' was one of the best songs on the Beatles' famous Sgt. Pepper album, and one of the classic songs of psychedelia as a whole. There are few other songs that so successfully evoke a dream world, in both the sonic textures and words." In a review for the BBC, Chris Jones described the song as "nursery rhyme surrealism" that contributed to Sgt. Pepper's "revolutionary ... sonic carpet that enveloped the ears and sent the listener spinning into other realms."

In later interviews, Lennon expressed disappointment with the Beatles' arrangement of the recording, complaining that inadequate time was taken to fully develop his initial idea for the song. He also said that he felt he didn't think that he sang it very well. "I was so nervous I couldn't sing," he told the journalist Ray Connolly, "but I like the lyrics."

A 3.2 million year-old, 40% complete fossil skeleton of an "Australopithecus afarensis" specimen discovered in 1974 was named "Lucy" because the Beatles song was being played loudly and repeatedly on a tape recorder in the camp.

The White dwarf star BPM 37093, which contains a core of crystallized carbon roughly 4000 km in diameter, is informally named "Lucy" as a tribute to the Beatles song.

Getting Better

"Getting Better" is a song written by Paul McCartney and John Lennon, based on an original idea by McCartney. It was recorded by The Beatles for the 1967 album "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band".

One of the recording sessions for "Getting Better" is famous for an incident involving Lennon. During the 21 March 1967 session in which producer George Martin added a piano solo, Lennon complained that he did not feel well and could not focus. He had accidentally taken LSD when he meant to take an upper. Unaware of the mistake, Martin took him up to the roof of Abbey Road Studio for some fresh air, and returned to Studio Two where McCartney and Harrison were waiting. They knew why Lennon was not well, and upon hearing where Lennon was, rushed to the roof to retrieve him and prevent a possible accident.

Fixing a Hole

"Fixing a Hole" is a song mainly written by Paul McCartney (credited to Lennon/McCartney) and performed by The Beatles on the 1967 album "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band".
The first of two recording sessions for the song was at Regent Sound Studio in London on 9 February 1967 in three takes.

The lead vocal was recorded at the same time as the rhythm track, a change from their post-1963 approach of overdubbing the vocal.

According to McCartney, on the night of the session an unusual man appeared at the gate of McCartney's home and said he was Jesus Christ. After a cup of tea, and after getting him to promise to be quiet and sit in a corner, McCartney brought the man to the recording session. After the session the man left and was never heard from again.

In another version of the story, John Lennon arrived at the studio, found the man hanging around the front door, and it was Lennon who invited him in.

The song is referenced to by Lennon in the last stanza of the song "Glass Onion" ("Fixing a Hole in the ocean"), from "The Beatles", released a year later.

In the live-action scene at the end of the 1968 film "Yellow Submarine", Ringo mentions that he gave the other half of the "hole in me pocket" to Jeremy, so that he could "stop his mind from wandering", a direct reference to "Fixing a Hole".

She's Leaving Home

"She's Leaving Home" is a song, written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney and released in 1967 on The Beatles album "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band". McCartney wrote and sang the verse and Lennon the chorus. This was one of a handful of songs of the Beatles in which the members did not play any instruments. 

Paul McCartney:
The newspaper story McCartney mentioned was from the front page of the "Daily Mirror", about a girl named Melanie Coe. Although McCartney made up most of the content, Coe, who was 17 at the time said that he got most of it right. Her parents wondered why she had left... "She has everything here." In real life, Melanie did not "meet a man from the motor trade", but instead a croupier, and left in the afternoon while her parents were at work. She was found ten days later because she had said where her boyfriend worked.

Coincidentally, Coe had met McCartney three years earlier when she was a contestant and prize winner on ITV's "Ready Steady Go!". An update on Melanie appeared in the Daily Mail in May 2008.

The day before McCartney wanted to work on the string arrangement, he learned that George Martin was not available to do the score. He contacted Mike Leander, who did it in Martin's place. It was the first time a Beatle song was not arranged by Martin (and the only time it was done with the Beatles' consent: Phil Spector's orchestration of "Let It Be" was done without McCartney's knowledge). Martin was hurt by McCartney's actions, but he produced the song and conducted the string section. The harp was played by Sheila Bromberg, the first female musician to appear on a Beatles record.

The stereo version of the song runs at a slower speed than the mono mix, and consequently is a semitone lower in pitch. This is mentioned in the booklet accompanying "The Beatles in Mono" CD box set, but no reason is given. A 2007 Mojo magazine article revealed the mono mix was sped up to make Paul sound younger and tighten the track.

When discussing Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, composer Ned Rorem described "She's Leaving Home" as "equal to any song that Schubert ever wrote."

Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!

"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" is a song from the 1967 album by The Beatles, "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band". It was composed mainly by John Lennon with input from Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon/McCartney.

Lennon wrote the song taking inspiration from a nineteenth century circus poster for Pablo Fanque's circus which he purchased in an antique shop on 31 January 1967 while filming the promotional video for the song "Strawberry Fields Forever" in Kent. Lennon said that "Everything from the song is from that poster, except the horse wasn't called Henry." (The poster idenitifies the horse as "Zanthus".) Mr. Kite is believed to be William Kite, who worked for Pablo Fanque from 1843 to 1845.

Within You Without You

"Within You Without You" is a song written by George Harrison and released on The Beatles' 1967 album, "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band". 

"Within You Without You" features only Harrison and a group of uncredited Indian musicians, although producer George Martin arranged the string section, and Harrison and assistant Neil Aspinall played the tambura. According to Prema Music, dilrubha player Amrit Gajjar played on the track. It is the second of Harrison's songs to be explicitly influenced by Indian classical music, after "Love You To", and Harrison's only composition on "Sgt. Pepper". "Within You Without You" was written on a harmonium at the house of long-time Beatles friend Klaus Voormann, while "there were lots of joints being smoked".

Stephen Stills was so impressed by the lyrics that he had them carved on a stone monument in his yard. John Lennon said it was"one of George's best songs."

Book of Wisdom

The Book of Wisdom (also called Wisdom of Solomon or just Wisdom) is one of the books of the Old Testament. It has been grouped among the Septuagint, or the seven wisdom books of the Bible.

A priest named St. Melito, who lived in the second century AD, said that the book was considered canonical by Jews and Christians, and that Naḥmanides was able to translate the book into Hebrew when he wrote the Pentateuch.

The book was initially written in the Greek language, but had the style of Hebrew poetry. No one really knows who wrote the book, but some archeologists think that it was most likely King Solomon who had written it. This is based on some of the style and language of the book. For example, "Thou hast chosen me to be a king of thy people, and a judge of thy sons and daughters: Thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount..." The style here looks a lot like another book of the Septuagint, called the Ecclesiastes, "I, Koheleth, was king in Jerusalem over Israel," which also leaves out Solomon's name, but implies through the style. Some Christians at the time knew that King Solomon wasn't the author of the book, as told by the Muratorian fragment that the book was "written by the friends of Solomon in his honor." That is why other people do not believe King Solomon was the true author. A Catholic Encyclopedia also had said: "at the present day, it is freely admitted that Solomon is not the writer of the Book of Wisdom, which has been ascribed to him because its author, through a literary fiction, speaks as if he were the Son of David." Even though the book was called the Wisdom of Solomon, it was probably finished long after he died.

The book has the most classical Greek language of all the books in the Septuagint. It also had much of the Hebrew style that had existed when the book was written. The writer also must have been deeply involved in the philosophical, religious, and ethical writings in Hellenistic Alexandria.

Cooktown, Queensland

Cooktown is the northernmost town on the east coast of Australia. In 2006, there were 2093 people living in the town. It is at the mouth of the Endeavour River, on Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland. Cooktown is named after the English explorer, Captain James Cook, and the Endeavour River is named after his ship, the "Endeavour".

Its population of 2000 doubles each June as the community re-enact Cook’s historic landing, complete with replica ship, cannon fire and period costume.

<doc id="257231" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=257231" title="Endeavour River">
Endeavour River

The Endeavour River on Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland, Australia, was named in 1770 by the English explorer, Captain James Cook. He had been forced to put his ship, HM Bark Endeavour, onto the beach at the river mouth so that it could be repaired. The ship had been damaged by coral on the Great Barrier Reef. The Aboriginal Australians, the Guugu Yimithirr people, called the river "Wabalumbaal". 

Cook and his crew stayed for seven weeks and met with the Guugu Yimithirr. The word "kangaroo" was a Guugu Yimithirr word for the animal which Cook wrote down in his diary. The naturalists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander made big collections of native plants and flowers, while Sydney Parkinson made pictures of the flora and fauna of the region. 

The Endeavour River is very wide at its mouth where it meets the sea. Upstream it quickly branches into many small creeks. There are 25 species of mangrove grwoing along the river. Saltwater crocodiles live in the river, and can often be seen on the banks during the winter in June and July. In October 2008, a man fishing for crabs on the river bank was taken by a crocodile. At first people thought it was a big crocodile, more than six metres in length. But his remains were later found inside a 4.5 metre crocodile. The river is also a good place to go fishing for barramundi. 

In recent years, tilapia fish, which are a "noxious species" in Australia, have moved into the river in large numbers. Scientists are worried that this will harm the numbers of native fish. These fish, which are often farmed for food in other countries, are listed in the worst 100 introduced species. A person in Australia owning or selling a tilapia could be fined up to AU$11,000.

There is now a town, Cooktown, at the mouth of the Endeavour River. About 2000 people live in the town. Cooktown is the northernmost town on the east coast of Australia. It was first settled in 1873, at the site of Cook's landing. It was a port for the newly discovered Palmer River Goldfields. Some of the relatively undisturbed natural features near the mouth of the river have been protected as a Queensland National Park, the Endeavour River National Park.

Liv Ullmann

Liv Ullmann (born 16 December 1938) is a Norwegian actress particularly associated with films by Swedish director Ingmar Bergman. 

Born in Tokyo, Japan, to Norwegian parents. Her father was an engineer and after his death in 1946, Ullmann returned to Norway with her mother and older sister, where they settled in Trondheim. 

After high school, she decided on an acting career. She applied and was turned down twice at the National Theater School in Oslo. She nonetheless persevered and after some studies at the Webber School of Acting in London, she eventually found work with a repertory theatre company in Stavenger. She also began appearing in bit parts in films and on television. 

She got her first major break when she met Swedish director Ingmar Bergman who offered her a role in his film "Persona" (1966), opposite Bibi Anderson. She became his muse and lover and went on starring in several of his films to considerable acclaim; "Hour of the Wolf" (1968), "Shame" (1968), "The Passion of Anna" (1969), "Cries and Whispers" (1972), "Scenes of a Marriage" (1973), "Face to Face" (1975), "The Serpent's Egg" (1977), "Autumn Sonata" (1978) and "Saraband" (2003).

She also appeared in Jan Troell's epic film "The Emigrants" (1971) and its sequel "The New Land" (1972), which earned her an Academy Award nomination as best actress. 

After her break up with Bergman in the early 1970s, she went to Hollywood and appeared in films such as "Pope Joan" (1972), "New Horizons" (1973), "Forty Carats" (1973), "The Abdication" (1974), "Zandy's Bride" (1974), but failed to establish herself as the new Nordic star like Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman before her.

She published two autobiographies "Changing" (1977) and "Choices" (1984), in which she candidly discussed her life and career. 

In the 1990s, she turned to directing with films like "Sofie" (1992) and "Kristin Lavransdotter" (1995). She also worked as a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF. 

Miss Ullmann has a daughter Linn Ullmann (born in 1966) with Ingmar Bergman, and two grandchildren.

Bel and the Dragon

The tale of Bel and the Dragon is from chapter 14 of the Book of Daniel. This chapter, along with chapter 13, is referred to as deuterocanonical, in that it is not universally accepted among Christians as belonging to the Bible. The story is typically not included in Protestant Bibles.

It is believed by some scholars to have been written in the late 2nd century BC and accounted apocryphal by Protestants. The chapter is formed of three independent narratives, which place the culture-hero Daniel at the court of Cyrus, king of the Persians: "When King Astyages was laid to rest with his ancestors, Cyrus the Persian succeeded to his kingdom." There Daniel "was a companion of the king, and was the most honored of all his Friends" (14:1).

The narrative of Bel (14:1–22) is a folk tale ridiculing worship. In it, the king asks Daniel "Do you not think that Bel is a living god? Do you not see how much he eats and drinks every day?" Daniel proves through a ruse that the sacred meal of Bel is actually consumed at night by the seventy priests and their wives and children, who entered through a secret door when the temple's doors were sealed. The priests and their wives and children are killed, and Daniel is permitted to destroy the idol of Bel and the temple. This version has been cited as an ancestor of the "locked room mystery". 

In the brief companion narrative of the Dragon (14:23–30), "there was a great dragon, which the Babylonians revered." In this case the supposed god is no idol, but not all that eats is divine: Daniel slew the dragon by making cakes of pitch, fat and hair. The dragon ate them and burst open. Now the Babylonians were indignant. "The king has become a Jew; he has destroyed Bel, and killed the dragon, and slaughtered the priests," they said, and demanded that Daniel be handed over to them.

The third narrative (14:31–42), Daniel in the Lions' Den, is apparently Daniel's 1st or 2nd trip. It has been made into a consequence of the preceding episode, but the Septuagint precedes it with the notice: "From the prophecy of Habakkuk, son of Jesus, of the tribe of Levi." Daniel remained unharmed in the den with seven lions, fed by the miraculous transportation of the prophet Habakkuk. "On the seventh day the king came to mourn for Daniel. When he came to the den he looked in, and there sat Daniel! The king shouted with a loud voice, "You are great, O Lord, the God of Daniel, and there is no other besides you!" Then he pulled Daniel out, and threw into the den those who had attempted his destruction, and they were instantly eaten before his eyes." Some have suggested that the Daniel in Bel and the Dragon is different from that of Daniel 1-13.

When I'm Sixty-Four

"When I'm Sixty-Four" is a love song by The Beatles, written by Paul McCartney (credited to Lennon/McCartney) and released in 1967 on their album "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band".

According to Ian MacDonald, the song was "aimed chiefly at parents, and as a result got a cool reception from the group's own generation."

The song is sung by a young man to his lover, and is about his plans of growing old together with her. Although the theme is aging, it was one of the first songs McCartney wrote, when he was sixteen. The Beatles used it in the early days as a song they could play when the amplifiers broke down or the electricity went off. Both George Martin and Mark Lewisohn thought that McCartney may have thought of the song when recording began for "Sgt. Pepper" in December 1966 because his father turned 64 earlier that year.

Lennon said of the song, "Paul wrote it in the Cavern days. We just stuck a few more words on it like 'grandchildren on your knee' and 'Vera, Chuck and Dave' ... this was just one that was quite a hit with us." In his 1980 interview for "Playboy" he said, "I would never even dream of writing a song like that."

The song was recorded on 6 December 1966, during one of the first sessions for the as-yet-unnamed album that became "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band". There were multiple overdub sessions, including the lead vocal by McCartney on 8 December and backing vocals by McCartney, Lennon, and George Harrison on 20 December. The clarinets were recorded on 21 December.

The song is in the key of D-flat major. The Beatles recorded the song in C major but the master take was sped up in order to raise the key by one semitone at the insistence of McCartney. Martin remembers that McCartney suggested this change in order to make his voice sound younger. McCartney says, "I wanted to appear younger, but that was just to make it more rooty-tooty; just lift the key because it was starting to sound turgid."

The song was nearly released on a single as the B-side with either "Strawberry Fields Forever" or "Penny Lane" as the A-side. Instead, Martin decided on a double-A-sided-disc. The single did not make #1 in the UK, breaking a string of #1 singles going back to 1963. If "When I'm Sixty-Four" had been issued as a B-side, it probably would not have appeared on "Sgt. Pepper".

Hispania Racing

Hispania Racing F1 Team, officially known as HRT F1 Team, is a Spanish Formula One team. It was founded by former driver Adrián Campos, and first known as Campos Meta 1. The team was taken over by José Ramón Carabante and renamed HRT. The team made its debut in the season. It is the first Spanish team to race in Formula One. A previous Spanish effort known as Bravo F1 tried but failed to enter the sport in .

The team began as a collaboration between Adrián Campos of Campos Racing and Enrique Rodríguez of Meta Image, under the name of Campos Meta. Campos Racing currently runs a team in the European F3 Open Championship. They also used to run the GP2 Series team now known as Addax Team. Campos was running the Formula One operation in conjunction with Meta Image. Meta Image is a Madrid-based sports agency, who managed one of Campos' F3 Open drivers, Bruno Méndez. Campos and Rodríguez began looking at the possibility of creating Spain's first Formula One team in February 2009. In March, the team gained shareholders (investors) such as Spanish businessman José Ramón Carabante and basketball players Pau Gasol and Jorge Garbajosa.

The team's headquarters were first located at Meta Images's offices in Madrid, housing marketing and administration. Its technical centre is located at Campos Racing's headquarters in Alzira, Valencia. In October 2009 the team completed a deal with the local government of the Region of Murcia to build new facilities for the team at the Parque Tecnológico Fuente Álamo de Murcia science park. Italian constructor Dallara built the 2010 cars in Parma, which used Cosworth engines.

On June 12, Campos Meta were named by the FIA as one of three new teams granted entry to the 2010 season..

On the weekend of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Campos confirmed that Bruno Senna, the nephew of former world champion Ayrton Senna, would be one of their racing drivers for 2010.

In January 2010, A1 Grand Prix principal Tony Teixeira was one of several potential investors linked to the team. The investors were an effort to open up revenue for the 2010 pre-season testing. On January 27, the team admitted that they may not be able to participate in the 2010 pre-season testing, and that their second driver may not be announced until the eve of their first race. Teixeira said the team was aiming to make the second test session and believed that they would "definitely" make the third session at Jerez.

On 5 February 2010, Campos boss Adrián Campos told BBC Sport that the team were struggling to find funding. It was paying €7 million to Dallara stating that "sometime we have the money sometime we don't". He also denied that F1 hopeful Stefan GP had taken the Campos' car. He stated that "we've got a contract and as long as we're paying the contract is valid". In February, speculation began as to whether Campos would actually make the 2010 field. The team admitted budgetary problems. 

On February 19, it was announced that majority shareholder José Ramón Carabante had taken over full control of the team from Adrián Campos. Colin Kolles also replaced him as team principal. The team was re-named to Hispania Racing F1 Team (HRT), with the name taken from Grupo Hispania, one of Carabante's companies. The team's headquarters were moved to Grupo Hispania's offices in Murcia. On March 4, Karun Chandhok was confirmed as the team's second driver. The team launched their Cosworth-powered, Dallara-designed car on the same day; it was called the Hispania F110.

With no pre-season testing, the F110 completed its first laps during the weekend of the Bahrain Grand Prix. Senna's car was completed in time for him to complete three installation (first test lap) laps in the first free practice session. In the second session, he completed 17 laps, running over 11 seconds off the pace. He then slid off the track after his wheel came loose. Senna described the day's work as a "great start", considering the team's lack of preparation. 

Chandhok's did not complete any laps in the Friday practice. The mechanics were unable to make the clutch and gearbox on the car work. In qualifying, Senna and Chandhok set the two slowest times to share the back row of the starting grid: Chandhok was finally able to complete his car's first laps at speed. 

For the race, both cars started from the pit lane. Chandhok crashed on the second lap and was out of the race. Senna retired on lap 18 with an overheating engine. Hispania finally had both car finish the race at the Malaysian Grand Prix with Chandhok finishing in front of Senna. Chandhok was 3 laps down and Senna was 4 laps down. 

In Turkish Grand Prix, the team's test driver Sakon Yamamoto completed the first practice session, and ran the slowest time of the session.

On the eve of the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Hispania announced that Bruno Senna had been dropped for the race. Yest driver Sakon Yamamoto would race in his place. After the race, HRT announced that Senna would return after Silverstone. Yamamoto has replaced Chandhok for the German Grand Prix and the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Hispania parted company with Dallara in May 2010. The partnership between the two companies had become tense due to the car's lack of performance. The team is seeking a new technical deal to assist in the construction of its chassis.

When Hispania was still under the Campos name, team owner José Ramón Carabante said in an interview with Autosport that Campos Meta F1/HRT were eyeing a Ferrari engine supply for the season. Colin Kolles said in an interview with Diario AS in July 2010, that talks about a partnership with Toyota was an option for 2011. Hispania continues to use Cosworth engines for 2011.

The first race of the the 2011 season was the Australian Grand Prix. Hispania was not ready to race yet. The new chassis, the F111, had not been ready during the off season testing. During the weekend at Australia, the team was still putting the cars together. Karthikeyan and Liuzzi had to qualify in cars without any practice. Because of this, they were not fast enough to qualify for the race.

The fastest lap time during the first qualifying session was 1m 25.296s. Based on the new 107% rule, the minimum qualifying time was 1m 31.266s. Both Hispania cars were at least one second slower than the minimum time.

 Season in progress.

2010 Israel-Lebanon clash

The 2010 Israeli–Lebanese clash occurred on August 3, 2010 when IDF and Lebanese Army Forces engaged in cross-border shootouts. Initial reports say three Lebenese soldiers and one civilian were killed while five soldiers were wounded; reports also indicated 1 Israeli soldier was killed and 2 were wounded. This was the most serious escalation on the border since the 2006 Lebanon War.

Israeli-Lebanese conflict

The Israeli–Lebanese conflict describes a series of related military clashes involving Israel, Lebanon, and Syria, as well as various non-state militias acting from within Lebanon.

The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) recruited militants in Lebanon from among the families of Palestinian refugees who had been expelled or fled due to the creation of Israel in 1948. By 1968, the PLO and Israel were committing cross border attacks against each other. After the PLO leadership and its Fatah brigade were expelled from Jordan for fomenting a revolt, they entered Lebanon and the cross-border violence increased. Meanwhile, demographic tensions over the Lebanese National Pact lead to the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990). Israel's 1978 invasion of Lebanon pushed the PLO north of the Litani River, but the PLO continued their campaign against Israel. Israel invaded Lebanon again in 1982 and forcibly expelled the PLO. Israel withdrew to a slim borderland buffer zone, held with the aid of proxy militants in the South Lebanon Army (SLA). In 1985, a Lebanese Shi'te resistance movement sponsored by Iran, calling itself Hezbollah, called for armed struggle to end the Israel occupation of Lebanese territory. When the Lebanese civil war ended and other warring factions agreed to disarm, Hezbollah and the SLA refused. Combat with Hezbollah weakened Israeli resolve and led to a collapse of the SLA and an Israeli withdrawal in 2000 to their side of the UN designated border. Citing Israeli control of the Shebaa farms territory, Hezbollah continued cross border attacks intermittently over the next six years. Hezbollah now sought freedom for Lebanese citizens in Israeli prisons and successfully used the tactic of capturing Israeli soldiers as leverage for a prisoner exchange in 2004. The capturing of two Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah ignited the 2006 Lebanon War. Its ceasefire called for the disarmament of Hezbollah and the remaining armed camps of the PLO, and for Lebanon to control its southern border militarily for the first time in four decades.

Hostilities were suspended as of 8 September 2006. As of 2009 Hezbollah had not disarmed. On 18 June 2008, Israel declared that it was open to peace talks with Lebanon.

Arab–Israeli conflict

The Arab–Israeli conflict is a term used to describe the political tensions and open hostilities between the Arab people of the Middle East and the Jewish community of present-day Israel. The conflict has been around for more than a century. Some say that the conflict began when large-scale Jewish immigration to Palestine started, especially after the start of the Zionist movement. The conflict became stronger when the modern state of Israel was created, on land that the Jewish people saw as their historical homeland, but the Pan-Arab movement saw as belonging to the Arabs, whether Muslim, Christian, Druze or other (and in the Pan-Islamic context, in territory regarded as Muslim lands).

The conflict started as a political and nationalist conflict when the collapse of the Ottoman Empire created tension over the division and ownership of the land.

Napoleon and Tabitha D'umo

Napoleon Buddy D'umo (born October 17, 1968) and Tabitha A. D'umo (née Cortopassi born September 11, 1973), also known as Nappytabs, are husband and wife choreographers who are often credited with developing the new style of hip-hop dance known as lyrical hip-hop. They have been working together in the dance industry since 1996 and are best known for their choreography on the TV show "So You Think You Can Dance". They were nominated for a 2009 Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography for their work on the fourth season of the show. Napoleon and Tabitha are also supervising choreographers on MTV's "America's Best Dance Crew".

Napoleon and Tabitha started their career in Las Vegas while they were still in college choreographing industrial musicals for large businesses. After moving to Los Angeles, they began teaching hip-hop dance classes and choreographing for professional basketball and football dance teams including the Orlando Magic and the Dallas Cowboys. Their career improved to choreographing music videos, commercials, films, television shows, and concerts. Napoleon and Tabitha have worked with entertainers such as Missy Elliott, Celine Dion, Kanye West, Ricky Martin, and Jennifer Lopez. They also appeared in the dance documentary "MOVE" and choreographed Cirque Du Soleil's "Viva ELVIS" show. In addition to choreography and teaching classes, they direct concert tours and live events and have their own dance clothing line called "Nappytabs".

While growing up in Victorville, California, Napoleon learned how to dance by traveling to Los Angeles and spending time with b-boys; he was eventually cast as an extra in the movie "Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo" in 1984. After graduating from Apple Valley High School, Napoleon joined the US military and was sent to Germany. After he was discharged from the military, he attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) where he majored in molecular biology. In college, Napoleon started taking jazz dance and modern dance classes. He eventually received a full scholarship as a member of the university's dance team.

Tabitha grew up in Galloway, New Jersey. Her mother, Cynthia Cortopassi, enrolled her in jazz dance classes when she was young. Since there were no hip-hop classes, Tabitha learned by watching music videos and participating in her high school's cheer and dance teams. She names Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, and Paula Abdul as influences. After graduating from Absegami High School, Tabitha moved to Nevada to attend UNLV where she majored in communications and started taking hip-hop dance classes. It was there that she met her future husband Napoleon.

Tabitha and Napoleon started their professional partnership in 1996 while still in college as part of the dance company Culture Shock. During their time with Culture Shock, they choreographed a variety of industrial musicals—musicals performed for the employees of a business to motivate/entertain—for companies such as Nike, Levi, Redken, Matrix Hair, and MAC. Although Tabitha was planning to take a job in public relations and Napoleon was planning to attend medical school, they both decided when they graduated college to pursue a career in the dance industry.

Napoleon and Tabitha have choreographed for sports teams, movies, television, and for the stage. They have choreographed for NFL and NBA dance teams including the Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos, Chicago Bulls, and Orlando Magic. Some of the celebrities they have worked with include Sean Kingston, Jennifer Lopez, Carrie Underwood, Celine Dion, Missy Elliott, Destiny's Child, and Timbaland. Their television/film work includes the Emmy Awards, the Special Olympics, the Grammy Awards, "Soul Train", "Legally Blonde", "Mr. Fix It" and MTV's "Rock the Cradle".

Napoleon and Tabitha have been supervising choreographers for "America's Best Dance Crew" since season one in 2008. In an interview with Zap2it.com, Napoleon spoke of his excitement about how the show brings dancers from the background to the front.

Also in 2008, the couple took on hosting duties for "Rock the Reception" on TLC. On the show they created wedding dances for engaged couples to perform for the guests at the wedding reception. A day before the premiere of the show, they appeared on ABC's "The View" in order to promote it. 

In February 2010, they provided choreography for Cirque Du Soleil's "Viva ELVIS" show at the Aria Resort & Casino in Las Vegas. The following March, they choreographed a pilot episode for a new dance TV show starring Paula Abdul and Kenny Ortega. In July, they choreographed a hip-hop routine for Seattle Theatre Group's 12th Annual "DANCE This" concert. In September, they choreographed a pilot episode for another dance television show called MOBBED. 

In 2008, Napoleon and Tabitha joined the choreography and judging team on Fox's "So You Think You Can Dance" (SYTYCD). It was on this show that their lyrical hip-hop style gained popularity. The term "lyrical hip-hop" was created by SYTYCD judge Adam Shankman when he commented on a routine choreographed by Napoleon and Tabitha to Leona Lewis' song "Bleeding Love".

This routine was later nominated for a 2009 Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography. Tabitha has said that they do not create choreography without a story because the story determines the movement and the feeling they want to show: "We listen to the song over and over and over and finally we find that skeleton and then we can start preparing some steps."

In April 2009, Napoleon and Tabitha choreographed three dance routines for the second season of "So You Think You Can Dance Australia". SYTYCD Australia judge and choreographer Matt Lee called their "Dead and Gone" lyrical hip-hop routine the best routine of the season. Later that year in September, Napoleon and Tabitha choreographed the opening dance performance on the season seven premiere of The Ellen Degeneres Show. The performance featured both DeGeneres and the top 10 dancers from season five of "So You Think You Can Dance".

Tabitha and Napoleon returned to "So You Think You Can Dance" for seasons six and seven. On season seven they choreographed routines for both the contestants as well as for two guest performers. One guest performance was for the English pop singer Natasha Bedingfield and another, choreographed with Mandy Moore, was for the cast of Cirque du Soleil's "Beatles LOVE". Napoleon and Tabitha have been with "So You Think You Can Dance" since season four. They have created dance routines for both couples and groups:

Napoleon and Tabitha spend a lot of time teaching classes at dance studios and conventions—regional educational events hosted by professional dancers. They teach hip-hop dance at Millennium Dance Complex, at the Edge Performing Arts Center and online through DancePlug.com. They are also faculty members at Xtreme Dance Force, Shock the Intensive, Coastal Dance Rage, iHollywood, and Monsters of Hip Hop dance conventions. In addition to their permanent teaching positions, they were guest instructors at Project 818 in Moscow, Russia and judges at the 2009 Australian Hip Hop Championships in Sydney.

Most of Napoleon and Tabitha's work is in choreography and teaching but they have also provided creative direction for tours and live events. Creative directors are responsible for the design, vision, and theme of a show. In 2006 and 2007, they served as assistant creative directors for Christina Aguilera’s "Back to Basics Tour" and for Ricky Martin’s "Black and White Tour". In 2008, they were assistant creative directors for Celine Dion's "Taking Chances Tour" and Kanye West’s "Glow in the Dark Tour".

Also in 2008, they were the lead creative directors for "Monsters of Hip Hop: The Show", the "So You Think You Can Dance Tour", and "America's Best Dance Crew Live".

In 2009, they directed the second "So You Think You Can Dance Tour" and in 2010 they directed the Jabbawockeez' MÜS.I.C (muse-i-see) show at the MGM Grand Las Vegas hotel and casino.

Napoleon and Tabitha have their own line of dance clothing line called "Nappytabs". "Nappytabs" is the first line of hip-hop dance clothing. They decided to create it because of the lack of appropriate dance clothing for urban hip-hop dancers. For this reason, it is sold at selected regional dance clothing stores, major dance conventions, online through the "Nappytabs" official website, and at their only retail location and dance studio in North Hollywood.

In 2007, Tabitha was the host of an exercise DVD titled "Drop it with Dance".
The video is split into six 10-minute routines that gradually increase in difficulty; movements from all six routines are combined in the finale "Showtime" segment. Tabitha also appeared in "Rock Your Body", a dance/fitness DVD hosted by choreographer and creative director Jamie King who is known primarily for his work with Madonna.

Napoleon and Tabitha appeared in the dance documentary "MOVE". The film is about dance as an art form and how notable choreographers were able to go from dancing as a hobby to dancing as a career. There are over fifty dance professionals who appear in this film including director and choreographer Kenny Ortega.

Hansen states that we immediately need to "reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide to at most 350 ppm in order to avoid disasters for coming generations". He says that we need to reduce coal plant emissions, and improve forestry and agricultural practices.

"Storms of My Grandchildren" has been reviewed in "Nature, the Los Angeles Times", "Science", and "Cosmos".

<doc id="257603" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=257603" title="Star of Bethlehem">
Star of Bethlehem

The Star of Bethlehem, also called the Christmas Star, is a star in the Bible and Christian tradition that let the Magi know that Jesus was born, and later helped them go to Bethlehem. According to the Gospel of Matthew, the star made the magi travel to Jerusalem. There they met King Herod of Judea, and asked where the king of the Jews had been born. Herod's advisors said that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem, a nearby village, because of a prophecy by Micah. While the magi were going to Bethlehem, they saw the star again. The star stopped above the place where Jesus was born. There, the magi saw Jesus with his mother, worshipped him and gave costly presents to him. They then returned to their "own country".

Christians usually think of the star as a miraculous sign to show the birth of the Christ. Astronomers have thought of many different explanations for the star. A nova, a planet, a comet, an occultation, and a conjunction (planets coming together) have all been suggested.

Some scholars say that the story is not historically right and that the star was not real.

The Star of Bethlehem is a well-loved subject at planetarium shows during Christmas, but the Bible seems to suggest that the magi visited Jesus at least several months after he was born.The visit is usually celebrated on Epiphany (January 6) in Western Christianity and on Christmas (December 25) in Eastern Christianity.

The Gospel of Matthew says that Magi (usually translated as "wise men", but probably meaning here "astronomer" or "astrologer") came to the court of Herod in Jerusalem and told the king of a star which marked the birth of the King of the Jews:
Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold (see), wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, saying, "Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East" [or "at its rising"] "and have come to worship Him." When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them (asked) where the Christ was to be born.
Herod was "troubled"–not about the star, but because a "king of the Jews" had been born. He understood that this meant the Messiah. The Messiah was a leader of the Jewish people, and had been spoken of in Old Testament prophecies. So he asked his helpers where the Messiah would be born. They replied that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem, the place where King David was born, remembering what the prophet Micah had said. The king told this to the magi.
Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, determined from them what time the star appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the young Child, and when you have found Him, bring back word to me, that I may come and worship Him also." When they heard the king, they departed (went away); and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly (very) great joy.
Matthew suggests that the magi knew from the star that the "king of the Jews" had already been born even before they entered Jerusalem. They gave Jesus gold, frankincense, and myrrh as presents. The magi were told in a dream not to go back to Jerusalem. So, they "left for their own country by another road". When Herod found out that he had been tricked, he ordered all male children in Bethlehem who were 2 or younger to be killed. Joseph was warned in a dream to escape. He took his family to Egypt to be safe. The Gospel connects the escape to a verse from the Old Testament, which is seen as a prophecy: "Out of Egypt I called My Son." The Old Testament verse was about how the Hebrews went away from Egypt, led by Moses. Because of this, the quote seems to suggest that Matthew thought that Jesus' life was like the story of the Jewish people. Judea could have symbolized Egypt and Herod represented pharaoh. After Herod died, God called Joseph and his family back from Egypt, and they settled in to Nazareth in Galilee.

One way to interpret the Star of Bethlehem is to find the year in which Jesus was born. Matthew wrote that Jesus was born when Herod was king. According to Josephus, Herod died shortly after a lunar eclipse. This lunar eclipse is often thought of as the eclipse of March 13, 4 BC. Those who ruled after Herod used coins showing that they dated their rules as beginning in 4 BC. Because of this, it is mostly thought that Herod died that year. However, some still disagree with this idea.

From long ago, many people believed that the movements of the stars were connected with the things that happened on earth. Miracles were often thought to happen at the same time important people were born.

The Star of Bethlehem is traditionally linked to the Star Prophecy in the Book of Numbers:

By the time the Gospels were written, it was thought by many people that it was about the coming of a Messiah. For example, Josephus quoted it (though he thought it was about Emperor Vespasian).

Paintings and other works of art about the magi's visit may include the star. In the fresco by Giotto di Bondone, it is in the shape of a comet. In a tapestry about the Magi, designed by Edward Burne-Jones, the star is held by an angel.

Christmas songs often describe the Star of Bethlehem. For example, "We Three Kings" has the words:

O star of wonder, star of light,<br>
Star with royal beauty bright,<br>
Westward leading, still proceeding,<br>
Guide us to thy perfect light.<br>

Kiddieland Amusement Park

Kiddieland Amusement Park was an amusement park located just west of Chicago at the corner of North Avenue and First Avenue in Melrose Park, Illinois. It was home to several classic rides including the "Little Dipper" roller coaster, which opened in 1950. The park closed on September 27, 2009 at 8 PM.

Kiddieland started out as a small venture of Arthur Fritz in 1929 when he purchased six ponies and offered rides as an escape for parents reeling from the Great Depression. Miniature gasoline-powered cars were added a few years later after Fritz learned that they were being given away to children by a Chicago newspaper as a subscription promotion.

In 1940, the "German Carousel", two Miniature Steam Locomotives, the "Little Auto Ride", the "Roto Whip" and the "Ferris Wheel" were added. The latter two lasted until the park's closing. The park saw its first major expansion in the 1950s with the addition of the Little Dipper and the Carousel, of which both still exist today. Bumper cars were added in the 1960s as they replaced the original pony ride.

The park transferred ownership in 1977, as Arthur Fritz's grandchildren took over the park and its operation. The park continued its expansion and installed several major attractions, including a Log flume, a swinging pirate ship, a long water coaster, and numerous other attractions.

A dispute developed between Shirley and Glenn Rynes, who own the land that Kiddieland occupies, and Ronald Rynes, Jr. and Cathy and Tom Norini, who own the amusement park itself. The landowners sued the park owners in 2004, claiming that the park had an improper insurance policy and that fireworks were prohibited in the lease. The case was thrown out in a Cook County court and later in an appeals court. The landowners declined to extend the lease on the land in early 2009. In late June 2010, it was announced that Kiddieland would be demolished, nine months after the park was officially closed. A Costco will be built in its place.

The Litter Dipper was designed by Herbert Schmeck and built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company in 1950. The brakes are operated manually by a wooden handle in the station. The out-and-back coaster is tall and travels a course of . It was awarded the ACE Coaster Classic award by the American Coaster Enthusiasts.
Six Flags Great America bought the ride in November 2009 at a Kiddieland auction. The ride cost $33,000.

Formula One World Championship scoring system

This is a Formula One World Championship scoring system used by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA uses this system to decide the FIA World Drivers' and Constructors' Championships since the season. The Championships are awarded to the driver and constructor (car builder) who score the most points over the course of the season.

From through , a championship point was awarded to the driver (and team starting in that set the fastest lap.

In some seasons, not all race results would be counted towards the World Championship. Only a certain number of a driver's best results would count. In this cause a very unusuall result. Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna were the drivers for McLaren. They were the best two drivers of that year. There were 16 races that year, but only the best 11 results counted towards the championship. Prost won seven races and finished seventh races in second place. He scored a total of 105 points, but only 87 of them counted for the championship. Senna won eight races and finished second in three, giving him 90 points for the championship and 94 for the season. This resulted in the strange event where Prost took a record number of points, yet Senna won the champion. A new system system counting all races was introduced in . One additional point was also awarded to the race winner.

The current system was introduced for the season. It was designed to allow more teams and drivers to score points. 

The most dominant Drivers' Champion in terms of points scored is Jim Clark. Clark scored the maximum of 54 points (6 wins) in both 1963 and 1965. In recent years, Michael Schumacher finished on the podium (one of the top three finishers) in every race of the 2002 season. Schumacher scored 144 of a maximum 170 points. The most dominant Constructors' Champion in recent times was McLaren in 1988. McLaren scored 199 of a maximum 240 points available. McLaren finised 134 points ahead of the second place team. In , Ferrari scored 221 points of a maximum 340 points available. Ferrari finished 129 points ahead of the second place team.

Melaleuca leucadendra

Melaleuca leucadendra is a tree which belongs to the "Melaleuca" genus. It is largely distributed in the northern parts of Australia (Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland). It is also found further north in the Solomon Islands and in New Guinea. The "Melaleuca leucadendra" is similar to the "Broad-leaf Paperbark" ("Melaleuca quinquenervia"), which has a thick spongy bark. However, the "Melaleuca leucadendra"'s foliage is of a brighter green and it has a slightly weeping habit.

"Melaleuca leucadendra" is also given the common name Cajuput Tree, which is derived from the Malay word "kayu putih" (old Indonesian spelling: "kaju putih") - meaning "white wood". Cajuput oil can be distilled from its leaves.

Silverstone Circuit

Silverstone Circuit is an English motor racing circuit next to the Northamptonshire villages of Silverstone and Whittlebury. Nearly half of the circuit is across the Northamptonshire boundary in Buckinghamshire. The closest large towns are Northampton and Milton Keynes. It is best known as the home of the British Grand Prix, which it first hosted in 1948 and which has been held on the circuit every year since 1987. The circuit is also home to the BRDC International Trophy, awarded to the winner of a race for historic F1 cars at the annual Silverstone Classic meeting.

Silverstone Circuit is built on the site of RAF Silverstone, a World War II Royal Air Force bomber station. RAF Silverstone opened in 1943. 

Silverstone was first used for racing by a group of friends who set up their own race in September 1947. Maurice Geoghegan, lived in Silverstone village and was knew that the airfield was deserted. He and eleven other drivers raced over a two mile circuit. Geoghegan's car ran over a sheep and killed it. The car was beyond repair. This informal race became known as the "Mutton Grand Prix".

The next year the Royal Automobile Club leased the airfield and set-up a more formal racing circuit. Their first two races were held on the runways, with long straights and tight hairpin corners. For 1948, it was decided to switch to the perimeter track. This arrangement was used for the and British Grands Prix. Several small changes were made in the track before the track underwent a major redesign after the race. 

Following the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix, many Grand Prix circuits were modifed in order to reduce speed and increase driver safety. The entry from Hangar Straight into Stowe Corner was modified in 1995 so as to make its entry less dangerous and less challenging. The high speed Abbey kink was changed to a chicane in just 19 days before the Grand Prix.

Silverstone has suffered with bad traffic delays on race days. The traffic problem was improved when the the A43 Silverstone bypass was built. When the race date was moved to April in 2000] heavy rain turned the fields used for parking into mud pits, causing severe problems for the spectators trying to park. On F1 race day many spectators travel to the circuit by helicopter. Silverstone Heliport is the busiest airport in the UK for this day.

Silverstone is the current home of the British Grand Prix, which it first hosted in 1948. The British Grand Prix at Silverstone was the first race in the newly-created Formula One World Championship. The race rotated between Silverstone, Aintree and Brands Hatch from 1955 to 1986. In 1987 the rotation stopped and the race stayed at Silverstone.

In 2004, Silverstone was in danger of losing the Grand Prix. There was even the possibility that the British Grand Prix would not be run in 2005. In December an agreement was reached with Formula One Silverstone would host the British Grand Prix until 2009. Starting in 2010 Donington Park would become the new host of the British Grand Prix. Then the Donington Park leaseholders ran into economic problems. A new deal with Formula One resulted in a 17 year deal to hold the British Grand Prix at Silverstone.

The Dunlop MSA British Touring Car Championship withdrew the track from its calendar in 2007. Strong demand brought the series back to Silverstone for the 2008 BTCC calendar. Silverstone also hosts rounds of the FIA GT, British Superbikes, British F3, British GT and Le Mans Series championships as well as many club racing series. It is also host to the UK's only 24-hour car race, the Britcar 24, which is gaining in popularity, having first started in 2005.

It has in the past hosted exhibition rounds of the D1 Grand Prix both in 2005 and 2006. The course makes use of both Brooklands and Luffield corners to form an S-bend – a requirement in drifting. The section is currently used to host a European Drift Championship round. The Course also hosts the Formula Student Competition by the iMeche yearly.

In 2010 Silverstone hosted its very first Superleague Formula event.

Both the FIM and Silverstone agree the circuit needs to be remodeled for motorcycle racing. The riders are concerned over the closeness of the bridge at Bridge corner.

On 22 January 2010 it was confirmed that Silverstone would host the British round of the 2010 Superbike World Championship season. The race was moved after Donington Park was deemed "un-raceable".

Like most racing circuits around the world, the Silverstone Circuit has a number of different layouts. The layouts offer different lengths and complexity.

<doc id="257745" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=257745" title="Lovely Rita">
Lovely Rita

"Lovely Rita" is a song by The Beatles performed on the album "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", written and sung by Paul McCartney, although as with all McCartney-written Beatles songs it is credited to Lennon/McCartney. It is about a female parking attendant and the narrator's love for her.

The term "meter-maid" was largely unknown in the UK prior to the song's release. It is American slang for a female traffic warden, now officially known by the gender-neutral term parking attendant. According to some sources, the song emanates from when a female traffic warden named Meta Davis gave a parking ticket to McCartney outside Abbey Road Studios. Instead of becoming angry, he accepted it with good grace and expressed his feelings in song. When asked why he had called her "Rita", McCartney replied, "Well, she looked like a Rita to me".

Recording began on 23 February 1967. Using a four-track recorder, this first performance featured Harrison's guitar on track 1, Lennon's guitar on track 2, Ringo's drums on track 3, and McCartney's piano set on track 4. The band later added lead vocal, bass, and a three-part backing vocal section. By 21 March, the final mono mix was completed and a month later, the stereo mix was done.

The unusual noises during the song after the lines "and the bag across her shoulder/ made her look a little like a military man" were John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison playing comb and paper. Mal Evans was sent to Abbey Road's lavatories to get toilet paper (which was stamped with the words, "PROPERTY OF EMI"). This was used to cover hair combs, which they blew through to sound like a kazoo orchestra.

Pink Floyd watched the Beatles recording "Lovely Rita". It is rumored that "Lovely Rita" influenced the song "Pow R. Toc H." found on their first album, "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn".

Shawn Phillips has said in an interview that he performed background vocals on the track.
