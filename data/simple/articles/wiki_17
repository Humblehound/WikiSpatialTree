Yun Poson

Yun Bo-seon (Korea:윤보선, August 26, 1897 – July 18, 1990) was the President of South Korea from 1960 to 1962. nickname was Haewi(해위). newphew of Yun Chi-ho.

He was born in Asan, South Chungcheong province, Yun graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1930. He entered politics after Japanese occupation ended in 1945, with Syngman Rhee being his mentor. In 1948, Yun was made mayor of Seoul by Rhee. A year later, he was made the Minister of Commerce and Industry. Soon, he started to disagree with Rhee's authoritarian policies. He then served as president of the Red Cross Society, before being elected to the National Assembly in 1954. A year later, he founded the opposition Democratic Party along with several others.

After Rhee's government was ousted by a student-led pro-democracy uprising, Yun was elected president on August 13, 1960. He was merely a figurehead, as South Korea had switched to a parliamentary system in response to the authoritarian excesses of Rhee's regime. After Park Chung Hee's coup in 1961, he stayed on briefly to provide legitimacy to the regime, but resigned on March 22, 1962. He opposed Park's authoritarian rule and ran for president twice in 1963 and 1967, losing each time. After receiving suspended sentences several times for anti-government activities, Yun retired from politics in 1980 and focused primarily on cultural activities until his death from diabetes and high blood pressure. He died in 1990.

Rhee Syng-man

Syngman Rhee or Lee Seungman or Yee Sung-man (Korea:이승만, March 26, 1875 – July 19, 1965) was Korean Independent activities, and politicians. the first president of South Korea. His presidency, from August 1948 to April 1960, remains controversial, affected by Cold War tensions on the Korean peninsula and elsewhere. Rhee was a strong anti-Communist, and led South Korea through the Korean War. His presidency ended in resignation following popular protests against a disputed election. He died in exile in Hawaii.

Rhee was born in Whanghai Province to Rhee Kyong-sun, a member of the aristocratic Yangban family. Rhee was descended from Prince Hyo-nyong, the second son of King Taejong of Joseon. He soon became active in Korea's struggle against Japanese control. He was arrested in 1897 for demonstrating against the monarchy. After he was released in 1904 he went to the United States. He obtained several degrees, including a Ph.D. from Princeton University. He became so like an American that he began writing his name in the Western manner, with the personal name before the family name.

In 1910, he went back to Korea, which had by this time been taken over by Japan. His political actions got him into trouble with the Japanese army, and so he left for China in 1912. In 1919, all of the major pro-independence groups formed the Provisional Government in Shanghai. Rhee was elected the president, a post he held until 1925 when he was removed by the Provisional Assembly for the misuse of his authority.

At the end of World War 2 , Rhee returned to Seoul. This was before the other independence leaders, since he was the only one well known to the Allies. In 1945, he was chosen as head of a provisional (short term) government. With the unspoken agreement of the occupation authorities, Rhee conducted a number of actions to "remove Communism". This was actually a hidden plan to remove all possible opposition to him.

Rhee was elected the first president of South Korea on 10 May, 1948 by a parliamentary vote. He defeated Kim Koo, the last president of the Provisional Government by 180 votes to 16. All the left-wing parties refused to take part in the election. On 15 August 1948, he formally took over from the US military and became the legal power over the Korean people. 

As president, Rhee took on dictatorial powers even before the Korean War started in 1950. He allowed the internal security force (headed by his right-hand man, Kim Chang-ryong) to put people in prison and torture them if they were thought to be Communists or North Korean agents. His government also directed several massacres, the most famous being on the island of Jeju. This was after an uprising by left-wing groups. While massacres did occur under governments that came after Rhee, there were not as many and less widespread. 

Rhee made himself unpopular by telling the people in Seoul to stay in the city when the Korean War started. He had already left. His decision to cut the bridges on the Han River stopped thousands of people from escaping from the Communists. The UN and South Korean forces fought back and drove the North Koreans north towards the Yalu River. After a Chinese counterattack they UN and South Korean were pushed back to the current DMZ. Rhee became unpopular with the US and the UN for refusing to agree to a number of peace plans that would have left Korea divided. He wanted to become the leader of a united Korea with UN assistance. He tried to stop any peace plan that would not remove the northern government completely. He also argued for stronger military action to be used against China. He was annoyed because the US would not bomb China.

On January 18, 1952, Rhee declared South Korean rule over the waters around the Korean peninsula. This was an idea the same as today's exclusive economic zones. The new border, which Rhee called the "Peace Line", included Tsushima Island and the uninhabited islands named Dokdo. This led to protests from the Japanese government. They claimed that the islands were Japanese territory. Minor clashes followed, but the islands have been under South Korean administration since then.
Throughout his rule, Rhee took extra steps to keep his control over the government. In May 1952 Rhee pushed through constitutional changes which made the presidency a directly-elected position. So he could get this passed by parliament he declared martial law. He jailed the members of parliament he thought would vote against it. Rhee was subsequently elected by big majority. He regained control of parliament in the 1954 elections. He pushed through an amendment to exempt himself from the eight-year limit on presidents.

Rhee's chances for reelection during the presidential campaign of 1956 seemed small. People did not think he should be allowed to be President three times. The main opposition candidate Shin Ik-hee drew large crowds during his campaign. Shin's sudden death while on the campaign trail, however, allowed Rhee to win the presidency with ease. The runner-up of that election, Cho Bong-am of the Progressive Party, was later charged with spying and executed in 1959.

By 1960, Rhee had already served three terms in office. His next victory was certain after the main opposition candidate, Cho Byeong-ok, died shortly before the March 15 elections. Rhee won with 90% of the vote. The real contest was in the race for vice president. This was held separately under the law of the time. Yi Gi-bung, who Rhee thought should take over after him, was declared the winner of an election that the opposition claimed was rigged. This created anger among groups of the Korean people. A student-led April 19 Movement forced Rhee to resign on April 26. 

On April 28, a DC-4 belonging to the CIA operated Civil Air Transport took Rhee out of South Korea. This was to rescue him from the angry crowds. Kim Yong Kap, Rhee's Deputy Minister of Finance, revealed that President Rhee had taken $20 million in government money for himself. Rhee, his Austrian-born wife, Francisca Donner, and adopted son lived in exile in Honolulu, Hawaii. On July 19, 1965, Rhee died of a stroke. His body was returned to Seoul and buried in the National Cemetery on July 27, 1965.

Rhee's legacy has been in considerable dispute. In general, conservative circles regard Rhee as the patriarch of the nation, while liberals tend to be critical of him.

Rhee's former residence in Seoul, Ihwajang, is currently used for the presidential memorial museum, and Woo-Nam Presidential Preservation Foundation has been set up to honour his legacy.

Canonization

Canonisation is a statement by a church saying that someone is a saint. This process is used by some Christian churches, most commonly in the Roman Catholic Church. The person must be dead, because living people cannot be canonised.

The process of canonisation involves proving that the person lived in a way that justifies this decision. They must have loved others and loved God. In the Catholic Church, at least two miracles by the saint's intercession must be proven. This means that, because the person is believed to be in heaven, someone must pray, or ask, for the saint to pray for them in heaven. If the prayer is answered and a miracle happens, then they know that the person is a saint. The miracles prove that the saint must be in heaven with God, and able to ask God for prayers to be answered.

These people then enter into the canon, or list, of saints.

It is not correct to say that the Church "makes" someone a saint. The Catholic Church believes that anyone who is in heaven is already a saint. The canonisation process just finds out for sure, or without a doubt, that someone is a saint.

Ramananda Prasad

Ramananda Prasad (born 1938) is the founder of the International Gita Society. He has translated the Bhagavad Gita into English in 1988 from the Sanskrit text.

Prasad was born in Hargawan, Bihar to a farmer who had three acres of land and six children to support. By hard work, his father was somehow able to send his sons to college. Ramanand had his pre-school education in the village from the late Mazahirul Haque, a Muslim headmaster who taught him English and Mathematics. After finishing his high school education at Mahadeva High School, Khusrupur, he passed his high school from Patna College in 1953. He attended Patna Science College from 1953-55 and is a 1959 graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, India, obtained his Master's Degree from the University of Toronto and earned his doctorate in Civil Engineering from the University of Illinois. Since then, he has been involved in research, teaching, engineering and consulting and worked for the U. S. Navy Corps of Engineers before retiring in 2000. He is presently a professor of Civil Engineering at San Jose State University and an adjunct professor of religion and psychology at the Union Institute in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Dr. Prasad has founded several non-profit organizations in the San Francisco Bay Area such as the "Vedic Dharma Samaj" that now runs the Fremont Hindu temple, "Ramayan Sabha", and the "Universal Yoga Center" of San Francisco. He is married to Sadhana Prasad, a devotee of Lord Shiva and has one daughter, Reeta Raina who is married to Abhinav Raina and one son, Sanjay Prasad, who now directs the activities of the International Gita Society. He also has two Grandsons, Jay Raina and Raj Krishan Raina.

Prasad created the American Gita Society (later renamed the International Gita Society) in 1984 in order to foster unity and goodwill between all religions and faiths of the world, through the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. Its initial focus was to put copies of Bhagavad-Gita in libraries, hotels, motels, hospitals all over the world as the American Bible Society does with copies of the New Testament. In his translation, he borrows allied concepts liberally from the Koran, Bible, Dhammapada, and many other Hindu texts in order to get his message across that all faiths are ultimately one, while nonetheless giving supremacy to the stature of the Gita.

Lord

A Lord (Laird in some Scottish contexts) is a person who has power and authority. Women will usually (but not universally) take the title 'Lady' instead of Laird or Lord. But there is an example of a female Lord: "Lord of Mann", the ruler of the Isle of Man.

The word actually comes from the Old English forms for "loaf" (bread) and "ward" (used to mean "protector", although today it means "one who is protected"). So a "lord" or "loaf ward" was originally "the one who protected the loaf". 

In a religious context, The Lord means God, mainly by the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Islam, and Christianity).

<doc id="46430" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46430" title="Interval (music)">
Interval (music)

An interval in music means the distance between two notes (whether these notes are played together or separately).

Two notes on a keyboard which are next to one another (counting both white and black notes) are a “semitone” apart. A “tone” is two semitones (see semitone). However, an “interval” depends on how the notes are written (what they are called) e.g. whether the black note between D and E is written as D sharp or E flat (which are two different names for the same note).

In a major scale there are eight notes e.g. a C major scale (see above) is:
C D E F G A B C and down again.




(this is always so long as the letter name has not changed).

Examples:

It is important to realize that, in order to work out what an interval is, the lower note should be treated as the first note of the scale.

Examples:

Intervals can be “inverted” (turned upside down). For example: instead of going from a C up to an A (major 6th) we can go from C down to an A (minor 3rd).



Compound intervals are intervals bigger than an octave e.g.
C to D an octave and one more note above it is a major 9th.

Big intervals are called “wide” intervals. The opposite is a “narrow” interval.

Musical mode

Modes in music are a kind of scale.

The Ancient Greeks used several modes in their music. Medieval musicians borrowed the names of these modes to describe the scales used in their music. Today we usually use two modes: major and minor. A mode can start on any note.

Each mode has a different pattern of tones and semitones (or “half tones”) (see semitone).

tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone, tone, semitone.
tone, semitone, tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone.

The modes are easiest to see on a piano keyboard using the white notes only.
The Greeks had the following modes:

It will be seen that 

Each mode also has a version called “hypo—“.
For example: A to A is Hypodorian. It is the same as Aeolian, but the D is treated as the final note (we would say the “keynote”).

The names of the modes come from cities in Ancient Greece.

In the Middle Ages these modes were widely used in church music.

Some composers in recent centuries have enjoyed using the ancient modes from time to time in their music. Folksongs are often modal. Greensleeves is an example of a well-known tune which is modal.

Sharp

Sharp means that something can cut easily. Something that has a very narrow edge may be sharp. A mountain may have a sharp peak. A pointed nose is a sharp nose. 

A stone may be sharp and used for cutting. Knives and scissors are sharp. 
The opposite of sharp is blunt. If a knife has become blunt it will not cut easily. It needs to be sharpened.

Sharp can also mean "quick thinking" or "clever" e.g. "He had a sharp mind".

If a picture is sharp it is well in focus.

Jane Eyre

Jane Eyre is a book written by Charlotte Brontë. It was published in 1847 in England. It is Charlotte Brontë's most famous book.

Around this time, Charlotte was beginning to suffer a painful toothache, which made many of her teeth fall out. She was even more worried about her father's blindness. On 19 August 1846, Charlotte went to Manchester with her father to see an eye surgeon, William James Wilson. Wilson performed the operation on 25 August. The next day, Charlotte described it to her friend Ellen in a letter. Wilson had been helped by two other surgeons. The operation had taken about 15 minutes. Charlotte wrote, "Papa is now confined to his bed in a dark room and is not to be stirred for four days - He is to speak and to be spoken to as little as possible". "Depressed and weary (tired)", Charlotte began writing "Jane Eyre".

Charlotte did not have good eyes, so she wrote in little square books that she held close to her eyes. She wrote the first copy in pencil. When she left Manchester to go back home, she took the book with her and continued writing.

"Jane Eyre" is a love story. It tells about a young woman called Jane Eyre who was an orphan and goes to teach a girl named Adele Varens in a far-away house. The master of the house is Mr. Rochester. Jane and Mr. Rochester fall in love, but Jane is horrified when she finds out Mr. Rochester is already married to a crazy woman. She leaves the house, believing that marrying him would now be the same as adultery and that she would be his , not his wife. When she goes away, she becomes sick and almost dies. Three people, Diana, Mary, and St. John Rivers, find her and let her live with them. There, she becomes a teacher and finds out that they are her cousins. She is very happy until St. John wants her to marry him and be a missionary with him. She knows that he does not really love her and thinks she is simply useful, so she says no. However, he continues to ask her, and she is finally almost persuaded that it is her duty to marry him when she hears Mr. Rochester crying, "Jane! Jane!" She feels that something has happened to him, and quickly goes back to see him. His crazy wife had put his house on fire and died in it. Mr. Rochester, because of the fire, had become blind and wounded. Jane, now that his wife is dead, is happy to marry him, and they get married and have a son.

Fortification

Fortifications are military constructions and buildings designed for defense during war. People have constructed defensive works for many thousands of years, but the designs have become more and more complex. The term fortification comes from the Latin words "fortis" ("strong") and "facere" ("to make").

Many military installations are known as forts, although they are not always fortified. Larger forts may class as fortresses, smaller ones formerly often bore the name of fortalices. The word fortification can also mean the practice of improving an area's defense with defensive works. City walls are fortifications but not necessarily called fortresses.

Conjoined twins

Conjoined twins, also known as Siamese Twins are twins whose bodies are joined together at birth. This happens where the zygote of identical twins fails to completely separate. Conjoined twins occur in an estimated one in 200,000 births, and approximately half are stillborn. The overall survival rate for conjoined twins is between 5% and 25%. Conjoined twins are more likely to be female (70-75%). Daisy and Violet Hilton are a famous pair of conjoined twins. They were born in Brighton and were kept on top of the Evening Star pub, where they were taught to dance by a cruel barmaid. She then sold them and they toured Vaudeville. They became famous in the movie "Freaks" and lived long lives, eventually getting married.

Defensive wall

A defensive wall is a fortification used to defend a city from potential aggressors. In ancient to modern times, they were used to enclose settlements. Generally, these are referred to as city walls or town walls, although there were also walls, such as the Great Wall of China, Hadrian's Wall, and the metaphorical Atlantic Wall, which extended far beyond the borders of a city and were used to enclose regions or mark territorial boundaries. Beyond their defensive utility value many walls also had important symbolic functions — representing the status and independence of the communities they embraced.

Autolycus of Pitane

Autolycus of Pitane (ca. 360 BC—d. ca. 290 BC) was a Greek astronomer, mathematician, and geographer. He was born in Pitane, a town of Aeolis, in Asia Minor. His works were probably completed in Athens between the years 335 BC and 300 BC. Autolycus' surviving works include a book on spheres (called "On the Moving Sphere") and another on the rising and setting of celestial bodies. "On the Moving Sphere" is believed to be the oldest mathematical treatise from ancient Greece that is completely preserved. 

Euclid mentions Autolycus' work. Autolycus also taught Arcesilaus. 

Maurolycus translated Autolycus' works in the sixteenth century. 

Autolycus studied the movements of a sphere. It is believed they were the earliest written mathematics related books which have actually survived. Theodosius' "Sphaerics" was based on Autolycus' work on spheres. 

Autolycus studied the relationship between the rising and the setting of the celestial bodies, and wrote that "any star which rises and sets always rises and sets at the same point in the horizon."

He has a lunar crater named after him.

Hadrian's Wall

Hadrian's Wall (Latin: "Vallum Hadriani") is a stone and turf fortification built by the Roman Empire in northern England to stop attacks by Scottish tribes. There were three legions working on it and in 10 years it was nearly finished.

The Vallum is a huge earthwork associated with Hadrian's Wall. Unique on any Roman frontier, it runs from coast to coast to the south of the wall.

Begun in AD 122, during the rule of the emperor Hadrian, it was the first of two fortifications built across Great Britain. The second was the Antonine Wall, the lesser known of the two.

The wall was the most heavily fortified border in the Empire. In addition to its role as a military fortification, it is thought that many of the gates through the wall would have served as customs posts to allow trade and levy taxation.

A significant portion of the wall still exists, particularly the mid-section, and for much of its length the wall can be followed on foot by Hadrian's Wall Path or by cycle on National Cycle Route 72. 

It is the most popular tourist attraction in Northern England, where it is often known simply as the Roman Wall, or the Wall. It was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. English Heritage, a government quango in charge of managing the historic environment of England, describes it as "the most important monument built by the Romans in Britain".

<doc id="46530" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46530" title="Suwałki">
Suwałki

Suwałki is a city in northern Poland in voivodship of Podlaskie. It has about 69 100 inhabitants and os 65,24 km². 

The area of Suwałki has had people living on it since the early Middle Ages. However, with the coming of the Teutonic Order to Sudovia, their lands were captured and did not have many people living on it. The village was founded by monks, who were given the area around the future city in 1667 by the Grand Duke of Lithuania John II Casimir. Soon after the group of monks built its headquarters in Wigry, where a monastery and a church were built. The new owners of the area started fast use and building of the forests and brought enough settlers to build new villages in the area. Also, production of wood, lumber, tar and iron ore was started.

The town was cut into into 300 lots for future houses and its people were all given civil rights and did not have taxes for seven years. The town was also given 18.03 square kilometres of forest that was to be made into land to grow crops on. On May 2, 1720, by King August II let the city keep its rights, and the town was allowed to have one fair a week and four markets a year. A coat of arms was given also, with Saint Roch and Saint Romuald on it.
In 1794 the area was taken by Prussia. In 1796 the monastery in Wigry was closed and the ground that it was on was taken by the Prussian government. The next year local authorities were moved to the town, as well as a group of soldiers. By the end of 18th century, Suwałki had 1,184 people and 216 houses. Many of them were Jewish.

In 1807 Suwałki was taken by the Duchy of Warsaw. After losing Napoleon Bonaparte and the Congress of Vienna, the area was taken by Poland. The title of a powiat capital was gone for a short time, but it got the title back on January 16, 1816, when Augustów Voivodeship was made and its police were slowly moved to Suwałki. Soon after the old city hall was destroyed and replaced with a new one, and General Józef Zajączek paid for paving all the city's streets. Also, the graveyard was moved from the town centre to the edge of the town, and the area was made into a romantic city park. Also, a new road connecting Warsaw with St. Petersburg was built.
New streets were paved and new buildings were opened. In 1820 a new church was built and the following year the first synagogue opened. In 1829 a permanent post office was opened in Suwałki. Between 1806 and 1827 the number of people living in the town grew and reached 3,753 people living in 357 houses. In the November Uprising of 1831 the people living in the town took part in the fights against Russia, but the city was taken by the Russian army on February 11. In 1835 Tsar Nicholas I decided not to move the capital to Augustów and the fate of Suwałki was sealed. Two years later the town became the capital of Augustów Gubernia.

In 1826 new buildings were started by the state police. In 1835 a police station was finished, in 1844 a new town hall was finished, and Orthodox and Protestant churches. Soon after a new marketplace was opened, and St. Peter's and Paul's hospital and a gymnasium. Between 1840 and 1849 the main Catholic church was re-done Polish architects of the era, including Piotr Aigner, Antoni Corazzi and Henryk Marconi. In 1847 the city council passed a law banning building of new wooden houses.

The number of people living in the city kept growing quickly. In 1857 it had 11,273 people and in 1872 it had almost 20,000 people. New factories needed workers they came from all over the world. Because of that, the Polish-Jewish people was joined by people of many types of people that worshipped in the Russian Empire. Soon the city became the fourth biggest town in the Kingdom of Poland. After the January Uprising of 1863, a new a kind of government was made to join all of the Polish lands with Russia. In 1866 the gubernia of Augustów was named Suwałki Gubernia. However, the new Warsaw-Petersburg railroad passed by Suwałki and the town's growth ended.
After the spring of 1905, the time of Polish cultural re-building started. Although the Polish language was still kept from use, Polish schools and a library were opened. After the Great War broke out, there were fights for the area. In 1915, Suwałki was in German control. The town and nearby areas were broken from the rest of the Poland and were ruled by a German commander. Laws made by the German command led to the making of many secret social groups. In 1917, local branches of the Polska Organizacja Wojskowa were made.

After the end of the Central Powers in November 1918, the commander signed an agreement with the Temporary Council of the Suwałki Region and let the city back into Poland. However, the German army stayed in the city. In February 1919 the local people voted in the first elections to the Polish Sejm, but soon after the German commanders changed their minds and kept the Polish soldiers from the area and in May passed it to Lithuania to control. By the end of July the Paris Peace Conference gave the city to Poland and the Lithuanians left the city, but some of the Polish lands were left on the Lithuanian side of the border while several Lithuanian villages were left on the Polish side of the border. This led to the Sejny Uprising on August 23, 1919. To make the city safe, the next day Polish soldiers entered Suwałki. There was a Polish-Lithuanian War and for several days limited fights were fought for the control over Suwałki, Sejny and other towns in that area. The war ended because of the Entente in mid-September. During the Polish-Bolshevik War the city was captured by the Reds and after the Battle of Warsaw it was again given to the Lithuanians, but it was taken by the Polish Army with few losses soon after.

During the time between the wars, Suwałki ruled itself. This led to another time of growth, with the number of people in the city rising from 16,780 in 1921 to almost 25,000 in 1935. Most of the money in the city was made from trade during this time. Also, in 1931 the new water works and a power plant were built.
In the later times of the Polish Defensive War of 1939 the town was shortly captured by the Red Army. However, on October 12 of the same year the Soviets quit and gave the area to the Germans, because of the Nazi-Soviet Alliance. The town was named Sudauen and was made a part of the German Reich's East Prussia. Laws and terror led to the making of some rebellion groups. Although most of them were destroyed by the Gestapo, by 1942 the area had one of the strongest ZWZ and AK networks. Almost all of the city's once 7,000-strong Jewish people were murdered in German concentration camps. On October 23, 1944, the city was captured by the Soviet 3rd Belarusian Front. The fights for the city lasted for a few days and killed almost 5,000 Soviet soldiers. 

After the war, Suwałki was still a capital of the powiat. The heavily-damaged town recovered very slowly and Communism did not help the city's problems. This time came to an end in 1975, when Suwałki became the capital of a separate Suwałki Voivodeship. The number of people rose quickly and by the end of the 1970s there were over 36,000 people in the city.

In 1989 the city had a time of trouble. Most of the city's factories did not work good enough and ran out of money. However, the making of the Suwałki Special Economic Zone and the place of the Russian and Lithuanian borders opened new chances for local trade. Also, the clean city started to bring many tourists from all around the world to the city.

Charge (warfare)

A charge is an action in battle in which soldiers advance towards their enemy at their best speed to engage in close combat. The charge has been the key tactic and decisive moment of most battles in history.

The basic process operating in a charge is speed of advance against rate (or effectiveness) of fire. If the attackers advance at a more rapid rate than the defenders can kill or disable them then the attackers will reach the defenders. When a charge was not successful that will often leave the would-be attackers extremely vulnerable to a counter-charge.

Combat

Combat, or fighting, is purposeful violent conflict between two or more persons, groups or organizations, often intended to establish dominance over the opponent. The term "combat" typically means armed conflict between military forces in war. The more general term "fighting" can mean any violent conflict, including boxing and wrestling matches. Combat violence can be unilateral, fighting means that there is at least a defensive reaction. But the terms are often used synonymously.

Interpersonal relationship

Interpersonal relationships are social associations, connections, or affiliations between two or more people. There are different levels of intimacy and sharing concerning centered around something(s) shared in common. The study of relationships is of concern to sociology, psychology and anthropology. 


The discovery or establishment of common ground between individuals is a fundamental component for long lasting interpersonal relationships. Loss of common ground, which may happen over time, may tend to end interpersonal relationships.

For each relationship type, essential skills are needed, and without these skills more advanced relationships are not possible. (For example "partnership" needs the skills of "friendship" and "teamwork" skills).

Intimacy

Intimacy is linked with feelings of closeness among partners in a relationship. It varies from relationship to relationship, and within a given relationship, feelings of closeness may be connected or confused with sexual feelings. In other relationships, intimacy has more to do with shared moments than sexual interactions. 

This is not an exact definition but it seems that intimacy and healthy relationships go hand in hand. Indeed, intimacy is basic in any meaningful relationship: the basis of friendship and one of the foundations of love.

The main forms of intimacy are emotional intimacy and physical intimacy. Intellectual intimacy, familiarity with a person's culture and interests, is common among friends. Members of religious or philosophic groups may also perceive a "spiritual intimacy" in common.

<doc id="46571" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46571" title="Voyager 1">
Voyager 1

The Voyager 1 spacecraft is an 815-kilogram unmanned probe of the outer solar system and beyond, launched September 5, 1977, and is currently operational, making it NASA's longest-lasting mission. It visited Jupiter and Saturn and was the first probe to provide detailed images of the moons of these planets.

"Voyager 1" is the farthest human-made object from Earth, traveling away from both the Earth and the Sun at a relatively faster speed than any other probe. The "New Horizons" mission to Pluto was launched from Earth at a faster speed than "Voyager 1," however since that probe will not get all the gravity assists which sped "Voyager" along its path, it will never pass "Voyager 1".
As of August 12, 2006, "Voyager 1" is over 14.96 terameters (14.96 km, 100 AU or 9.3 billion miles) from the Sun, and has thus entered the heliosheath, the termination shock region between the solar system and interstellar space, a vast area where the Sun's influence gives way to interstellar space. If Voyager 1 is still functioning when it finally passes the heliopause, scientists will get their first direct measurements of the conditions in the interstellar medium. At this distance, signals from "Voyager 1" take more than thirteen hours to reach its control center at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a joint project of NASA and Caltech near Pasadena, California. "Voyager 1" is on a hyperbolic trajectory and has achieved escape velocity, meaning that its orbit will not return to the inner solar system. Along with "Pioneer 10", "Pioneer 11", and its sister ship "Voyager 2", "Voyager 1" is an interstellar probe. 

"Voyager 1" had as its primary targets the planets Jupiter and Saturn and their associated moons and rings; its current mission is the detection of the heliopause and particle measurements of solar wind and the interstellar medium. Both "Voyager" probes are powered by three radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which have far outlasted their originally intended lifespan, and are now expected to continue to generate enough power to keep communicating with Earth until at least around the year 2020.

"Voyager 1" was originally planned as "Mariner 11" of the Mariner program. From the outset, it was designed to take advantage of the then-new technique of gravity assist. By fortunate chance, the development of interplanetary probes coincided with an alignment of the planets called the Grand Tour. The Grand Tour was a linked series of gravity assists that, with only the minimal fuel needed for course corrections, would enable a single probe to visit all four of the solar system's gas giant planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. The identical "Voyager 1" and "Voyager 2" probes were designed with the Grand Tour in mind, and their launches were timed to enable the Grand Tour if desired.

Because of this alignment, Voyager could visit each of these planets in just twelve years, instead of the 30 that would usually be required.

"Voyager 1" was launched on September 5, 1977 by NASA from Cape Canaveral aboard a Titan IIIE Centaur rocket, shortly after its sister craft, "Voyager 2" on August 20, 1977. Despite being launched after "Voyager 2", "Voyager 1" was sent on a faster trajectory so it reached Jupiter and Saturn before its sister craft.

Initially, an underburn in the second stage of the Titan IIIE rocket left an estimated one second's worth of fuel remaining in that stage. Although ground crews were worried that "Voyager 1" would not make it to Jupiter, the Centaur upper stage proved to have enough fuel to compensate.

For details on the "Voyager" instrument packages, see the separate article on the Voyager program.

"Voyager 1" began photographing Jupiter in January 1979. Its closest approach to Jupiter was on March 5, 1979, at a distance of 349,000 kilometers (217,000 miles) from its center. Due to the greater resolution allowed by close approach, most observations of the moons, rings, magnetic fields, and radiation environment of the Jupiter system were made in the 48-hour period bracketing closest approach. It finished photographing the planet in April.

The two "Voyager" spacecraft made a number of important discoveries about Jupiter and its satellites. The most surprising was the existence of volcanic activity on Io, which had not been observed from the ground or by "Pioneer 10" or "11".

The gravity assist at Jupiter was successful, and the spacecraft went on to visit Saturn. "Voyager 1"'s Saturn flyby occurred in November 1980, with the closest approach on November 12 when it came within 124,000 kilometers (77,000 miles) of the planet's cloud-tops. The craft detected complex structures in Saturn's rings, and studied the atmospheres of Saturn and Titan. Because of the earlier discovery of a thick atmosphere on Titan, the "Voyager" controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory elected for "Voyager 1" to make a close approach of Titan and terminate its Grand Tour. (For the continuation of the Grand Tour, see the Uranus and Neptune sections of the "Voyager 2" article.) The Titan-approach trajectory caused an additional gravity assist that took "Voyager 1" out of the plane of the ecliptic, thus ending its planetary science mission.

It is estimated both "Voyager" craft would have sufficient electrical power to operate at least some instruments until 2020.
Both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 include the Voyager Golden Record, which is a recording of sounds and images of life on earth. It was designed by a team headed by Carl Sagan to communicate with extraterrestrial life.
As the Voyager 1 space probe heads for interstellar space, its instruments continue to study the solar system; Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists are using the plasma wave experiments aboard "Voyager 1" and "2" to look for the heliopause. 

Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab believe that "Voyager" entered the termination shock in February 2003. Some other scientists have expressed doubt, discussed in the journal "Nature" of November 6 2003. In a scientific session at the American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans on the morning of March 25 2005, Dr. Ed Stone presented evidence that "Voyager 1" crossed the termination shock in December 2004 . The issue will not be resolved for some months as other data become available, since "Voyager"'s solar-wind detector ceased functioning in 1990. However, in May 2005 a NASA press release said that consensus was that "Voyager 1" was now in the heliosheath. Scientists believe the craft will reach the heliopause in 2015.

As of August 12, 2006 at 21:13 UTC (or 07:21:32 UTC without light-time correction), "Voyager 1" was at a distance of 100 AU (approximately 14.96 terameters, 9.3 billion miles or 0.002 light years from the Sun), which makes it the most distant human-made object from Earth. At this distance, it is more distant from the Sun than any known natural solar-system object, including 90377 Sedna. Though Sedna has an orbit that takes it 975 AU away from the Sun at apihelion, as of 2006 it is less than 90 AU away from the Sun and approaching its perihelion at 76 AU.

At its current distance, light (which travels at 300,000 kilometers per second) takes over 13.8 hours to reach the spacecraft from Earth. As a basis for comparison, the Moon is about 1.4 light seconds from Earth, the Sun is about 8.5 light minutes away, and Pluto is at an average distance of approximately 5.5 light hours. As of November 2005, the spacecraft was travelling at a speed of 17.2 kilometers per second relative to the sun (3.6 AU per year or 38,400 miles per hour), 10% faster than Voyager 2. Accurate information concerning its location can be found in this NASA paper with heliocentric coordinates extrapolated up to 2015 of both probes. It is not heading towards any particular star, but in 40,000 years it will be within 1.7 light years of the star AC+793888 in the Camelopardis constellation.

"Voyager 1", as of September 2006, is at 12.22° declination and 17.051hrs Right Ascension, placing it in the constellation Ophiuchus.

NASA continues daily tracking of Voyager 1 with the Deep Space Network stations.

On 31 March 2006, the amateur radio operators from AMSAT Germany tracked and received data from Voyager 1 using the 20 m dish at Bochum with a long integration technique. Its data were checked and verified against data from the Deep Space Network station at Madrid, Spain. AMSAT-DL article in German; ARRL article in English. This is believed to be the first such tracking of Voyager.

Firework

A firework is an explosive pyrotechnic device that is used mostly for entertainment. The most common use of a firework is as part of a fireworks display.

Fireworks (devices) are made to have these four effects: They make noise, light, smoke, and sometimes produce floating materials (confetti for example). They may be designed to burn with colored flames and sparks. Displays are common throughout the world and are a main point of many different cultural and religious . Independence Day and New Year's Eve are examples.

Fireworks were invented in China over 800 years ago. Some fireworks are ground-based, and others are shot into the air. Because they explode and can cause fires or burns, most countries have laws that only allow trained professionals to use display fireworks. Smaller, less explosive fireworks are available to regular, everyday people, but they are still dangerous and cause injuries each year.

Fireworks dates back to the 7th century and originated in China. The Chinese developed many different kinds of fireworks with a variety of effects and color. The art and science of firework making developed into an independent profession. In China, pyrotechnicians were respected for their knowledge of complex techniques in mounting firework displays.

During the Song Dynasty (960-1279), many of the common people could purchase various kinds of fireworks from market vendors, and grand displays of fireworks were also known to be held. In 1110, a large fireworks display in a martial demonstration was held to entertain Emperor Huizong of Song (r. 1100-1125) and his court.</ref> A record from 1264 states that a rocket-propelled firework went off near the Empress Dowager Gong Sheng and startled her during a feast held in her honor by her son Emperor Lizong of Song (r. 1224–1264). 

Rocket propulsion was common in warfare, as evidenced by the "Huolongjing" compiled by Liu Ji (1311–1375) and Jiao Yu (fl. c. 1350–1412). In 1240 the Arabs acquired knowledge of gunpowder and its uses from China. A Syrian named Hasan al-Rammah wrote of rockets, fireworks, and other incendiaries, using terms that suggested he derived his knowledge from Chinese sources, such as his references to fireworks as "Chinese flowers".

Pyrotechnics is often thought to be synonymous with the manufacture of fireworks, but it includes also items for military and industrial uses. 

Items such as safety matches, oxygen candles, explosive bolts and fasteners and the automobile safety airbag all fall under pyrotechnics. Without pyrotechnics, modern aviation and spaceflight would be impracticable.

This is because pyrotechnic devices combine high reliabilty with very compact and efficient energy storage.

R.C. Recreativo de Huelva

Real Club Recreativo de Huelva is a Spanish football club. The club was starting in 1889. It is the oldest football team in Spain.

Real Club Recreativo de Huelva is a Spanish football team formed on December 23 1889. This makes it the oldest football team in Spain, formed by Dr McKay and overseas British workers at the Rio Tinto mines. Originally named "Huelva Recreation Club". Due to its long-standing existence (it is the oldest surviving team of Spanish professional soccer), the team is often referred to as "El Decano" ("the dean") of the Spanish football fraternity.

Commonly known as "Recre", they play in white with blue vertical stripes and white shorts. Their home ground is the Nuevo Colombino stadium that seats 19,860.

After three seasons in "Segunda División" (Spanish second division), "Recre" achieved promotion to top flight after beating Numancia Soria on June 4, 2006, mathematically securing promotion with two matches left to be played. "El Decano" is again among the elite of Spanish football for the 2006/07 season.



Only three non-EU nationals can be on the pitch at anytime. Those with European ancestry can claim a passport from the nation their ancestors came from. If a player does not have European ancestry he can claim a Spanish passport by playing in Spain for 3 years.

Yu-Gi-Oh! (first series anime)

Yu-Gi-Oh! is the title of the first anime series based on the "Yu-Gi-Oh!" manga. It is not connected in any way to the "Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters" series (known internationally as simply Yu-Gi-Oh!). They are 2 different anime series that are based on the same manga series. Fans of Yu-Gi-Oh! use the fan name "Yu-Gi-Oh! A Shadow Game" when talking about this show. They may use "Yu-Gi-Oh! first season" or "zero season" to refer to this show but this is not correct.

The series aired on television from April 4, 1998 to October 10, 1998. It has 27 episodes. It was produced by Toei Animation. The level of violence was reduced between the manga and the anime. Some characters and how the characters acted were changed from the manga and new characters and plots were added and Duel Monsters had a bigger part. Unlike the second series, the card game (Duel Monsters) is not the main part of the show.

Social Democratic Party of Germany

The Social Democratic Party of Germany (German or SPD) is the oldest political party of Germany that still exists. There were other political parties that were older, but they no longer exist.

It was founded as the General German Workers Association ("Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein") (ADAV) on May 23rd in 1863 in Leipzig. Founder was Ferdinand Lassalle.
In 1875 the ADAV joined with the Social Democratic Workers' Party ("Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei") (SDAP), which was founded in 1869 in Eisenach by August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht.

The new name was the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany ("Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands") (SAP).

In the autumn of 1890 it took its present name.

In the years between 1875 and 1890 it was made illegal by Otto von Bismarck.
The Social democrats wanted to support the rights of workers.

In 1914 the SPD was split into two. Most members of the party supported the Kaiser and his plans for war. The other members formed the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany ("Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschland") (USPD). They were against the war.

After the monarchy fell, the SPD lead some governments of the Weimar Republic.

Later the SPD was the only party in the Reichstag who voted against the Enabling Act,("Ermächtigungsgesetz") which allowed Hitler to become dictator.

Afterwards, the Nazis banned the SPD. They arrested the leading social democrats. Many were sent to Nazi concentration camps. Others moved away to towns where they were not known. Friedrich Kellner, an organizer for the SPD in Mainz from 1920 to 1932, moved to Laubach. He wrote entries in a secret diary about the crimes of the Nazis.

After World War II, the SPD was reformed.
In the GDR (East Germany) the Soviet Union forced the SPD to join with the communist party to make the Socialist Unity Party of Germany ("Sozialistische Einheitspartei"). In Western Germany the SPD worked as a not-communist left-winged party.

First chief of the SPD after WWII was Kurt Schumacher.

The SPD lead some state governments in West Germany, but was always the leading opposition party in the Bundestag (federal parliament).
Under its parliamentary party leader Herbert Wehner the SPD joined the federal government lead by chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger (CDU) with the CDU and the CSU in 1966. Party chief Willy Brandt became foreign secretary and vice chancellor.

In 1969 Willy Brandt became federal chancellor. The SPD lead a coalition government with the FDP as its partner. In 1974 Helmut Schmidt became chancellor.

In 1982 the SPD lost the power of government.

Between 1998 and 2005 the SPD lead the government under chancellor Gerhard Schröder. Its partner this time was the Green Party.

In November 2005 the SPD became the junior partner in a coalition with the CDU and CSU under Angela Merkel.

The SPD is traditionally the party of the workers in Germany.
In 1959 the SPD adopted the "Godesberger Programm", named after the town of Bad Godesburg in North Rhine-Westphalia. The SPD formally abandoned Marxism, and accepted the market economy (which means people and companies can make money and keep it themselves), but wanted to have a social balance (which means people would get help from the government if they had no job, were sick or too old to work, instead of relying on savings or charity). Companies might get subsidies to help keep people in work.

Many people thought that the government of Chancellor Schröder (1998 - 2005) changed the idea of social balance, making people rely more on savings or charity. The SPD lost a lot of members. Now there is a discussion in the SPD about new social balance policies.

<doc id="46647" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46647" title="Pension">
Pension

A pension is a steady income given to someone. If pensions are part of a system of social security, the recipient of the pension is usually retired or disabled. They either have worked a long time during their life, or they are physically unable to do so. A pension is usually paid until a certain date (or event) occurs. In the case of social security plans, pensions are usually linked to the life of the person who receives the pension. 

Some pensions define the benefit to the worker based on salary basis, years worked, and a multiplier. An example might be 2@55 final 3, meaning that the annuity is the highest 3-year average salary times years worked times 2% (if age 55). A worker with 30 years service would receive 2*30 or 60% of their salary. Some systems allow a worker to receive more than 100% salary by various maneuvers to alter the final salary basis.

This system defines the contribution, without constraining or promising a certain benefit. For example, a company might contribute 10% of a worker's salary to a pension account of the worker's choice, with final benefit received linked to the performance of the investment chosen. 

Many pension systems are underfunded and likely unsustainable based on independent financial analysis. Pension reform is a popular topic since about 2009, with pension debt seen as a contributing factor in the deficits at all levels of government.

Role

A role (sometimes spelled rôle) or a social role can be described as an expected behaviour of an individual. 

More precisely one could say it is a set of connected behaviours, rights and obligations that a person has to follow in a social situation. It depends on social status and social position.

"Role confusion" is a situation where an individual has trouble to decide which role he/she should play. For example, one could be a college student who would attend a meeting of a particular recreational interest and find his or her teacher there. He would be in conflict between behaving as a student and as an enthusiast who shares the same interest as the teacher.

Aeneas

Aeneas was a Trojan prince and hero. His father was Anchises, his mother was the Greek goddess Aphrodite (Venus in the case of Roman sources). Both Homer and Vergil mention him in their stories. Vergil wrote a whole series of books about him. These books are called Aeneis in their original Latin. The usual English translation of the title is "Aeneid". 

The books are the story of ""pious Aeneas". and about how the city of Rome came to be. 

The tale starts with Aeneas carrying his father out of the burning Troy, and end with Romulus and Remus founding Rome (after Aeneas landed on the coast, after sailing the Mediterranean Sea for a long time). Aeneas also appears in Book 5 of the "Iliad" written by Homer.

William Shakespeare also wrote a story mentioning Aeneas. Christopher Marlowe wrote a play about Aeneas and Dido, the queen who fell in love with him. There is also an opera about Dido and Aeneas, written by Henry Purcell.

Hasidic Judaism

Hasidic Judaism is a Jewish religious movement that was started by Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer, the Baal Shem Tov. It began in Eastern Europe and there are now Hasidic communities all over the world. The followers of Hasidism are called Hasidim. 

Hasidism teaches about the importance of serving God with happiness. While Hasidim study the same books of Torah as the rest of Judaism, they focus on learning the hidden aspects of the text as well. Hasidic study also includes many of the teachings of Kabbalah.

Each Hasidic group has a leader who is called the Rebbe. The Rebbe is a man who is a Rabbi and is chosen by the hasidim to be their leader. Some of the jobs that he does are giving lectures on Torah and Chassidut and taking part in the different events of his Hasidim, like weddings and bris milahs.

There are hundreds of different Hasidic groups. They all share similar characteristics but they also have individual customs. Some of the larger dynasties are Satmar, Chabad-Lubavitch, Bobov, Viznitz, and Belz.

Lissa Explains it All

Lissa Explains it All is a website. It teaches beginners and kids HTML as well as other things like JavaScript to help them make a website. It was made by Alyssa "Lissa" Daniels" (born 1986) in 1998.

Lissa did not plan on teaching HTML at first. She was an 11 year old girl who wanted to make a website but had problems remembering the HTML codes. She saved the codes on a webpage. Many people who saw her website asked her how she made it. Lissa gave them the address (URL) to the webpage she put the codes on. As more and more people went on the page, Lissa added more codes and information, and made the URL it became public.

A year later, so many people went on Lissa Explains that Lissa decided she needed a domain name for her website. She bought the domain name, lissaexplains.com. The website name was changed to Lissa Explains it All. Soon, even more people went on Lissa Explains, and her web hosters told Lissa that she would have to buy a plan that costed $100 a month. Lissa was upset because her parents would not pay so much money for her website.

Lissa Explains was a popular website that had a lot of visitors, so Lissa filled out many forms at agencies. The agency would pay her money to put their advertisements on her website, Lissa Explains. The money she made paid for her web hosting and other services on her website. The company that hosts Lissa Explains now is Dreamhost.

Now, with even more visitors, Lissa had to change the layout and design of her website again. She got rid of a lot of the pictures on her website to save money and bandwidth space. It changed from this to this, the way it looks right now.

Lissa's website was the first website that taught children HTML. Many people know about it, and it is being copied. For example, Lissaexplainsitall.comhas a URL that is almost the same as Lissa Explains, and it also has something to do with web design and HTML.

Other than teaching HTML, Lissa Explains also has other services. Lissa teaches HTML, JavaScript, CSS, how to use frames and tables, and how to make a trailing cursor.
In April 2008 the website for LissaMail expired, leading to the conclusion that this service is no longer being provided.
Lissa has postcards that users can send to their friends. 
Lissa's Color Slider lets users choose a color in the shade they want and get the hexadecimal color code for it. She also has a color wheel for people who have Internet Explorer. 
Lissa's HTML Editor converts and changes formatted text into HTML codes.

At Lissa's Meta Tag generator, users can get the HTML code to make META tags.

Bunk bed

A bunk bed is a stack of two or more beds. Metal poles or wooden beams connect the bottom bed (called the bottom bunk) to the top bed (called the top bunk). A ladder is used to get up to the top bunk. The ladder is usually attached to the bed. In the Philippines, a bunk bed is called a double deck.

Bunk beds are often used in children's rooms. Since bunk beds allow a family to put two beds in the space of a single bed, bunk beds save space. Bunk beds help families with small apartments or houses to have enough beds for their children.

Bunk beds are often used in institutions such as prisons. As well, they are often used in public facilities such as homeless shelters and bomb shelters. Bunk beds are also used in firehalls, to give firefighters a place to sleep. Many military organizations use bunk beds. Navy ships and submarines use bunk beds for the sailors to sleep in. Army barracks sometimes have bunk beds for soldiers.

Summer camps and winter cabins for children (such as boy scouts or girl scouts) often have bunk beds. Hostels, a type of inexpensive hotel for travelers, often have bunk beds. Some ski lodges have bunk beds in their rooms.

The earthquake affected southern Chile, Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, and the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. 

Its epicenter was Valdivia, Chile. The earthquake caused tsunamis that pounded the Chilean coastline with waves of up to 25 meters. The main tsunami raced across the Pacific Ocean and caused great damage to Hilo, Hawaii. Waves as high as 10.7 meters (about 35 feet) were recorded 10,000 kilometers from where the earthquake started. These waves travelled as far as Japan and the Philippines.

The total number of deaths from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami was believed to be 6,000. The damage was estimated at over half a billion dollars.

He is most famous for his resignation in the fall of 1973 after he was under investigation for the crimes of extortion, tax fraud, bribery, and conspiracy. In October he was charged with having taken bribes a little more than $100,000 while in office.

Agnew is the only U.S. Vice President in history to leave office because of criminal charges. Ten years later, in January 1983, he paid the state of Maryland almost $270,000 as a result of a civil suit that came from the bribery allegations.

Spiro Agnew was born in the state of Maryland to Theodore Spiros Agnew, a Greek immigrant who shortened his name from Anagnostopoulos when he moved to the USA, and Margaret Akers, a native of Virginia.

His 1872 Erlangen Program, which classified geometries by their underlying symmetry groups, was a hugely influential synthesis of much of the mathematics of the day.

The Klein bottle is named after him.

Land (economics)

In economics, land means all natural resources that cannot be produced in a larger quantity if prices go up, such as geographical locations and mineral deposits. 

In classical economics it is considered one of three factors of production, the other two being capital and labor; income that one gets because of ownership or control of natural resources is often referred to as rent.

Part (music)

In music, a part is a line of music which is played by one player or group of players (or sung by one or more singers). This is the usual meaning of the word “part” when talking about musical compositions. 

When a group of instruments are all playing the same notes together - like the first violins in an orchestra, they are all playing the same part. The second violins are playing another part, the violas are playing yet another part, etc.

In a string quartet each of the four instruments plays a different part.

A group of singers who are all singing the tune together are singing in "unison". If they divide into soprano, alto, tenor and bass, they are singing in four parts. The sopranos may be singing the tune and the altos, tenors and basses are providing the harmony underneath. This is called “4 part harmony”. If each of the four parts has its own share of the melody (or its own melody) it is polyphonic music. Polyphonic music is always in several parts.

Sometimes music for the piano or organ may be written in a strict number of parts, e.g. a 5 part fugue for the piano could also be performed on five different instruments because there are always exactly five different lines of music (although sometimes a part will have a rest, but this is always shown by rests in the music). Although written on two staves for the pianist (or three staves for an organist) it could be written on five staves: one stave for each part.

Another word for a musical "part" is "voice". In most other European languages the word for "part" in this musical sense is the same as the normal word for "voice" e.g. in German: "Stimme" or French "voix".

In general, the more parts there are in a musical composition the harder it is to compose because they all have to fit together to sound nice. The 16th century composer Thomas Tallis wrote a motet called "Spem in alium" which is in 40 parts. A choir of at least 40 people is needed to sing it, and even then each person will be singing something different to all the others.

A slightly different (but related) meaning of “part” can be the actual printed music that a player in an orchestra or band puts on the music stand to play from. The oboe part, for example, will just have the notes that the oboe plays. In contrast, the conductor has a musical score in which all the instrumental parts are written underneath one another.

The word "part" can also be used in its normal meaning of "section" (i.e. a bit of something). We can say: “the first part of the movement is played just by the woodwind instruments”. 

Sometimes a large work like an oratorio will be split into two or three “Parts” (in opera these would be called “Acts”).

Videocassette recorder

Videocassette recorder (VCR) is an electronic device that plays VHS or Beta tapes that contain recordings of movies and other programs (such as music videos, exercise videos, and so on). To watch a recording using a VCR, the VCR has to be connected to a television set. 

In the mid-1980s, VCRs became a very popular way for people to watch movies and other recorded programs on their home television. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, video rental stores offered a large selection of movies recorded on VHS tapes that customers could rent. In the 1980s, some video rental stores also offered a smaller number of movies recorded on Beta tapes that customers could rent.

VCRs are also used to record programs from television broadcasts. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, many people used VCRs to record their favorite television shows.

In the late 1990s and throughout the 2000s, the DVD player replaced the VCR as the most common way to watch movies on a home television. The VCR sales dropped later, causing the VCR to be used less by people.

Labour (economics)

In classical economics and all microeconomics labour (or labor) is a measure of the work done by human beings and is one of three factors of production, the others being land and capital. There are macroeconomic system theories which have created a concept called human capital (referring to the skills that workers possess, not necessarily their actual work), although there are also theories that think human capital is a contradiction in terms.

Wage is a basic compensation for labour.

Widescreen

Widescreen is a video format often used in movies. It is also becoming very popular for television and other things like Computer monitors.
Widescreen is often used as it let more of an image to be seen on the screen.

Widescreen is often used as a nickname for the 16:9 aspect ratio of television screens. This means that if the television screen was sixteen inches wide it would have to be nine inches tall. A "regular" television's screen would be 4:3 which means if it was four inches wide it would have to be three inches tall. In adition to these small screens, a screen could be any size with the same ratio. For example, a screen could be 32 inches wide and 18 inches tall and still be considered widescreen.

Song Dynasty

The Song Dynasty ruled in China from 960–1279. It started the reunification of China for the first time since the fall of the Tang Dynasty in 907. The years in between, known as the Period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms, were a time of division between north and south, and of rapidly changing administrations. In 960, a general of the Later Zhou dynasty named Zhao Kuangyin (the later Emperor Taizu of Song) overthrew the emperor through a mutiny and established the Song dynasty. Although it unified China, its army was weak and defeated in the wars against the Liao dynasty and Western Xia. Soon after the death of Emperor Taizu, the empire faced many problems in economy and military. In 1127, the Manchu clans led by the Jin Dynasty emperors destroyed the Liao Dynasty, invaded Song, and captured the emperor, princes, and ministers. A prince at southern China was lucky to be the only one who was not taken by the Manchus, and after the invasion of northern China he succeeded the throne at Hangzhou. Because of this, historians named the Song that was before the invasion named Northern Song, and the one after the invasion named Southern Song. Southern Song made peace with the Manchus and existed until Kublai Khan of the Mongols invaded the entire southern China in 1279.

<doc id="46790" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46790" title="Bipolar affective disorder">
Bipolar affective disorder

Bipolar Disorder is a term from psychiatry. It was called manic depression because people who have this illness are sometimes manic and at other times have depression. It is a kind of mental illness.

Sometimes, a person can experience something called mania. Mania is when a person's brain goes into a high-energy state. The other extreme is a low-energy state that is depression. "Bipolar" literally means "two poles" or two extremes in how much energy the brain has. When in a high-energy state, mania can cause extreme emotions such as panic attacks or extreme happiness such as euphoria.

When a person with Bipolar Disorder is manic, they might not think as hard about the choices that they make, and sometimes may do things like give things to people, or spend lots of money. This is because during a manic episode, a lot of people start to believe things that are not really true, or get confused about what's real and what's made up. People can also become aggressive and possibly violent while manic, but this only happens in very, very bad cases, so it's not as common as some people think.

There are a few things that a lot of people start to believe when they have manic episodes. Sometimes, they might think they have lots and lots of money, when they really do not. Other times, the person who has a manic episode might think that people they knew are alive, even though the truth is that these people have died. Every person is different, so it's important to remember that these things do not happen to all people with Bipolar Disorder.

Like most mental illnesses, there are ways to treat Bipolar Disorder. Sometimes taking medicine or getting therapy can make it easier to control. The same treatments and medicines do not work for everyone, and it is not rare for people to have manic episodes when they stop taking their medicine because they feel like they can control their disorder. Things like this can make Bipolar Disorder a difficult illness to live with, but when people are educated about it, it is not quite as hard.

Bipolar Disorder used to be called Manic Depression. This was because the two symptoms were mania and depression. Now psychiatrists and psychotherapists (doctors who specialize in mental illnesses) think bipolar disorder is one illness in its own right, not a combination of two other illnesses, and have developed new treatments and "coping "strategies"" (plans to live more easily with bipolar disorder)

The Left Party.PDS (in German: Die Linkspartei or Linkspartei.PDS) was a left-winged political party in Germany. After joining with another political party, it became "Die Linke", or "The Left" in 2007.

After the end of the GDR in 1990, the former Socialist Unity Party of Germany "Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands" (SED) changed to the SED-PDS and later to the Partei des Demokratischen Sozialismus (PDS).
In the former GDR it was very successful in state elections and it had a small group in the federal parliament. But it always failed in Western Germany.

In the 2000s there were a lot of changes of job policy and ways of helping people in need. People that restrictions hurt the poorer and unemployed people in Germany. These reforms were made by the Social democrats SPD and the Greens, who were traditionally the left-wing parties in Germany.

Some people, who left the SPD and some people from Trade Unions founded the Electors Association for Work and Social Justice "Wahlgemeinschaft Arbeit und Soziale Gerechtigkeit" (WASG) in Western Germany. Many students.
They - and although the PDS - realized that there was no chance to win mandates in elections as concurrents. So they decided to found a new party, Die Linkspartei.

In the last federal elections the joined the parliament, in the state of Berlin they joined the state government.

Die Linkspartei is a left-wing party. It is the only party in the federal parliament, which believes in the need for government rules protecting jobs and people instead of letting do everything they want.

They want to have more people employed in by government bodies instead of having private companies doing jobs for the government. They also want higher taxes the rich and those who make money from the capital marked instead of work.

They are against study fees and want to have only a Comprehensive school "gesamtschule" instead of two or three different types of further school in most German states.

Their foreign policy follows the old position of the Green Party "Bündnis 90/Die Grüne" and is strictly against any German soldiers fighting. They are still talking about allowing German soldiers to be in the peace keeping missions of the United Nations.
In the field of civil rights they copied the position of the Greens, too.

Laptop

A laptop is a computer which is easy to carry around. Its user can fold the laptop up and be able to take it with him/her. The laptop was created mainly for this particular reason. In order to develop a laptop a computer technology was taken and then scaled to smaller size.

The first laptop was invented in 1969 by Bill Moggridge. The British developed his portable computer for GRiD Systems Corporation. GRiD made the product with a fold-down display that covered the keyboard. GRiD started manufacturing in 1979 with commercial distribution occurring in 1981.

GRiD's computer was five times lighter than any other computer used at that time. NASA used the laptop when it performed its shuttle program, back in the 1980s. GRiD held patents for the Clamshell design which represents our modern laptop design. GRiD was acquired in 1988 by Tandy Corporation who after acquisition monetized the Clamshell Patent by aggressively pursuing all computer manufacturers who were selling clamshell design laptops. GRiD also had patents for handheld and handwriting computers which Tandy holds to this day.

Historians, however, consider that the first portable was created in 1981 and its name was Osborne 1. Its inventor was Adam Osborne who was also a former book publisher. He was the founder of Osborne Computer. His portable computer weighed 24 pounds. 

The company spent 1,795 US dollars on creating the computer, which had a five-inch screen and a special place for a modem and two devices for using a floppy disk. There were also several programs designed for the computer and a battery pack for providing energy. The computer, however, was not successful. 

The same year saw the birth of another computer called Epson HX-20. It was a portable computer with a liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor. The computer also included a built-in printer. The whole device was battery powered. 

One year later, in 1982, two computer designers from Microsoft, Kazuhiko Nishi and Bill Gates, started their discussion concerning a new portable computer. The main thing about the computer was a new LCD technology. The prototype of the new laptop was presented to Radio Shack. 

The latter agreed to start the production of the computer. A year later the company launched its TRS-80 Model 100, which was a computer that looked pretty much like a laptop we know it today.

In 1986 the company created its improved version called TRS Model 200. The following two years saw the appearance of a laptop PC from Compaq Computers and the first notebook-style laptop from NEC called NEC UltraLite.

The year 1989 was quite successful for laptop producers. First there was Apple Computer that developed its first portable computer called Macintosh Portable the evolution of which turned it into PowerBook. Then the company named Zenith Data Systems introduced its Zenith MinisPort – a portable computer weighing 6 pounds. Finally there was Compaq Computer that designed its first laptop PC called Compaq LTE.

The development of laptops continued with various upgrades and additional functions added. Laptops have a lot of advantages like: 


At the same time portable computers have several negative points like:

InuYasha

Inuyasha is a manga made by Rumiko Takahashi that has also been made an anime series. 

This is a story started by a girl shooting a boy who has dog ears and white hair. She shouts "Inuyasha!" to him, while she shoots and dies afterwards, nobody knows why. Her little sister, Kaede, runs to her side calling "Sister Kikyo!" , but it's too late. She's already dead. Before Kikyo dies though, she asks Kaede to burn her together with a purple jewel - the Shikon no Tama (The Shikon Jewel). 
But, Kikyo's not dead yet, because of her reincarnation, meaning Kikyo became alive again to another person, who is a girl called Kagome. She soon appears after Kikyo burns, in the future world, and her granpa shows a fake shikon no tama which Kagome does not believe in. She never believed in those things until... her 15th birthday arrived. She lands into a well in her house, where she goes back to the past, finding Inuyasha on a tree, stuck on there for 50 years by Kikyo's arrow. 

She meets Kaede, an older one because 50 years passed in this world after what happened to Kikyo. Kaede finds out that Kagome is the reincarnation of her own sister, and helps her keep the real shikon no tama that Kagome suddenly found in her body. Kagome gets the arrow out of Inuyasha when a centipede yokai/demon attacked her to get the jewel. When Inuyasha does kill it, he tries to kill Kagome too, to revenge on Kikyo (he thought Kagome was her), but Kagome can now control him with Kaede's magic by saying "sit!" just like a dog. And Inuyasha "is" a dog yokai! After that, Kagome shatters the jewel by mistake and has to try to find them all before evil creatures do. This is the beginning of their adventure and they also have to find one of the evil, who is Naraku. Many other characters come to help Kagome and Inuyasha, like Sango, Miroku, Kirara and Shippo... this, in the anime finished at 167 episodes but many people expect it to continue... inuyasha is like a basic fairy tale.

The Shikon no Tama (English:The Jewel of Four Souls) is the fictional magic jewel in the anime and manga series InuYasha. It is called the Jewel of Four Souls because it has four souls of 4 different names: Aramitama (Courage), Nigimitama (Friendship), Kushimitama (Wisdom) and Sakimitama (Love). The souls can make a person very powerful.

When Midoriko was about to die fighting a demon, she joined her 4 soul inside her heart, with the soul of the demon to make it good and pure. By doing that, she killed herself and the demon. This created the Shikon jewel. Inside it, Midoriko and the demon souls still fought each other. This battle is depends to the person who has the jewel. The jewel can become pure (become good because Midoriko is winning) or impure (become bad because the demon is winning). Many creatures want the jewel because it can make them powerful like Midoriko. They can do anything they want with it. If someone wants to become a full demon then they will become that, just like Naraku wants to. 

After many fights of different demons and humans, Shako, Sango's grandpa found the jewel from a demon called Mistress Centipede. The jewel was impure because it had been with the evil Mistress Centipede. He took the jewel to Kikyo. Only the goodness of Kikyo's priestess power could purify it and make it good. But when Kikyo is burnt because she dies by Naraku wanting the jewel and killing her, and she wants the jewel to burn and destroy along with her. Kagome, Kikyo's reincarnation gets the jewel even so, and when Mistress Centipede's bones inside the well become alive with the jewel's power when Kagome comes near, she is dragged into the well and the past where everything happened. Kagome shatters the jewel by accident when she shoots a crow which swallowed it, and has to find all the pieces before evil creatures do with Inuyasha. 

Some people tried to make shikon no tama themselves so that they can have its power without trying to find all the pieces. Izumo, a half-demon who turns to a demon at night, but a human at day, is a clever philosopher who likes nature and the world. He is the one who knows how to make a shikon no tama, and a frog-demon with some other demons grab him so that they can start making a fake shikon no tama. Izumo agrees and makes many copies of shikon no tamas which only has small power. He said to the frog-demon that to make the copies like the real one, they had to collect the souls of people with Aramitama (Courage), Nigimitama (Friendship), Kushimitama (Wisdom) and Sakimitama (Love). When Inuyasha and his friends come to save Izumo who plans to get them because of his friends having the souls that he needed to make a real shikon no tama. 

Inuyasha, Kagome, Miroku, Sango, Shippo, and Sesshomaru finally finish off Naraku and the shikon jewel disappears
-Miroku and Sango have three kids together
-Kagome is thrown back into her own time for three years and comes back to the feudal era after she finishes off high school.
Kikyo was killed by Naraku.
-Inuyasha and Kagome are married after being reunited after the three-year separation and Sesshomaru leaves Rin at Kaede's villages so that she can be used to being surrounded by humans and once a while, Sesshomaru visits Rin and gives her presents.

Kurt Schumacher

Dr. Kurt Schumacher (born 13 October 1895 in Kulm, West Prussia (now Chełmno in Poland) - died 20 August 1952 in Bonn) was a German politician. He was leader of the SPD from 1946 to 1952 and speaker of the SPD in the Bundestag 1949-1952.

Schumacher was born as the son of a salesman. When World War I started, he left school to join the German army. In December 1914, he was badly hurt. His arm had to be removed. After this, he went back to school in Berlin to study Law and politics. While there, he became a socialist. In 1924, he was elected to the legislature in Württemberg. He became the SPD leader for Württemberg in 1928. In 1930, he was elected to the national legislature, the Reichstag.

After the Nazis took control of Germany, Schumacher was arrested. He was beaten badly in prison. He was put into concentration camps for the next ten years. In 1943, Schumacher was set free because of his bad health. He was arrested again in 1944 and stayed in the concentration camps until the British set them free in April 1945.

After the World War II, Schumacher put the SPD back together. He was first chief of the Social democrats in West Germany after the WWII. He was also their first speaker in the federal parliament (Bundestag) and first leader of opposition in the Bundestag.

In 1952, Schumacher died in Bonn.

Similar liberal parties were founded in other German states, most of them successful in getting mandates.
In 1947, on March 17th, the "Demokratische Partei Deutschlands" (DPD) was founded as a whole-Germany liberal party by Theodor Heuss and Wilhelm Külz, but it broke down after a short while.
On December, 11th in 1948 the FDP was founded as a liberal party for West Germany.
Chief of the party was Theodor Heuss. The next important man was Thomas Dehler.

In its first years the main part of the party followed a national-liberal way. Liberal in the economical field, but very conserative in most other fields.
But in every state it had its own way.
The FDP was the smaller partner of the CDU under Konrad Adenauer. It was member of the West German government from 1949 to 1966.

In 1969 the FDP returned to government. But now the FDP was partner of the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands under Willy Brandt, later Helmut Schmidt.
The party changed its values. Left-liberal positions were the leading ideas of the FDP at that time and included ideas like
civil rights and giving everyone the chance for a good education (guaranteed state stipendia, no more study fees, more higher education schools).

It changed again in 1982, when the government crashed on Schmidt and elected Helmut Kohl of the CDU as the new chancellor.
It became more and more a single issue party with its only interest in a low tax tarif - especally for high incomes.
It fought for study fees now and against social security. It secretary general said one day "We are the party of the best-incomes".

In 1998 it lost its power and became part of the opposition.
In some state parliaments the FDP is still in power as junior partner of the CDU.

The party's unofficial motto is "So viel Staat wie nötig, so wenig Staat wie möglich!", meaning "as much state as necessary, as little state as possible!"

Alliance '90/The Greens

Alliance '90/The Greens (German: Bündnis 90/Die Grünen) is a political party in Germany. It was formed in 1992 by the Western German party "Die Grünen" and the Eastern German "Bündnis '90". Its main interests are ecology, civil rights, equality between men and women and the chances of immigrants in the German society. Their motto is "now, for tomorrow".

In the 1970s, there were a lot of protests against nuclear power in Germany. The protesters had no support in the political parties in Germany. So they got the idea to found their own party.

In the election to the European Parliament of 1979, their party, the Sonstige Politische Vereinigung Die Grünen, got 3,2 %. They tried again and this time it was accepted and was founded in Karlsruhe on January 13th, 1980.

Since their aims were for civil rights and ecology, a lot of former Anti Vietnam War protesters joined the party.
The Greens were pacifists and strictly against nuclear weapons. They wanted to reach a de-militarized Europe.

First chiefs of the party were Herbert Gruhl and Petra Kelly. After a short while some right-winged people left the party, so they became a left-winged party.

In the old GDR, a Green party was founded in 1989 and joined to the Western Greens in 1990. In 1993 the Bündnis 90 - a civil rights movement from the former GDR - and Die Grünen joined them.

In 1998 they joined the federal government under Gerhard Schröder together with the Social democrats.

The Green lost a lot of their values in that time. They voted for joining the Kosovo War and to attack Serbia in 1999 and lost their social issues. In 2005 they lost their power in the federal government.
Currently they are in opposition in the federal and all state parliaments.

The Greens are interested in ecology, so one of their main issues is saving the earth - especially the climate - without using nuclear power.

The second main issue of the Greens is gender mainstraming.

The third issue are the integration and the chances of immigrants in Germany.

In the foreign policy the Green changed their position in their first period in federal government. Before that time they wanted German soldiers only to allow peace keeping missions of the United Nations, many Greens wanted a de-militarized Germany. After their legislative period - with main influence of foreign secretary Fischer - they accepted to join international military missions e.g. in Afganisthan. But their main issue is to avoid conflicts by development policy and international cooperation. Main issues of foreign policy are international envoirementional and climate saving projects like the Kyoto protocoll, the development of the European Union and a reform of the international law like the installing of the International Crime Court in The Hague.

They are left-winged liberals.

Christian Social Union of Bavaria

The Christian Social Union of Bavaria or Christlich Soziale Union (short CSU) is a conservative political party in the German state of Bavaria.
In the federal parliament of Germany (Bundestag) the CSU and the CDU, which the main center right political party of Germany, always join together.

Its chief is Horst Lorenz Seehofer.

In 1945, two local CSU groups were founded. One in Würzburg and the other in Munich.

In January 1946 the CSU was founded for the whole of Bavaria.

All state elections of Bavaria were won by the CSU. Sometimes the CSU had to make some coalitions with the Bayernpartei (Bavarian Party), the FDP or the SPD.

In the federal government the CSU always joins with the CDU.

The CSU is more conservative than the CDU.

One very famous leader of the CSU was Franz Josef Strauß. Sometimes he was well known for the good that he did. Other times because of scandals.

The CSU is a very conservative party according to the people of Bavaria, who mainly live in the countryside and smaller towns and villages.

Traditionally it tried to make a compromise between conservative tradition and social welfare.

Currently it leans to more free market beliefs instead of social care.

Computation

The Theory of Computation is a branch of Mathematics. Generally it is seen as belonging to Computer science. The field of study of this subject is to see if a certain problem can be solved by a computer. If this is the case, then the question is to know if it can be solved in an efficient way. 

There are two major branches in it. The first is computability theory. It looks to see if a certain problem can be solved by a computer. Since this is a theoretical field of study, no real computers are used. They are replaced by a system called the Turing machine.

Once it is known if such a solution exists, computer scientists want to know if it can be found, and perhaps how it can be improved. This field of study is covered by the complexity theory. That theory has developed concepts to compare different methods of solving a problem to one another. Such methods are usually called algorithms. This is similar to comparing cooking recipes and seeing which of two recipes is easier to do.

Rod (unit)

A rod, a perch or a pole is a unit of length in the imperial and US systems.

In mediæval times English ploughmen used a wooden stick with a pointed tip to spur or guide their oxen. The rod was the length of this stick. In 1607 Edmund Gunter standardised this length.

The rod is still in use as a unit of measure in certain specialised fields. In recreational canoeing, overland paths where canoes must be carried are measured in rods. This is probably because the length of a typical canoe is about one rod. In the United Kingdom, some gardens are measured in rods.

In the episode of "The Simpsons" entitled "A Star is Burns", Grampa Simpson said "My car gets forty rods to the hogshead, and that's the way I likes it!" That's about 1.2 litres per metre, 12 feet per imperial gallon or 10 feet per U.S. gallon.

Chain (unit)

A chain is a unit of length. People usually used it for measuring land. There are a number of different chains from 50 to 100 feet long.

When people talk about the chain as a unit they normally mean the unit of the imperial or U.S. system. This is equal to 66 feet or 20.1168 metres. This is also called a "Gunter's chain", "surveyor's chain" or "land chain".

In the past people used to use wire chains for measuring land. These chains had 100 links. The links were made of thick wire with a loop at each end. The links were connected to each other by three rings. There were brass handles at each end. People folded the chain up, link by link, and carried it in their hand. The name "chain" comes from these devices.

The chain was also called an "acre's breadth". This is because an acre was defined as the area of a rectangle one chain wide and one furlong long.

The unit was once important in everyday life in United Kingdom and its colonies and in the United States. People used it when they made maps and planned out cities and towns.

Farmers in the United States and Canada still use measuring wheels of a chain around the outside. 

It is also the length of the pitch, between the wickets, in cricket.

Americans sometimes used a longer chain of 100 feet (30.48 m). This is called the "engineer's chain" or "Ramsden's chain".

Texans use another chain for measuring Spanish land grants. This chain is called the "Hispanic chain" or "vara chain". It is based on the vara. A vara is the equivalent of one yard in the old Spanish and Portuguese system of measurement. 

Since in Texas one Mexican foot is defined as English feet.

Furlong

A furlong is a measure of distance in imperial and U.S. systems. It is equal to 660 feet or 201.168 metres. There are eight furlongs in a mile.

The English first used the furlong in the 9th century or before. The name "furlong" comes from the Old English words "furh" (furrow) and "lang" (long). Originally it was the length of the furrow in one acre of a ploughed field. 

An acre is an area that is one furlong long and one chain wide. For this reason, the furlong was once also called an "acre's length". Around the year 1300, England standardised the furlong as 40 rods or 660 feet.

Distances for thoroughbred horse races in the United Kingdom, Ireland the United States, and Canada are still given in miles and furlongs. It is also used in the rail industry in the UK. Otherwise the unit is not used much.

Stefan Zweig (November 28,1881 in Vienna - February 22,1942 in Petropolis) was an Austrian writer. He volunteered to be a soldier in the First World War, and got the post as a military commentator. This made him an enemy of war. The Nazis gained power in Germany in 1933, and their influence could be felt in Austria as well. 1934, Stefan Zweig emigrated, first to London, then to South America. That way he lost much of his audience. He committed suicide (together with his second wife) in 1942. He did this through an overdose of sleeping pills.

He has written many books and poems. One of his best-known works is called "'Schachnovelle" ("The Royal Game", in English. In it, he describes a Chess player, that is forced to play against himself (while imprisoned). He explores the theme of madness. This book inspired the movie Geri's Game, made by Pixar in 1997

Complexity theory

Complexity theory is a type of Computer science. It looks at how hard a problem is to do for a computer, and how good particular solutions (algorithms) to that problem are. Different algorithms that solve a problem may be better or worse in multiple ways. An algorithm may be faster than some other algorithm, but it may need more resources, like memory. 

Part of complexity theory is understanding how algorithms perform in their worst-case scenario. An algorithm's worst-case scenario is a problem that will take a long time, or lots of resources, to solve. If people know how good an algorithm is in its worst case, they can guarantee that the algorithm will be at least that good in "every" case. People are also interested in how a certain algorithm does on average; many algorithms are very inefficient in their worst case, but are okay on most cases. Knowing how good an algorithm is on average lets people know what to generally expect when using that algorithm.

Binary operation

In mathematics, a binary operation, often denoted *, on a set is a way of combining a pair of elements in that set that results in another element of the set. For example, if we take a pair of natural numbers and let the operation * be addition, then their sum is also a natural number, and is the result of applying this particular binary operation. Another example of an operation on the natural numbers is multiplication. For instance, take the natural numbers 2 and 3. When multiplied together they give 6, another natural number.

Others: The sum between matrices. The composition of functions. The union and the intersection of sets are also two different binary operations on the set of all sets, or on subsets in a power set.

Kingdom Hearts II

Kingdom Hearts II is a video game from the "Kingdom Hearts" series for the Playstation 2. It has the characters of the Final Fantasy series and Walt Disney characters; for example Donald Duck, Goofy and Mickey Mouse. "Kingdom Hearts II" starts one year after the end of and continues the story from "Kingdom Hearts" and "Chain of Memories", for Playstation 2 and Game Boy Advance. It was released in Japan on December 22, 2005, in North America on March 28, 2006, and in Europe on September 29, 2006.

In "Kingdom Hearts II", the player controls a 15-year-old boy named Sora. Sora goes through different worlds (based around many different Disney movies) fighting different enemies like Heartless and Nobodies. Occasionally, there will be enemies you have to defeat that are based on the world you are in, such as the cursed pirates in Pirates of the Caribbean.

The player starts the game controlling Roxas, a 15-year-old boy living in a town called Twilight Town. He is on summer vacation with his three best friends, Hayner, Pence, and Olette. As a week goes by, strange things begin to happen. A man named Axel, a member of Organization XIII who was in "Chain of Memories", shows up and is surprised and upset that Roxas does not remember him. They fight, and Roxas discovers that he can use a Keyblade. Roxas also meets Naminé and a man named DiZ who was in Riku's side of "Chain of Memories". Naminé tells Roxas she has been changing his memories so he can become "whole" again. Axel tells Roxas they used to be friends and that he must either take Roxas back to the Organization or destroy him. They battle, and Axel disappears. Roxas then finds Sora, and disappears himself.

After Roxas disappears, Sora wakes up and becomes the new player character. Donald and Goofy also wake up, and the three of them continue their mission to find Riku. As they search for him, they meet the rest of the members of Organization XIII and learn that they are beings called Nobodies. When a Heartless steals someone's heart, that person also becomes a Heartless, but if their heart is strong, their body becomes a Nobody. Nobodies have no emotions, but want to have hearts again. Xemnas, the leader of Organization XIII, is trying to summon Kingdom Hearts, which he claims will enable the Nobodies to get their hearts back. To summon Kingdom Hearts, Heartless must be killed with a Keyblade, which will release the hearts they hold and let them return to Kingdom Hearts. This is the reason the Organization wanted Sora to join them.

It is later revealed that Roxas is Sora's Nobody, and was a member of Organization XIII. Roxas was created when Sora briefly lost his heart in "Kingdom Hearts". Naminé is then revealed to be Kairi's Nobody, who was created when Kairi lost her heart at the beginning of "Kingdom Hearts". Xemnas is the Nobody of a man called Xehanort, who no longer exists. Ansem, the main enemy from the first game, was Xehanort's Heartless.

Near the end of the game, Sora, Kairi and Riku reunite and destroy Xemnas. With all members of Organization XIII destroyed and the worlds apparently safe, Sora, Riku and Kairi go home to Destiny Islands.

"Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix +" is a reissue of the game that was released only in Japan on March 29, 2007. It has more content than "Kingdom Hearts II", including new areas, new battles, and a new secret ending. It is also for the PlayStation 2.

The name ""mithril"" comes from the Sindarin words "mith", meaning "grey", and "ril" meaning "glitter". In Quenya, its name is "mistarille". "Mithril" was also called "true-silver" or "Moria-silver". 

The most well known object made of "mithril" is probably the mail shirt of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins.

<doc id="46915" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46915" title="League (unit)">
League (unit)

A league is an old unit of length. It was first an ancient Celtic unit. It was the distance a person could walk in about one hour. The Romans adopted the league and it became a common unit of measurement throughout western Europe and Latin America.

In English-speaking countries the league was usually three statute miles (4.828032 kilometres) on land or three nautical miles at (5.556 km) sea. However, in writing the word "league" often means the Spanish, Portuguese or French league.

The league was used by Ancient Rome, which defined it as being Roman miles (7500 Roman feet or 2.22 km). The origin is the "leuga gallica" " (also: leuca Gallica)", the league of Gaul. The ancient league was short but the unit grew longer over time.

In Argentina a league is a distance of 5 km.

In Brazil the league was 6 km but it is not used anymore.

The French league had different values at different times: 10 000, 12 000, 13 200 and 14 400 French feet, about 3.25 km to about 4.68 km. It was used for a while together with the metric system but it is not used now. The nautical league was three nautical miles.

In the Mexican countryside the league is still commonly used in the original sense of the distance a person can walk in an hour. So a league along a good road on level ground is longer than a league on a difficult path over rough ground.

The Spanish league was originally set as a fixed unit of distance of 5,000 varas (a Spanish yard), about 2.6 miles or 4.2 km. In 1568 Philip II of Spain officially abolished the league. However, in parts of Latin America, people still use it (with different meanings in different countries).

In the American system there are two different quarts. There is a wet quart and a dry quart. There is only one imperial quart. One U.S. dry quart is a little smaller than one imperial quart. Six U.S. wet pints are about five imperial pints.

Ampere

The ampere or amp (Symbol: A) is the standard unit of electric current. For instance, an electric current of one amp is one coulomb per second. The amp is named after André-Marie Ampère who studied electromagnetism.

The amp is defined using two parallel wires placed one metre apart in a vacuum. The wires are very long and very thin. One amp is defined as the current producing an attractive force of 2×10 newtons per metre of length between these wires.

Corporation

A corporation is a union of natural persons that has its own legal status that is independent from the persons involved. It is a "creature" of statute; i.e., it is like a person created by law. Because it is recognized by governments as such (as a separate creature) it must file tax returns and pay taxes and conform to state and federal law. This separation of persons and corporation gives it special powers. Its status and capacity is determined by the law of the place of incorporation.

Investors and entrepreneurs often form joint stock companies to make a business easier. Therefore the term "corporation" often means such "business corporations". Corporations may also be formed for local government (municipal corporation), policial, religious, and charitable purposes (not-for-profit corporation), or government programs (government-owned corporation).

In common speech, the word "corporation" refers usually to limited responsibility corporation. That is a business firm where each of the partners invest a sum of money in as the capital of the corporation. They receive shares as recognition of the sum they have invested. If the company goes bankrupt, the business partners are responsible of only the name value of their shares, not their whole own personal property, of the company's debts.

Natural person

In jurisprudence, a natural person is a real human being in contrast to an artificial person, meaning an organization that the law treats for some purposes as if it were a person distinct from its members or owner.

For example, the right to vote is given to natural persons only. That is the case for most of the human rights. Therefore obviously a corporation cannot hold public office, but it can file a lawsuit.

Although science fiction has long fantasized about the possibility of sentient robots (e.g. androids) living among humans (such as Robin Williams "Bicentennial Man"), no court has yet dealt with the question of whether such a being would be considered a "natural person".

Jurisprudence

Jurisprudence is the theory and philosophy of law. Scholars of jurisprudence, or legal philosophers, hope to obtain a deeper understanding of the nature of law, of legal reasoning, legal systems and of legal institutions. As jurisprudence has developed, there are three main aspects with which scholarly writing engages:

Modern jurisprudence and philosophy of law is dominated today primarily by Western academics. The ideas of the Western legal tradition have become so pervasive throughout the world that it is tempting to see them as universal. Historically, however, many philosophers from other traditions have discussed the same questions, from Islamic scholars to the ancient Greeks.

Legal entity

A legal entity is a legal construct through which the law allows a group of natural persons to act as if they were a single person for certain purposes. The most common purposes are lawsuits, property ownership, and contracts. 

A legal entity is not always something else than the natural persons of which it is composed as one can see with a company or corporation. 

Some examples of legal entities include:

There are limitations to the legal recognition of artificial persons. Legal entities cannot marry, they cannot vote or hold public office, and in most jurisdictions there are certain positions which they cannot occupy. The extent to which a legal entity can commit a crime varies from country to country. Certain countries prohibit a legal entity from holding human rights; other countries permit artificial persons to enjoy certain protections from the state that are traditionally described as human rights.

examples of legal entities are 
- sole traders
-partnerships
- trusts
- private and public company

Ownership

Ownership means total possession or control of property, which may be an object, land/real estate, intellectual property or some other kind of property.

Ownership is needed for the development of the capitalist socio-economic system. The concept of ownership has existed for thousands of years and in all cultures.

Possession

Possession means to have some sort of control over something else. 

Generally, to possess something, a person must have an intention to possess it. A person may be in possession of some property (although possession does not always imply ownership). Like ownership, the possession of things is commonly regulated by states under property law.

When English explorer, Captain James Cook, claimed the country of Australia as a British country, he took "possession" of the land. The spot where he made his claim on 22 August 1770, a small island in the Torres Strait, is now called Possession Island.

Personal property means property that consists of object that can be moved from one place to another. 

In the common law systems personal property may also be called chattels. There it is distinguished from real property, or real estate. 

In the civil law systems personal property is often called movable property or movables - any property that can be moved from one location to another. This term is in distinction with immovable property or immovables, such as land and buildings.

<doc id="46950" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46950" title="Common law">
Common law

The common law is a kind of legal system. Under the common law, the law is not just made by legislation. Instead, it is also made by courts. Common-law courts use the precedent of earlier courts to help them make decisions.

The common law is used in the United Kingdom and most countries that used to be colonies of the British Empire, including the United States. Many other countries use a system called "civil law", where people say that legislation is the only kind of law. In common law countries, courts usually have more power than in civil law countries.

Common law started in England when courts decided to use tradition, custom, and precedent to help them make decisions. A "precedent" is something that another court has done in the past. By looking at decisions by earlier court, a common-law court tries to make decisions that will not surprise people and that fit in with the rest of the law.

In common law countries, when people like lawyers and judges want to know what the law is, they also look at what courts have written. When a court decides a case, it makes a decision and then usually delivers a "judgment" or a an "opinion" about what the law is. A judgment or court's opinion explains how the court reached its decision, and it is a guide for later courts that need to decide similar cases. The case sets a precedent. The judgments of higher courts will commonly tell lower courts how they must decide a case on the same or very similar facts - if so, the precedent is said to be "binding". Even if the facts are different, the reasoning in the case may still be considered by the court as "persuasive".

Even though courts follow precedent, legislation is still important in common-law countries. In fact, it is usually more powerful than precedent. For example, if legislation and precedent say different or opposite things, a court will usually have to follow the legislation.

In common-law countries, many important areas of law are mostly made by precedent. For example, in England and Wales and in most states of the United States, the law of contracts and torts is mostly made by precedent.

In a common-law country, sometimes the words "common law" are used to mean the law that the courts have made. For example, a lawyer or judge might say that a case can be decided using "only common law." This means that no legislation helps decide the case.

The words "common law" also sometimes mean the system of law that existed in England in the 1700s and 1800s. At that time, England had two different court systems. One was called "equity" and one was called "common law". "Law" was mostly for ordering people to pay money, and "equity" was mostly for other kinds of cases. Today, in most places, there are not two separate systems, and courts sometimes say that they work with both common law and equity.

Non-statutory law

Non-statutory law bases on the sources of law other than statutory law. Its authority rests not on legislation passed by Parliament and/or Administration and eventually codified, but rather tradition, custom and precedent. But like the case of the wiring regulations that are non-statutory you can still be prosecuted if they are not abided by.

The term codified law is sometimes used as a synonym for statutory law in general. In some U.S. states, the entire body of statutory law is referred to as a "code," such as the Ohio Revised Code. At the federal and state level in the United States, portions of the statutory law are also referred to as "code," such as the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Royal Canadian Air Cadets

The Royal Canadian Air Cadets is a program for Canadian youth. It is supported by sponsors in the community and Canada's Canadian Forces funded by the Department of National Defence. There are about 450 Air Cadet squadrons in every province and territory in Canada. The two other cadet programs for youth in Canada are the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets and the Royal Canadian Army Cadets.
People between the ages of 12 and 18 can join this program for free, and they are led by the officers of the Canadian Forces Cadet Instructor Cadre.

The aim of the Air Cadets is to "develop in youth the attributes of good citizenship and leadership; promote physical fitness; and to stimulate the interest of youth in the sea, land and air activities of the Canadian Forces. The Motto of the Air Cadets is "To Learn To Serve To Advance".

The rank system in Air Cadets is founded in that ranking system used by the former Royal Canadian Air Force with some modifications. Royal Canadian Air Cadets are not part of the Canadian Forces and do not have to join the Canadian forces.

1) Air Cadet (AC)- When people first join Air Cadets, they get the rank of an Air Cadet. 

2) Leading Air Cadet (LAC)- After someone joins and often takes part in the Air Cadet training for five months, they hold the rank of a leading Air Cadet. 

3) Corporal
A corporal is a non-commissioned officer. To become a corporal, an air cadet has to be a Leading Air Cadet (LAC) first, and finish Level 1 of Air Cadets successfully.

4) Flight Corporal
A new rank recently introduced in Sept 2007 as the first earned position of the chain of command. It is required that you have received the rank of corporal and successfully completed level 2.

5) Sergeant
To become a sergeant, an Air Cadet to be a flight corporal for at least 6 months and successfully finish Level 2 training in air cadets. It is better is they also complete a Familiarization Summer Course, but a cadet does not have to take this course to become a Sergeant.

6) Flight-Sergeant
To become a Flight Sergeant, an Air Cadet must be a sergeant for six months and successfully complete the level three training. They do not have to take and complete a Introductory Speciality Summer Course, but it is not mandatory.

<doc id="46956" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46956" title="Precedent">
Precedent

In law, a precedent or authority is a legal case that established a principle or rule that a court may need to adopt when deciding subsequent cases with similar issues or facts. 

The term may also refer to the collective body of case law that a court should consider when interpreting the law. When a precedent establishes an important legal principle, or represents new or changed law on a particular issue, that precedent is often known as a "landmark decision".

Precedent is very important in a fair legal system because it can allow the law to be enforced equally to all cases. For example, if a person crashes a car because they are drunk, the resulting court case will set a ""precedent"" for all similar cases. If a later case has a different result, the precedent may be changed. If we did not have this system, then it is likely that the law would not be fairly enforced.

<doc id="46958" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46958" title="Nasal hair">
Nasal hair

Nasal hair are small hair-like cells in the nose. Most of them can be found near the nostrils. The purpose of these hairs is to act as a filter, keeping dust and dirt out of the nasal passages. They also draw liquid mucus up from the epithelium by capillary action. In that way, they help to maintain humidity in the air passages and stop them from drying out. The hairs trap moisture as air is breathed out. The evaporation of trapped moisture on the hairs increases the humidity of air as it is breathed in. Note that nasal hair is different from the cilia found in the nose, which are part of the olfactory system.

Some cultures consider nose hair coming out from the nostrils to be ugly. The increased growth of nasal cilia with age (particularly for men) is often a source of anxiety and embarrassment. A number of devices have been sold to trim the nose hair, including small rotary clippers and attachments for electric shavers. However, given the role of nasal cilia, many doctors recommend trimming them lightly, if at all. There is evidence that the movement in the ciliar slows down with age. This may be the reason that old people have more respiratory infections.

<doc id="46965" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46965" title="Beetle">
Beetle

Beetles, the order Coleoptera, are the largest group of insects. There are 350,000 different species of beetles which have been named; that's about 40% of all known insects. There are an estimated 800,000 to a million living species. Beetles live almost everywhere, though not in the ocean or in places that are very cold, such as Antarctica.

Beetles went through a massive adaptive radiation early in their evolutionary history. The evolution of flowering plants helped drive the diversification of beetles. Four of the six biggest families of beetles are mainly angiosperm-feeders. 

People sometimes call some beetles by other names. Fireflies (also called lightning bugs) are actually beetles; so are ladybirds or ladybugs, which biologists call lady beetles.

In common with other insects, there are three main parts to a beetle's body: the head, the thorax (the middle part), and the abdomen (the back part). On the head, beetles have antennae (feelers), eyes, and a mouth. The legs and wings of the beetle are attached to the thorax. The abdomen of a beetle does not usually have special parts on the outside, but it has the beetle’s intestines inside. Like other insects, beetles have no internal bones, but instead have a hard exoskeleton on the outside of the body. The exoskeleton is made of hard plates of chitin.

Beetles differ from other flying insects because their front wings have evolved into hard covers, or "elytra". The back wings are used for flying. They are thin and are kept under the elytra when at rest. Beetles lift their leytra out of the way in order to fly. A few species of true bugs have a similar arrangement.

Not all beetles can fly. Some beetles do not have back wings, and some beetles cannot lift their front wings out of the way. Only a few beetles have no wings at all and can never fly. Some beetles with no wings look like larvae, and are called larviform.

The legs of beetles help them to walk, run, swim, and dig. All beetles have six legs. Each leg is made out of several parts. The parts on the end of each leg are called tarsi. The last tarsus (the singular of tarsi) of each beetle “foot” has one or two claws on the end of it. Most beetles use their legs to walk or run. Some beetle legs are flat and have long hairs on them. These kinds of legs are found on water beetles. Beetles that often dig in soil have flat legs with spines or horns at the edges. Flat legs with horns are called fossorial legs. A few beetles have large hind legs, similar to those of grasshoppers, which help the beetle to jump. Flea beetles are an example of jumping beetle.

Beetles have compound eyes, which means the two big shiny eyes on the head are actually made out of many smaller parts. Sometimes the two eyes are each divided in half so that it looks like there are four eyes. One beetle family, the whirligig beetles, has divided eyes so that when they are swimming they can see on top of the water and inside the water at the same time. A few beetles have extra simple eyes (usually two) called ocelli. The ocelli are on the top of the beetle’s head.

Because beetles have no nose, they use their antennae to smell things. Beetles also use their antennae to feel things around them. Some beetles use their antennae to fight other beetles or even to fight larger animals that want to eat them. Beetle antennae do not all look the same. Some antennae are long and thin, while others are short and wide. Thin antennae are called filiform antennae, and antennae that are wide on the end are called clavate antennae.

The mouth of a beetle is very different from the mouth of a person. Most beetles have two hard mandibles at the front of their mouth which are a bit like teeth. Mandibles help the beetle eat by crushing and cutting food. In some beetles, the mandibles look like big pincers. Beetles also have four “fingers” around their mouth that push food into the mouth of the beetle. These fingers are called palpi.

Beetles do not breathe; instead they have holes called spiracles in the sides of their bodies which lead to trachea, which act like lungs. Beetles do not have blood, but they have something like blood, called haemolymph. It is a green colour. That's because their haemoglobin molecule has a copper atom at its centre, wheras ours has an iron atom there.

Beetles start out as eggs that a female beetle lays. Some beetles can lay thousands of eggs during their lives. A larva comes out when an egg hatches. Most beetle larvae do not look like adult beetles. A beetle larva eats and grows larger until it changes and becomes a pupa. When the pupa opens, an adult beetle, sometimes called an imago, comes out. This way of growing up is called complete metamorphosis.

Beetles eat the most when they are larvae. Some beetle larvae eat the outside of plants; some eat inside plants. Some beetle larvae are predators, which means they hunt for other insects to eat. Other beetle larvae eat dead things, such as dead plants and dead animals.

Not all beetle larvae look the same. Some beetle larvae are flat and move very fast. To describe these larvae, scientists use the descriptive word campodeiform. Some beetle larvae look similar to hard worms with tiny legs. These have an elateriform shape. Click beetle larvae have a special name: wireworms. Other beetle larvae are short and very thick and are called grubs. In a few beetles, the larvae change their shape after some time. Blister beetle larvae start out moving fast, such as campodeiform larvae, but end up slow and thick.

Beetles eat many different things including living plants, rotting plants, animals that may be dead or alive, and animal feces. Some beetles can eat both plants and animals, while others you eat just one type of food. Beetles that can only eat one kind of thing are said to be host specific. Many leaf beetles and longhorn beetles are host specific.

Beetles are tough animals for their size. They are mechanically tough (the elytra), and have a variety of strategies to avoid being attacked by predators or parasitoids. These include camouflage, mimicry, toxicity, and active defense.

Some beetles live in places that are hard for predators to find. Some beetles, such as longhorn beetles, live in tunnels inside tree branches. Only special predators that are small enough to use the long-horned beetle tunnels can eat the longhorn beetles.

Other beetles do not live in special places but they have colours or shapes that make them hard to find. When beetles have colours so that predators cannot see them, this is called camouflage. Some leaf beetles are green so that they can not be seen when they are on green leaves. Some beetles have very complex colours so that they look like bird faeces.

Sometimes beetles use colour to warn predators (warning colouration). Some beetles have black and yellow stripes so that they look similar to bees and wasps. Some beetles even behave similar to bees to confuse predators. 

Beetles have a wide range of chemical defences, mostly got from plants their larvae eat. These chemicals make them taste bad when predators eat them. Blister beetles are so poisonous that if a horse eats only a few of them, the horse may die! Bombardier beetles squirt hot poisonous liquid at attackers. Lady beetles put out a cyanide compound when molested. Lady beetles also have colours that warn predators that they taste bad. Insects which taste foul use warning colours which birds learn about and avoid. Also, other species which are tasty copy those warning colours. This is called mimicry, and is quite common in insects.

Very large beetles sometimes fight predators. Beetles that fight will often use their mandibles as teeth to bite their predators.

Beetles have sexual reproduction, which means males and females mate in order to make offspring.

Before reproduction, male beetles sometimes fight to claim a female. This especially happens with stag beetles: males will fight using their long mandibles.

Some beetles give special care to their eggs or larvae. Some scarab beetles, called dung beetles, roll balls of dung (faeces) and put them in a hole in the ground. The female lays her eggs in the dung. When the eggs hatch, the larvae will eat the dung that their mother supplied for them.

Different kinds of beetles can be divided into groups called families. There are many beetle families. The biggest families are listed here.

Some beetles cause trouble for farmers and people in forests because they eat crops or trees. These beetles are called pests. One beetle that hurts crops is the Colorado beetle; another is the Maize weevil. One that destroys trees is the Emerald ash borer.

Other beetles help people; lady beetles (also called ladybirds and ladybugs) eat insects that hurt crops and trees.

People who study beetles are called coleopterists.

Staff (music)

A staff (or stave) is the name given to the five horizontal lines on which we can write music. Musical notes can be placed either on a line (i.e. with a line going through the middle of the note head) or in a space. There are four inside spaces as well as the two outer spaces at the top or bottom. The higher the pitch of the note the higher it will be on the staff. Taking the white notes of a keyboard: each note (A, B, C, D etc) is placed higher on the stave (line, space, line, space etc). A clef is needed to show which notes they are. There are different clefs to suit high, medium or low instruments.

This musical example shows the opening of "Symphony no 5" by Beethoven. The first three notes are on the second line (counting from the bottom). They are Gs, because there is a treble clef at the beginning of the staff. The fourth note is a little lower: on the bottom line, the E line (because of the flats in the key signature it is an E flat). The next note is between the other two in pitch (an F). After the three Fs comes a D in the outside bottom space.

Sometimes composers have used staves with fewer or more than 5 lines, but the five-line staff started to become the usual one in Western music in the 13th century.

When notes are a little too high or low to put on the stave, extension lines are used. These are called leger lines. 

If two or more staves are being played at the same time the staves are joined on the left by a bracket which is called a brace. Piano music, for example, is written on two staves: one for the right hand and one for the left.

Instruments that only play a rhythm (such as the cymbals), do not need a stave. The notes can be written just on one line. The beats are crosses.

In an orchestral or vocal score (music for a conductor showing what all the instruments play or each group of singers sing) the staves that are bracketed together are called a system. If the whole orchestra are playing there will only be room for one system on each page (because each instrument or group of instruments needs its own staff), but in places where only a few instruments are playing there may be two or three systems on a page to save space and unnecessary turning.

The Colorado potato beetle, "Leptinotarsa decemlineata", is a beetle. It is sometimes just called the Colorado beetle. It is one of the worst potato pests in the world. 

The beetle is notable for its ability to resist pesticides. Over the last 50 years it has become resistant to 52 chemical compounds used in insecticides, including cyanide. However, not every population is resistant to every chemical.

The Colorado beetle first lived in the southwest United States and northern Mexico. Now it lives in most of North America and also in Europe and Asia.

The Colorado potato beetle now eats cultivated potato plants. Both larvae and adults eat the leaves and strip the plant down to a skeleton. They may also attack tomato and eggplants. There can be so many Colorado potato beetles in potato farms that they destroy the potatoes.

Because the beetle rapidly evolves resistance to chemicals, the best defence may be biological control. A ground beetle, "Lebia grandis" is a predator of the eggs and larvae, and its larvae are parasitoids of the Colorado beetle's pupae. 

"Beauveria bassiana" (Hyphomycetes) is a pathogenic fungus that infects many insects, including the Colorado beetle. It is probably the most widely used natural enemy of the Colorado beetle. There are commercial formulations that can be applied using a pesticide sprayer. 

The Colorado potato beetle did not always eat potato plants. This is because potatoes came from South America, not near the beetle's original range. Before people brought potatoes to North America, the Colorado beetle ate a plant called buffalo-bur.

Opiliones

The Harvestmen are eight-legged arachnids. Although they belong to the class of arachnids, harvestmen are not spiders. They belong to the order Opiliones or Phalangids. 

More than 6,400 species of harvestmen have been discovered, although the real number of extant species may exceed 10,000. Well-preserved fossils have been found in the 400-million year old Rhynie cherts of Scotland. The samples found look surprisingly modern. Apparently, the basic structure of the harvestmen has not changed much since then. 

In some places, harvestmen are known by the name "daddy longlegs", but this name is also used for two other unrelated arthropods: the crane fly ("Tipulidae") and the cellar spider ("Pholcidae").

Many species are omnivores, they eat anything they can find. Most of the time this is small insects, and some plants and fungi. Some are scavengers. 

Harvestmen are not dangerous to humans. None of the described species has poison glands. They are not "true" spiders even though they look like spiders in many ways. For example, harvestmen have no venom or silk glands; spiders have these.

These arachnids have exceptionally long walking legs, compared to body size, although there are also short-legged species. In harvestmen the two main body sections (the abdomen and cephalothorax) are broadly joined, so that they appear to be one oval structure; they also have no venom or silk glands, unlike true spiders. In more advanced species, the first five abdominal segments are often fused into a dorsal shield called the scutum, which is normally fused with the carapace. In some species, this shield is only present in males. The second pair of legs is longer than the others and works as antennae. This can be hard to see in short-legged species.

The feeding apparatus (stomotheca) differs from other arachnids: chunks of food can be taken in, rather than liqids. Most species have a single pair of eyes in the middle of their heads, oriented sideways. However, there are some eyeless species.

Shikon no Tama

The Shikon no Tama (English:The Jewel of Four Souls) is the fictional magic jewel in the anime and manga series InuYasha. It is called the Jewel of Four Souls because it has four souls of 4 different names: Aramitama (Courage), Nigimitama (Friendship), Kushimitama (Wisdom) and Sakimitama (Love). The souls can make a person very powerful.

When Midoriko was about to die fighting a demon, she joined her 4 soul inside her heart, with the soul of the demon to make it good and pure. By doing that, she killed herself and the demon. This created the Shikon jewel. Inside it, Midoriko and the demon souls still fought each other. This battle is depends to the person who has the jewel. The jewel can become pure (become good because Midoriko is winning) or impure (become bad because the demon is winning). Many creatures want the jewel because it can make them powerful like Midoriko. They can do anything they want with it. If someone wants to become a full demon then they will become that, just like Naraku wants to. 

After many fights of different demons and humans, Shako, Sango's grandpa found the jewel from a demon called Mistress Centipede. The jewel was impure because it had been with the evil Mistress Centipede. He took the jewel to Kikyo. Only the goodness of Kikyo's priestess's power could purify it and make it good. But when Kikyo is burnt because she dies by Naraku wanting the jewel and killing her, and she wants the jewel to burn and destroy along with her. Kagome, Kikyo's reincarnation gets the jewel even so, and when Mistress Centipede's bones inside the well become alive with the jewel's power when Kagome comes near, she is dragged into the well and the past where everything happened. Kagome shatters the jewel by accident when she shoots a crow which swallowed it, and has to find all the pieces before evil creatures do with Inuyasha. 

Some people tried to make shikon no tama themselves so that they can have its power without trying to find all the pieces. Izumo, a half-demon who turns to a demon at night, but a human at day, is a clever alchemist who likes nature and the world. He is the one who knows how to make a shikon no tama, and a frog-demon with some other demons grab him so that they can start making a fake shikon no tama. Izumo agrees and makes many copies of shikon no tamas which only has small power. He said to the frog-demon that to make the copies like the real one, they had to collect the souls of people with Aramitama (Courage), Nigimitama (Friendship), Kushimitama (Wisdom) and Sakimitama (Love). When Inuyasha and his friends come to save Izumo who plans to get them because of his friends having the souls that he needed to make a real shikon no tama. 

Inuyasha had the soul of Aramitama (Courage), Shippo with Nigimitama (Friendship), Miroku with Kushimitama (Wisdom) and Sango with Sakimitama (Love). Kagome tries to save her friends who are inside the frog eggs made by the frog-demon, and in the end he is killed together with Izumo in his half-demon form. Kagome was sad because she felt for Izumo but they carried on their adventure anyway.

Daddy long-legs spider

The Daddy-Long-Legs Spider ("Pholcus phalangioides") is a spider of the family Pholcidae. Its legs are about 5 or 6 times the length of its body. It is often confused with the "daddy long-legs", a member of the Opiliones, which are not true (real) spiders. "P. phalangioides" has the habit of shaking the web violently when disturbed. This is probably to blur the vision of a predator. Because it is often found on the ceilings of rooms, caves or cellars, it is also called cellar spider. They can easily catch and eat hairy house spiders, mosquitoes, and other insects. When food is scarce, they will prey on their own kind. Because they originally came from the tropics, these spiders do not seem to be aware of seasonal changes and breed at any time of the year. 

The female holds 20 to 30 eggs in her jaws. Spiderlings are transparent with short legs and change their skin about 5 or 6 times as they grow.

Females have a body length of about 9mm, males are slightly smaller.

"Crossopriza lyoni" and "Physocyclus globosis" are spiders with a very similar appearance.

Crane fly

Crane flies are a type of fly in the family Tipulidae. They are insects. Crane flies look like big mosquitoes. Unlike mosquitoes, crane flies do not bite people or animals.

There are about 4,000 different kinds or species of crane flies. This means that the Tipulidae (crane flies) are the largest group of flies. Most crane fly species (75%) were found by Charles P. Alexander). 

People in different places call crane flies different names. Most of these names are only used by people in small areas. Some of the other names for crane flies are, mosquito hawks, mosquito eaters (or skeeter eaters), gallinippers, and jimmy spinners. In the United Kingdom they are most commonly referred to as Daddy Long-Legs, but in the United States the name Daddy Long-Legs is given to arachnids that look like thin spiders and that scientists call Opiliones. 

Adult crane flies are long and thin. They have very long legs and a long, thin abdomen. It is very easy to accidentally break off their delicate legs when catching crane flies. This may help them to escape from birds who try to eat them. Females have larger abdomens in comparison to the males. The female abdomen also ends in a pointed ovipositor that looks a bit like a stinger. Crane flies cannot sting.

The wings are often held out from the body when the crane fly is not moving. When the wings are held out, the large halteres (balancers) can be seen behind the wings. Unlike mosquitoes, crane flies can not fly well. They will sometimes "wobble" when flying. 

Crane flies that live in temperate places, such as "Tipula" species, may grow as big as 60 mm in size. Tropical crane flies may grow to more than 100 mm . The Giant Crane Fly ("Holorusia rubiginosa") that lives in the western United States can reach 38 mm (1-3/8 inches). There are also small crane flies, called bobbing gnats. These are the size of mosquitoes, but you can tell they are not mosquitoes by the V-shaped suture (groove) on the middle part of their body, the thorax. Crane flies also do not have ocelli, which are extra tiny eyes on the top of their heads.

Larvae of crane flies are divided into segments. They have a distinct head capsule on the front. The segments on the rear portion of the larva (the abdominal segments) often have long fleshy projections (like tentacles). Scientists have never seen the larvae from most crane fly species: less than 2% of the larvae are known.

Even though crane flies look like mosquitoes, they do not bite humans. They also do not eat mosquitoes. Adult crane flies eat nectar or they do not eat at all; most adult crane flies only mate and then die once they become adults.

Crane fly larvae are called leatherjackets or 'leatherjacket slugs' because of the way they move and eat roots (such as those of grass in lawns) and other vegetation. Leatherjackets can sometimes cause damage to plants. Because of this, people sometimes think crane flies are a pest of lawn grass in some areas. Some leatherjackets are aquatic, which means they live in water.

Many birds eat crane flies.

<doc id="46993" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46993" title="Neville Chamberlain">
Neville Chamberlain

Arthur Neville Chamberlain, (surname pronounced: "CHAIM-BER-LIN"; 18 March 1869 – 9 November 1940) was a politician, Lord Mayor of Birmingham, Chancellor of the Exchequer and British Prime Minister from 1937 to 1940.
Neville was born in Edgbaston, in Birmingham. His father was Joseph Chamberlain, an important politician. His half-brother (they had different mothers), Austen Chamberlain, also became an important politician. Neville went to Rugby school. He became interested in botany (plants), 
birds and fishing. Neville also loved music and literature (reading). He studied metallurgy at Mason college, which Joseph Chamberlain later made part of the University of Birmingham. Later, he became an apprentice in an accounting company.

Neville became a successful manager in a manufacturing company. In 1911, when he was 42, the people of Birmingham elected (chose) him to be part of the city council. On the council, he had the job of planning improving the city, the same kind of work his father had done. He planned new houses for poor people. In 1915 he became Lord Mayor of Birmingham, also as his father had done. In this job he did work to improve the city, including starting the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra.
In 1916, the prime minister, Lloyd George asked Chamberlain to manage the in control of conscription, making civilians become soldiers in times of war. Chamberlain and Lloyd-George often argued, and soon they did not like each other. Chamberlain left the job the next year. Instead, he entered the 1918 general election and became the Conservative Member of Parliament for Ladywood in Birmingham.
In 1923, the prime minister Andrew Bonar Law made Chamberlain the health minister In this job, Chamberlain did more work to help poor people. For example he made a law that connected rent prices to how good the building was. Chamberlain was then Chancellor of the Exchequer, in charge of the economy, for a short time. After the 1924 general election, he became health minister again, where he stayed until the Conservatives lost the 1929 general election. Between 1924 and 1929, Chamberlain helped to make many new laws to help poor people, including a pensions system that helped to make Britain's welfare state after the Second World War.

In 1929, the Conservatives lost the general election, and Ramsay MacDonald became the new Labour prime minister. At this time, the Conservative party was trying to put tariffs (taxes) on imports to make trade in the British Empire stronger. Other people, including Lord Beaverbrook, a businessman who owned a lot of newspapers, disagreed, saying that trade should be free. Lord Beaverbrook started a new party to fight the Conservatives. Chamberlain fought Beaverbrook's part in an election, and won. This made him very popular in the Conservative party.

An economic crisis in 1931 led to another general election. After the election, Chamberlain became Chancellor of the Exchequer. In this position he worked to cancel debts from the war. In 1932 he was able to start a tariff system. His father, Joseph Chamberlain had spent a long time working for a stronger British Empire when he was foreign secretary. He also worked hard for a tariff system before he died, because he believed it would make the Empire economically independent. Neville was pleased to make his father's wishes come true.
By 1934, Chamberlain felt that the economy had recovered. However, at this time many important people, including Chamberlain's half-brother Austen and Winston Churchill were warning that Nazi Germany was (building its military). These men said that Britain must rearm, too. In July 1934 the government told parliament that it had a plan to make the Royal Air Force much stronger. 

However, not everybody was happy to see an arms race ( a competition with Germany to build a bigger military). The First World War was still in people's memories, and there was a pacifist feeling in the country. Chamberlain advised the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, to talk about rearmament in the 1935 general election. Baldwin was worried people would not vote for them if they talked about making the military stronger, so he talked about housing and unemployment instead.

Chamberlain worked hard with a slow economy. The government bought factories that were not being used, and spent money making them new again. This idea helped when the war began because Britain had the most modern equipment. When he announced (told the public about) his budget (plan for the economy) in 1935, the Labour party said he wanted war. Other people still said he was not doing enough to build the military. In 1936 the government announced plans to build the Royal Navy.

Stanley Baldwin retired in 1937, and Chamberlain became the new prime minister on the 28th May. Chamberlain is mostly remembered for being the prime minister as Europe moved into the Second World War, but as prime minister he also made some important changes in Britain. He made laws that made working conditions better. He limited working hours for women and children. He introduced paid holiday for a large part of the population. He laws to try to make the population healthier by exercising and medical inspection. Many other changes were planned, but the start of the war stopped these changes from happening.

In the 1930's, the Irish Taoiseach (similar to a prime minister) was Éamon de Valera. de Valera worked to make a new constitution (set of laws) for Ireland. He wanted to make Ireland independent from Britain. Ireland had its own government, but Britain still controlled Northern Ireland, and had naval ports (called treaty ports) in Ireland. de Valera wanted this control to stop. Chamberlain wanted Ireland to support Britain if there was a war because he knew that without Irish help, defending the Atlantic Ocean would be difficult. Chamberlain and his Secretary of State, Malcolm MacDonald made an agreement to give the treaty ports back to Ireland, but hoped that British warships might use them in the war.

Many Conservatives, including Winston Churchill, (who had made an agreement to have the treaty ports in 1921) disagreed strongly with this plan. This agreement, together with a plan to limit the number of Jewish people moving into Palestine (which was controlled by Britain at this time) made Chamberlain unpopular with many people.
Although many people warned about the threat of Nazi Germany, Chamberlain only chose ministers that agreed with him, and wanted to avoid war. Chamberlain, together with many people of the same age, were very worried about war. They believed that people like Adolf Hitler were in power because their people felt that their situation was unfair. German people felt that the Treaty of Versailles (an agreement made to end the First World War) was unfair. When Nazi Germany (took control of) Austria and the Sudetenland (a part of Czechoslovakia), Chamberlain tried to keep peace. 

In September 1938 he flew to Munich to speak with Hitler. Together with the French prime minister, Édouard Daladier and the Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, he made an agreement with Hitler. Hitler was allowed to control the Sudetenland, but had to agree not to use his military to solve future disputes (disagreements). When Chamberlain returned home, many people said he had done a wonderful job. Chamberlain was very pleased, and said that the agreement meant "peace for our time".

In March of 1939, the German military moved in to control the rest of Czechoslovakia. This was against the Munich agreement. Chamberlain realised that his attempts to control Hitler had failed. He started to get Britain ready for war, using the new factories that had been built. Many new weapons were built, including the Supermarine Spitfire (a fighter aircraft), and radar. When the Germans invaded Poland on 1st September 1939, the British and the French talked together and decided to declare war on Germany (tell Germany war had started). Chamberlain spoke on the radio, and told the British people that war had begun.

Chamberlain made a new government, and included Winston Churchill. After the Germans invaded Norway in April 1940, the British sent a naval force to fight them. The plan was not a success, however, and parliament no longer supported Chamberlain. on 10 May 1940, Chamberlain resigned. Churchill became the prime minister, but Chamberlain stayed in the government. Later in May, Germany offered conditions for peace (things they wanted to stop fighting). Most of the government, including Chamberlain, wanted to agree with Germany and stop fighting. Churchill did not want to agree with Germany. He spoke with Chamberlain, and soon Chamberlain began to agree with Churchill. The result was that Britain stayed in the war.

In the summer of 1940, Chamberlain became sick. In July he had an operation on his stomach to treat cancer. He tried to return to work, but became too weak, and had to retire. He died on 9 November 1940 of bowel cancer. He was 71 years old.
Winston Churchill spoke to parliament to tell them about Chamberlain's death. He praised Chamberlain as a good, honest man.

People disagree about the history of Chamberlain. Some people think that his actions were wrong because he did not stop Hitler. Other people say that he gave Britain and France more time to get ready for war.

A quadratic equation is an equation in the form of formula_1, where a is not equal to 0. It makes a parabola (a "u" shape) when graphed on a coordinate plane.
The quadratic formula is a formula used to find the points where the graphed equation crosses the x-axis, or the horizontal axis. These points are called the "zeroes" of a function. The formula is:
Where the letters are the corresponding numbers of the original equation, formula_1. Also, formula_4 cannot be 0 for the formula to work properly.
The factored form of this equation is y=a(x-s)(x-t).

The Association pour la Taxation des Transactions pour l'Aide aux Citoyens (Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens, ATTAC) is an organization that promotes a tax on foreign exchange transactions, the so-called Tobin tax. 

At first Attac demanded only the introduction of the so-called Tobin tax on currency speculation. Now it fights for many issues related to globalisation. Therefore it reports about the decisions of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). ATTAC attends the meetings of the G8 with the goal of influencing policymakers' decisions.

Though ATTAC criticises the neoliberal ideology dominating economic globalisation, it is not "anti-globalisation". It supports globalisation policies that they characterise as sustainable and socially just. One of ATTAC's slogans is "The World is not for sale", denouncing the "merchandisation" of society.

Firefly

Fireflies are a family of beetles called the Lampyridae. These beetles are special in that most of them have bioluminescence, the ability to produce light. They are sometimes called 'lightning bugs' or 'forest stars'. There are about 2000 different species, most of which are nocturnal.

Adults use flashes of light to attract mates. Also, firefly larvae flash their lights to warn predators that they are not a tasty meal. Many predators do not like the taste of firefly larvae.

A firefly is an insect so it has an exoskeleton and three body parts. Their exoskeleton gives protection. The body parts are the head, thorax and abdomen. The head has small eyes and long antennae (feelers).

On a firefly’s thorax there are six jointed legs. At the end of their legs fireflies have claws. 

A firefly can be brown or black with yellow and red marks.

All fireflies glow as larvae. Bioluminescence serves a different function in lampyrid larvae than it does in adults. It appears to be a warning signal to predators, since many firefly larvae contain chemicals that are distasteful or toxic.

Light in adult beetles was originally thought to used for similar warning purposes, but its main purpose is now thought to be mate selection. Fireflies are a classic example of an organism that uses bioluminescence for sexual selection. They have evolved a variety of ways to communicate with mates in courtships: steady glows, flashing, and the use of chemical signals unrelated to photic systems.

Fireflies live in tropical climates in the United States, Latin America, Caribbean Island, and South East Asia. They also live east of Rocky Mountains. Fireflies like to live in damp areas and dry areas. Examples of damp areas are rain forests, streams, marshes, ponds and leaf piles. Examples of dry areas are backyards and meadows. 

Most species live in marshes or near water, because there their larvae have more than enough food.

Phengodidae is a family of glow-worm beetles. Their larvae are also glow-worms.

The family occurs only in the New World, and has about 30 genera. Both the females and larvae are bioluminescent: they have organs that can produce light. This family is different from the fireflies (family Lampyridae).

The larvae and the females (which keep their larval form) are predators. They feed on millipedes and other animals they find in the soil and litter. Males are winged. They are attracted to lights at night. They are probably short-lived and do not feed at all. In some species, adult males can also produce light. Females have organs that produce a green or yellow light on their trunks. Some of them (called railroad worms) also have such an organ in front, which can produce a red light.

<doc id="47024" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47024" title="Rumiko Takahashi">
Rumiko Takahashi

Rumiko Takahashi（高橋留美子）is a Japanese manga artist. She made popular manga books like: Ranma ½ and InuYasha. She is the richest woman in Japan and her manga is loved all over the world. She was born in Niigata, on October 10, 1975. She joined Gekiga Sonjuku college: a manga school run by Kazuo Koike, also a manga artist. With the school's help, she managed to make a "doujinshi" (self-published work mostly for beginners) manga artwork, for example, Bye-Bye Road and Star of Futile Dust.

She first started with a "Those selfish aliens" in 1978, followed by "Time Warp Trouble", "Shake Your Buddha", and "The Golden Gods of Poverty", published in Shonen Sunday - this place was to become the publisher of her most important works. Later in this year she tried "Urusei Yatsura" (Lamu, the invader girl), her first full series of books. This had some publishing problems, but even so, it became the most loved manga comedy in Japan.

In 1980, she wrote a lot of books. The most important was "Maison Ikkoku" from 1980 to 1987. She finished both Urusei Yatsura (34 books) with Maison Ikkoku (15 books). After that she began a dark, story telling type of manga - the "Mermaid Saga", finished at 1994, with the story "Mermaid's mask". It is thought to be unfinished because it did not have a note to tell the reader it was ended. "One-pound Gospel" was her next book. It was nearly not finished because of the ending similar to Mermaid Saga, with the last story done in 2001.

At late 1987, she began another major manga called Ranma ½. It ended in 1996 with 38 books altogether. During 1990s, she began InuYasha. It was a magical story very similar to Mermaid Saga. Rumiko Takahashi had said that she would make it up to 500 chapters and 50 books. That would make it the longest she's ever made for now.

In 1981, Urusei Yatsura was the first work to become an anime. This series began showing on October 14 at the Japanese television by studio called Kitty Animation. This had many different directors during the making of this anime. The most well known director was Mamoru Oshii. He also directed the second Urusei Yatsura movie, Beautiful Dreamer. This is thought his best work for this anime. Kitty Animation also made the anime of Maison Ikkoku in 1986 (with 96 episodes and 4 Original Video Animation (OVA)s, which are animes made only on video but not on TV). It also made Ranma ½ in anime. Kitty Animation stopped because of problems, and Ranman ½ anime also stopped during episode 161.

Sunrise was the next studio to make animes out of Rumiko Takahashi's mangas. They made 167 episodes of InuYasha animes, started on 2000 and ending in 2004. As with Ranma ½, InuYasha did not finish too. This was because the manga InuYasha was too long to continue in anime. Mermaid Saga anime was made in 2003 for 13 series of the manga.

The later animes are from her short mangas like: The Tragedy of P, The Merchant of Romance, Middle-Aged Teen, Hidden In The Pottery, Aberrant Family F, As Long As You Are Here, One Hundred Years of Love, In Lieu of Thanks, Living Room Lovesong, House of Garbage, One Day Dream, Extra-Large Size Happiness and The Executive's Dog.

Rumiko Takahashi is still popular in Europe, mostly in France. Viz Media is the studio that translated most of the animes in English. At early 1990s, they began to translate Urusei Yatsura the anime. Because it was difficult to translate the Japanese way of life/culture and the confusing puns and wordplay, they stopped the series. Mermaid Saga, Maison Ikkoku and Inuyasha could go on even so. Ranma ½ was popular for English-speakers. It was shown all over the world. Viz also showed InuYasha anime on Adult Swim, where it was very popular. InuYasha is the very popular even now. Even with many of her works have Japanese cultures that is difficult to understand in them, the believable characters in them and their feelings are easy to understand all over the world.

Debate

Debate (American English) or debating (British English) is a formal method of argument. 

It is a larger form of argument than logical argument, because in a debate, the debaters try to influence the feelings of the hearers, in order to persuade them on a topic. Disputes and conflicts may be settled by debate.

Informal debates like discussion are very common, but the quality of a debate improves with knowledge and skill of its participants as debaters. 
Deliberative bodies such as parliaments, legislative assemblies, and meetings of all sorts have debates. The winner of a debate may be decided by the audiences vote, by judges, or by both. 

Formal debates between candidates for a elected office are quite common in places where leaders of countries are chosen by the people. The most well-known of these debates are between candidates for the President and Vice President of the United States, and leaders debates between leaders of parties in Parliament in countries like Great Britain and Canada.

Momofuku Ando

, born Wú Bǎifú (吳百福) in Taiwanese (March 5, 1910 - January 5, 2007) was the founder and chairman of Nissin Food Products Co., Ltd., and the inventor of the modern instant noodle, ramen.

Ando was born to Taiwanese parents in Kagi (currently Chiayi), Taiwan and grew up an orphan in Tainan City. In 1948, Momofuku Ando founded what was to become Nissin in Ikeda, Osaka, Japan. It was a small family-run company at first.

On August 25, 1958, at the age of 48, and after months of trial and error experimentation, Ando announced that he had finally perfected his flash-frying method and therefore invented the instant noodle. Called Chikin Ramen, after the original flavour, it was originally considered a luxury food item as it cost around six times that of traditional non-instant udon and soba noodles. Ando began sales of the Cup noodles on September 18, 1971. As prices dropped, ramen soon became a booming business. An estimated 70 billion servings were sold in 2004.

In 1964, looking for a way to promote the instant noodle industry, Ando founded the Instant Food Industry Association which set guidelines for fair competition and product quality, introducing several industry standards such as the inclusion of production dates on packaging. The Momofuku Ando Instant Ramen Museum is named after Ando.

Ando was also the chairman of the International Ramen Manufacturers’ Association. He died on January 5, 2007 of heart failure in Osaka Prefecture at the age of 96.

<doc id="47033" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47033" title="Demon">
Demon

A demon or daemon is a bad or powerful being in many world religions. The word is also used for a type of computer program that does useful things in the background of a computer, but this use is not related to the religious meaning. 

A demon is usually thought to be a supernatural creature that is a bad spirit. Demons are often described as being called by someone, and then working in a bad way. "To demonize" means to make someone appear evil. 

In a few writings, there are also good demons, for example in stories by James Clerk Maxwell, Hesiod and Shakespeare. In Indo-European mythology and traditions of Iranian Avestan and Vedic, the idea of "demons" was there for many years. Ancient Egyptians thought of demons as "monsters" that ate souls of people when they went to the afterlife. In ancient Greek mythology, there are also "daemons" but they were thought to be invisible protectors that they believed protect them. In the book "Northern Lights" by Philip Pullman, a daemon is said to be a creature that everyone has as part of the body. So if it is far away from someone, that person would feel hurt.

In the Greek New Testament and Hebrew Old Testament, demons are said to be bad. In Hebrew, demons are called "se'irim". In other Hebrew writings, they do not come from heaven, but came from another world and made much troubles. They gave diseases too. And they have a prince who is not God, but a demon.

In Hinduism, demons are called "asuras". "Patala" is thought to be an underground place below the Earth, where humans live. "Asura" means supernatural beings that were good or bad. People who do evil and horrible things in their lives, by reincarnation, will turn into evil, ghost spirits called "Vetalas, Pishachas, Bhūtas".

In Islam, "Djinns" are creatures that cannot be seen by people most of the time, made of fire, with special powers to help and harm people: but in Islam, "djinns" must serve and obey God (Allah).

"Monotheistic" religions (that say there is one God) usually teach that demons are rebels and under God's authority at all times. The English poet John Milton describes Satan as rebelling against God but losing, and being allowed to survive only by God's grace. In some "polytheistic" religions, demons are equal to gods. In Hinduism, the demon-goddess Kali represents destruction and thus from a human standpoint is "bad".

The "grimoire" (medieval book about magical beliefs) called "Ars Goetia", writes about 72 demons that a king has called and put in a bronze container sealed by magical symbols. The demons had to do whatever the king said. This book is all about spirits and demons, good and evil, that were called by magic. The word 'demon' has different meanings all over the world, but often there is the idea that they are spirits that lived in a place, or went with a person. 

Christians believe that demons were bad angels that went to bad ways instead of good ways. Angels were like humans, God asked them if they wanted to stay with him, or to go away from him. Those angels who became demons because they wanted to go away, fought against God, who won the battle with Michael. God sent the bad demons into a prison called Hell and they could not see God now for the punishment. Those demons are called the fallen angels. 

Some say that the demons go back to heaven after asking forgiveness of their bad doings. But others say they stay in that prison forever. The demons go into the prison also because of marrying a human woman, when they are not supposed to. The fictional "Inuyasha" has some demons marrying a human as well.

In "InuYasha", a fictional "manga", "yokais" (Japanese for supernatural creatures and translated demon in English) cannot die easily, but humans do, and "yokais" get old more slowly than humans. They are also creatures that have supernatural powers and most of them are evil. A half-demon is a child made by human and a demon married together - so it's half-demon and half-human. ( Demi God )

A daemon is a type of program found in computers running operating systems based on Unix like Linux, BSD, and Mac OS X. (In Windows these programs are usually called "services" instead.) It usually starts when the computer starts, and does useful things. Some daemons start other programs after waiting until a certain time of day, or wait for you to ask for a file from another computer. The term is a reference to Maxwell's Demon, not religion.

Central Bank bombing

The Central Bank bombing was one of the deadliest terrorist attacks of the civil war in Sri Lanka between the government and the Tamil militant LTTE group.

The attack happened on January 31, 1996, in Colombo, the capital city of Sri Lanka. A truck with about 440 pounds (200kg) of high explosives crashed through the main gate of the Central Bank, a seaside building which managed most of the financial business of the country. As gunmen and security guards were shooting, the suicide bomber in the truck detonated the massive bomb, which badly damaged the bank and damaged eight other buildings nearby.

The explosion killed 90 people and injured 1,400 others. Most of these were ordinary citizens or civilians working in the small shops set up near the bank. This bombing was followed by one in July on a train that killed more than 70.

Until 2006, the Central Bank bombing was the deadliest LTTE terrorist bombing .

<doc id="47035" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47035" title="Ledger line">
Ledger line

A ledger line is a short line used to write notes which would otherwise be too high or too low for the staff. A short line (slightly longer than the note) is drawn parallel to the lines on the staff, and the note head is placed on that line or in the space below or above it.

Notes more than two or three leger lines below the treble clef stave or two or three leger lines above the bass clef stage are rarely used. It is usually easier to change the clef.

Notes more than four or five leger lines above the treble clef stave or below the bass clef stage also become hard to read. These very high or very low notes are easier to read if an “8va” sign (called "ottava" sign) followed by little dots is placed above or below the notes. This means they are to be played an octave higher (or lower) than written.

The piccolo always sounds an octave higher than the music written and the double bass always sounds an octave lower than written. Some wind instruments also transpose up or down an octave to make it easier to read, e.g. the bass clarinet sounds a ninth (just over an octave) lower than the music which is written in the treble clef (this makes it the same fingering as the clarinet).

<doc id="47036" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47036" title="Clef">
Clef

A clef is a sign at the beginning of a staff of music which makes it possible for the player to work out what the notes are. The word “clef” is a French word meaning “key”. The original Latin word is “clavis”. It is the “key” to understanding which notes should be played. 

The staff (or “stave”) consists of five lines across the page. The notes are placed on these lines and in these spaces. The staff is only large enough to cover one and a half octaves of music (a bit more with leger lines). Therefore different clefs are used for high music and for low music.

The treble clef is drawn by starting with a circle in the middle, then going up, round and straight down with a hook at the end. The second line of the staff (counting from the bottom) goes through the middle of the treble clef’s circle. A note on this line is a G. This is why the treble clef is called a “G clef”.
The treble clef is used for high notes. The notes higher than Middle C can be written in the treble clef. In piano music the right hand is usually written in the treble clef. Music for instruments such as the violin, flute, oboe, recorder, trumpet and high singing voice are always written in the treble clef.

The alto clef is an example of a “C clef”. The middle of a C clef points to Middle C. In the alto clef Middle C is on the third line of the staff. Viola music is written in this clef, which is why it is also called the “viola clef”. Alto trombone players also need to be able to read the alto clef.

The tenor clef is another C clef. Middle C is on the fourth line up. Tenor trombone players need to be able to read the tenor clef. Cellists, Double bass players and bassoonists also need to read tenor clef when their music goes high.

The bass clef is normally used for the left hand in piano music. Low instruments like the cello, double bass and bassoon mostly read from the bass clef. It is an F clef because the two dots are on either side of the fourth line up which is an F below Middle C.

The choice of clef used depends on the music. The music for a pianist’s left hand may be written in the bass clef, and the right hand notes may be in the treble clef.

In choral music the sopranos and altos sing from the treble clef, the tenors usually sing from the treble clef but sounding an octave lower than written (shown by a small 8 below the clef), and the basses sing from the bass clef.

<doc id="47037" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47037" title="Tobin tax">
Tobin tax

A Tobin tax is a tax on all trade of currency across borders. 

The first idea that it could be useful came from the economist James Tobin. The tax is meant to put a penalty on short-term speculation in currencies. The proposed tax rate would be low, between 0.1% to 0.25%. 

On August 15, 1971, Richard Nixon told that it would no longer be possible to change the US dollar to gold, so ended the Bretton Woods system. Tobin suggested a new system for international currency stability, and proposed that such a system include a charge on foreign-exchange transactions. Professor Tobin later received a Nobel Prize in Economics in 1981.

The idea was nearly forgotten for more than 20 years. In 1997 Ignacio Ramonet, editor of "Le Monde Diplomatique", started the debate around the Tobin tax again with an editorial titled ""Disarming the markets"". Ramonet proposed to create an association for the introduction of this tax, which was named ATTAC (Association for the Taxation of financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens). The tax has then become an issue of the antiglobalization movement and a matter of discussion not only behind academic institutions but even in the streets and in parliaments around the world, such as the UK and France. 

Since one country acting alone would find it very difficult to introduce this tax, many argue it would be best done by an international institution. It has been proposed that having the United Nations manage a Tobin tax would solve this problem and would give the U.N. a large source of funding independent from donations by participating states. However, there have been initiatives of national dimension about the tax.

The Tobin tax idea was the subject of much discussion in Europe in the summer of 2001. On June 15, 2004, the Commission of Finance and Budget in the Belgian Federal Parliament approved a bill implementing the "Spahn tax" (a version of the Tobin tax proposed by Paul-Bernd Spahn). According to the legislation, Belgium will introduce the Tobin tax once all countries of the eurozone introduce a similar law.

Speculation

Speculation has a special meaning when talking about money. The person who speculates is called a speculator. A speculator does not buy goods to own them, but to sell them later. The reason is that he wants to profit from the changes of market prices. 

One tries to buy the goods when they are cheap and to sell them when they are expensive. There is a good chance to do that as long as the market price of a good changes often in different directions.

Speculation includes the buying, holding, selling, and short-selling of stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, collectibles, real estate, derivatives or any valuable financial instrument. It is the opposite of buying because one wants to use them for daily life or to get income from them (as dividends or interest).

Speculation is one of the market roles in western financial markets. The others are hedging, long term investing and arbitrage. Speculators do not plan to keep an asset for a long time.

This was designed to reduce speculation on currency markets, which he saw as unproductive. He also suggested that the money gained from the tax could be used to fund projects for the benefit of Third World countries, or to support the United Nations.

Tobin's academic work included pioneering contributions to the study of investment, monetary and fiscal policy and financial markets. He promoted and developed the ideas of Keynesian economics.

Bretton Woods system

The Bretton Woods system was the first system used to control the value of money between different countries. It meant that each country had to have a monetary policy that kept the exchange rate of its currency within a fixed value—plus or minus one percent—in terms of gold.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was created to fight against temporary imbalances of payments. The Bretton Woods system was the first monetary order that organized monetary relations among independent nation-states.

It set out the rules for commercial and financial relations among the world's major industrial states. 

Plans to rebuild the international economic system after the end of World War II started before the war ended. 730 delegates from all 44 Allies of World War II came to Bretton Woods, New Hampshire for the "United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference". The delegates discussed and then signed the Bretton Woods Agreements during the first three weeks of July 1944.

The planners at Bretton Woods set up a system of rules, institutions, and procedures to regulate the international monetary system. They started the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) (now one of five institutions in the World Bank Group) and the "International Monetary Fund" (IMF). These organizations became active in 1946 after a enough countries had ratified the agreement.

Until the early 1970s, the Bretton Woods system worked. It controlled conflict and achieved the common goals of the leading states that had created it, especially the United States.
In the face of increasing strain, the system collapsed in 1971, following the United States' suspension of convertibility from dollars to gold.

“Anti-globalization” is considered by many to be a social movement, while others consider it to be several separate social movements. In either case, participants are united in opposition to the political power of large corporations, as exercised in trade agreements and elsewhere, which they say destroys the environment, labor rights, national sovereignty, the third world, and more. 

Most people who are called "anti-globalization" prefer instead to describe themselves as the Global Justice Movement, the Movement of Movements (a popular term in Italy), the "alter-globalization" movement (popular in France), and a number of other terms.

The groups and individuals that would come to be known as the "anti-globalization movement" developed in the late twentieth century to combat the globalization of corporate economic activity and the free trade with developing nations that might result from such activity.

In logic, the truth value of a logical statement says how much it is true. Usually, the truth value can only be "true" or "false". For example, "The car is red" is true when the car is red and false when it is not.

In multi-valued logics, the truth value can be other values as well. For example, one could use a value between 0 and 1 to say how much it is true. Zero would mean that it is completely false and one would mean that is completely true. When the car is orange (half red, half yellow), the truth value could be 0.5 because the statement is half true and half false.

Boris Yeltsin

Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin () (Russian spelling:Бори́с Никола́евич Е́льцин) (February 1, 1931 - April 23, 2007) was the first President of Russia and the country's first elected leader. He served from 1991 to 1999.

Yeltsin was born in a small village near the Ural Mountains. As a boy, he lost two fingers from his left hand after he and his friends played with grenades they a stolen from an army store. Yeltsin worked as a builder, then joined the Communist Party in 1961. He was the leader of the city of Svedlovsk (now Yekaterinburg) during the 1970s. One of the things he did was demolish the building where Nicholas II and his family were shot.

In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev made Yeltsin the leader of the city of Moscow. Yeltsin became one of the more liberal members of Gorbachev's government, and he often complained Gorbachev's reforms were not doing enough. Eventually, in 1987, he had an argument with Gorbachev and ended up being kicked out. Yeltsin then became determined to get revenge. After Russia's elections in 1989, Yeltsin became leader of the Russian Parliament. It was his idea to create the office of President of Russia in the first place.

Yeltsin became the first elected leader of Russia in 1991. He won 57% of the vote. Two months later, Yeltsin became a hero across Russia when he helped stop an attack on the government in Moscow. Later that year, the Soviet Union collapsed as Russia and all 14 other divisions made themselves independent. Yeltsin won support from the United States and Europe when he promised to bring capitalism and democracy to Russia, but the 1990s were difficult times for Russia and Yeltsin was an unpopular leader while President.

In 1993, the Russian Parliament tried to remove Yeltsin from power after he tried to hold early elections. The problem got so bad that Yeltsin ended up using tanks to attack the Russian Parliament building. After he stopped Parliament, Yeltsin ruled as a dictator for a few months until a new constitution was approved by voters.

Throughout the rest of his time as President, Russia would be affected by many money problems, including inflation and corruption. Yeltsin decided to sell off many things the government had owned, such as oil and natural gas, and many government businesses, but these ended up falling into the hands of a small powerful group of billionaries, who became known as the oligarchs. In 1998, Russia suffered a large financial crisis. Yeltsin also started a war to stop the Chechnya part of Russia from breaking away.

Despite these problems, Yeltsin was reelected in 1996. His biggest opponent was a Communist, Gennady Zyuganov. Many Russians felt that if Zyuganov was elected, it would cause a civil war. But by the time he resigned on New Year's Eve in 1999, Yeltsin was so unpopular, that his approval rating was believed to be just 2%.

Yeltsin's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin took over as President. This was only temporary, but Putin was then properly elected a few months later when an election was held to decide who should replace Yeltsin.

Yeltsin struggled with alcoholism while President. This often resulted in some strange behaviour when he visited other countries. During a visit to Berlin, he grabbed a stick and tried to conduct a military band. During a visit to Washington, he was found drunk outside the White House by members of the Secret Service. He also suffered from heart attacks. 

Boris Yeltsin died of congestive heart failure on April 23, 2007.

Delete per WP:NOTABILITY - Google search for "Centre for Advanced Technologies" has no hits relevant to the article's context; article. The education notability is further questioned by the fact that the subject is in a Secondary school, rather than a University which further questions the integrity and notability of the CfAT. Finally, the article's deletion can be justified by - if the article does turn out to be worth a space on our servers, it can be added when we have all of our primary articles up to standard.

My thoughts on InuYasha character pages: There have been a number of pages on InuYasha characters added to SE lately. I would like to suggest that a single page be created called List of InuYasha characters and that the following pages be deleted and the information on them be moved to the new "List" page: Kikyo, Kagome, Naraku, Onigumo, Midoriko, Sango, Miroku, Kirara, and Shippo. I would also suggest that the information on Shikon no Tama be merged into the main InuYasha article. It seems unnecessary to have pages on each of the characters. English Wikipedia has a page for each individual character, but and I think that a list page would allow us to have the information while not dedicating too much time and energy to a topic that is not among the most important for a developing encyclopedia to have. 17:35, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

Pixel

A pixel (short for picture element) is a single point in a picture. On the monitor of a computer, a pixel is usually a square. Every pixel has a color and all the pixels together are the picture. The color of a pixel can be stored by using a combination of red, green and blue (RGB) but other combinations are also possible, such as cyan, magenta, yellow and black (CMYK).

The word "pixel" was first used in a paper by Frederic C. Billingsley in 1965. He did not create the word himself. He got it from Keith E. McFarland but Keith does not know where he got it from. Keith said that the word was in use in those days.

The word "pixel" uses "pix" as a shorter word (an abbreviation) for "picture". The word pix was first used in 1932 in Variety, a magazine. It was an abbreviation for "pictures" or movies. By 1938 the word "pix" was also used for pictures that did not move (still pictures).

The word "picture element" is even older. For example, the German word "Bildpunkt" (which means "picture point") was used in a 1888 patent of Paul Gottlieb Nipkow.

Olomouc (-Czech) is the sixth largest city in the Czech Republic. About 102,000 people live there. It is located in the center of the historical region Moravia. In the past, Olomouc was a capital city of Moravia.

There are many churches and historical buildings. There is beautiful "Holy Trinity Column" in the centre. UNESCO has this column on the list of World Heritage Sites. There is a nice astronomical clock.

Its university is the oldest in Moravia and second oldest in the Czech Republic. The university was founded in 1573 as part of effort to reestablish Roman Catholicism in the country. Roughly nine out of ten inhabitants of the Czech Crown lands were Protestants at the time.

Theobroma

Theobroma is a genus. There are about 20 species in it. They are small trees, native to the forests of Central and South America. The name translates to "food of the gods".

Their family is given as Sterculiaceae or sometimes as Malvaceae.

Some of these trees have edible seeds. Best known are perhaps the Cacao tree, the source of cocoa and chocolate. Other well-known trees are Cupuaçu, and Mocambo. 

"Theobroma" species are used as food plants by the larvae of some moths of the genus "Endoclita" including "E. chalybeatus", "E. damor", "E. hosei" and "E. sericeus". The larva of another moth, "Hypercompe muzina", feeds exclusively on "Theobroma cacao".

Cupuaçu

Cupuaçu ("Theobroma grandiflorum"), also spelled Cupuassu and Copoasu, is a tropical rainforest tree related to Cacao. Common throughout the Amazon basin, it is widely cultivated in the north of Brazil. The largest production occurs in Pará, followed by Amazonas, Rondônia and Acre.

Cupuaçu trees usually are between 5 and 15 meters (16 to 50 feet) tall. Some trees can reach 20 meters (65 feet). They have brown bark. Their leaves are 25–35 cm (10–14 in) long and 6–10 cm (2–4 in) across. These leaves have 9 or 10 pairs of veins. As they mature, their leaves change colour from pink-tinted to green. Eventually they begin bearing fruit. Cupuaçu fruits are , brown, and fuzzy, 20 cm (8 in) long, 1–2 kg (2–4 lb) in weight, and covered with a thick (4–7 mm), hard exocarp.

The white pulp of the cupuaçu is uniquely fragrant. It contains theacrine (1,3,7,9-tetramethyluric acid) instead of the xanthines (caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline) found in cacao. Cupuaçu can replace cocoa in many day-to-day foods, especially for children, such as chocolate milk. It is frequently used in desserts, juices and sweets. Cupuaçu seeds can be made into cupulate, which looks and tastes just like chocolate but is cheaper and more resistant to heat. Asahi Foods, a Japanese company, once tried to patent the production and use of Cupuaçu seed fat, but they failed.

The wood is also commonly used for timber.

Array

In programming languages, an array is a way of storing several items (such as integers). These items must have the same type (only integers, only strings, ...) because an array can not store different kinds of items. Every item in an array has a number so the programmer can get the item by using that number. This number is called the "index". In some programming languages, the first item has index 0, the second item has index 1 and so on. But in some languages, the first item has index 1 (and then 2, 3, ...).

When the programmer creates an array, he/she must give the size of the array. This is the number of items that can be stored in the array. If the programmer wants to store more items then he/she must create a new array. This is because the size of an array can not be changed.

In the programming language C, arrays can be created like this:

This creates an array of integers and it can store 5 integers. The programmer can now store integers in the array by doing:

The programmer can use a value in the array like this:

Tierce de Picardie

In music a Tierce de Picardie (meaning "Picardie's third") is a major chord at the end of a piece of music in a minor key.

In the 16th and 17th centuries this was a very common way to end a piece in a minor key. There is a scientific explanation for this. Music in the minor sounds melancholy or disturbed in comparison to the major because the third note of the scale is flattened (lowered by a semitone). In the harmonic series this minor third is the 17th harmonic which sounds dissonant against the fundamental (first note of the scale). This means that ending in the major gives a sense of relief after the tension of the minor. In a piece in A minor, for example, where the third note of the scale is C natural, in a Tierce de Picardie the final chord will include a C sharp, changing the chord from A minor to A major.

Beethoven’s "Fifth Symphony" is in C minor but the last movement is in the major. This is not a Tierce de Picardie in this case, as the term applies only when just the last chord alters. The term was introduced in 1767 by Rousseau in his "Dictionnaire de musique" (Dictionary of Music). “Tierce” means “third”, but no one knows why he called it “Picardie” (Picardy is an area in the north of France).

Bach used it fairly often in his music. The first movement of the "Concerto for Two Violins and Orchestra" is a good example. In his "Fantasia and Fugue in G minor BWV542" the fugue ends with a Tierce de Picardie and, in some editions, the Fantasie as well. It is possible that Bach would have finished the Fantasie with a major chord only if he was playing it on its own (without the fugue), but we cannot be sure of this. Another famous piece that ends in a Tierce de Picardie is Greensleeves.

Rousseau lived in the 18th century during the Age of Enlightenment. His political ideology influenced the French Revolution and aided the development of nationalism and socialist theories. Rousseau was also a composer, writing numerous books about music theory. Rousseau authored "Confessions", an autobiography, one of the first of its kind. Many later philosophers were influenced by him. He wrote a novel "Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse" which was a best-seller and influenced 19th century writers of romanticism.

Rousseau believed that men were born good and innocent, and that corruption and sadness occurred because of life experiences and experiences in society. He believed that if society was gone, man would be happy and pure once again.

Rousseau is most famous for his social contract ideology, which is often compared to the social contract of John Locke. This ideology is stated in Rousseau's book, "The Social Contract."

Real-time strategy

Real-time strategy (RTS) is a genre of computer and video games. In real-time strategy games, every player has an army to attack the other player(s). Every player has a military base and people or vehicles (these are called units). The player also has money to create new units or to build new buildings. These buildings can allow the player to do things, such as creating units or to use new technology.

The player that destroys the base and the units of the other player(s) wins.

In real-time strategy games, everything the player does, happens right away: there's no time between doing something (like telling a unit to move) and seeing it happen. This is different in turn-based strategy where the players take turns to do things.

Boston Tea Party

The Boston Tea Party was a violent protest by American colonists against King George III's rule in America. It happened on December 16, 1773.

The British government had been putting taxes on almost everything that Americans wanted to buy, including tea. The Americans had no one to speak for them in the British government. They were mad that they were being taxed by the government but had no part in how the government was run. They did not think it was right to pay taxes when they did not have a representative in the government ("No taxation without representation!"). Also merchants selling their goods would lose their profit because of the taxes. The Americans began purchasing smuggled goods, which were much cheaper.

To show how angry they were, a group of people named the Sons of Liberty dressed up as Native Americans and went onto ships in the Boston harbor. They took boxes of tea and dumped them into the water. This made the British government angry. The British government made even harder laws for the people of the Massachusetts colony. One of these laws was The Intolerable Acts which said that Boston harbor was closed until the colonists paid back all the tea they lost. The Boston Tea Party was one of the main things that started the American Revolutionary War.

Cookie

A cookie is a sweet dessert made from flour. Cookies are made in an oven. They are also called biscuits in many English-speaking countries, except for the United States and Canada.

Most cookies are flat and round like a disc. Cookies often have flavors added to them, like spices, chocolate, butter, peanut butter, nuts or dried fruits. Most cookies are very sweet. Today, many people think of cookies with warmth and love. Cookies may be used like chocolate and candy as an reward when children do good deeds.

Even though it is close to cakes and other sweetened breads, cookies usually do not use water for cohesion. Water in cakes makes the base (in the case of cakes called "batter") as thin as possible, which allows the bubbles to form better. Cookies do not have bubbles, so they do not need this. In cookies, some form of oil or fat is used for cohesion. Oils, like butter, egg yolks, vegetable oils or lard are much more viscous than water and evaporate freely at a much higher temperature than water. So a cake made with butter or eggs instead of water is more dense when cooked.

Hard wafers have been made for as long as baking existed. They were very popular because they last a long time and are not fragile, but they were normally not sweet enough to be called cookies today.

Cookies were made at first in 7th century AD Persia, just after the use of sugar became common there. They spread to Europe through the Muslim conquest of Spain. By the 14th century, they were common in all parts of Europe, and could be found anywhere from royal cuisine to street vendors.

People started to travel around the world at that time, and cookies made a good travel snack; a sweeter version of the travel cakes used throughout history. One of the most popular early cookies, which traveled very well and became known on every continent, was the jumble, a hard cookie made mostly from nuts, sweetener, and water.

Common types of cookies:



Cookies that are bought from the supermarket have a very large amount of fat and sugar.

Etruscan civilization

The Etruscan civilization was a culture in ancient Italy. The Romans named them Etrusci or Tusci. The Ancient Greeks named them Tyrrhenoi or Tyrrsenoi. The Etruscans named themselves Rasenna.

The Etruscan Civilization is very old. It began in pre-history. When it was very powerful, it was in three confederacies (areas like modern states). These three confederacies were Etruria, Latinum and the Po Valley, and Campania. The Etruscans ruled Rome until 396BC.

The Etruscan language is related to the Tyrrhenian language family and is not related to other languages. Some Etruscan letters were used by the Romans in the Latin alphabet, which English uses. When the Romans conquered the Etruscans, they wrote everything in Latin. So now we do not know much about the language. Some Romans wrote about the Etruscans and their language but it is now lost.

The Etruscans mined metals like copper and iron. They became rich and powerful and travelled around the Mediterranean Sea. The Etruscan Civilisation began to lose power in the 5th century BC. The Romans began conquering parts of Etruscan land. By the beginning of the 1st century BC, the Etruscans were entirely defeated.

Sea of Japan

The Sea of Japan or East sea is a sea in the western Pacific Ocean. It is between Korea to the west, Russia to the north and Japan to the east and south. Different countries have different names for the body of water. North Korea calls it East Korea Sea.

International Hydrographic Organization(IHO) decided to call this sea area "Sea of Japan" in 1929.

Since 1992, South Korea demands the world to use the names "East Sea" or "Sea of Korea" instead of "Sea of Japan".
South Korea argues that this sea area has been called "East Sea" since early times. It is also a Korean belief that the name "East Sea" was eliminated from the maps of the world in the early 20th century while South Korea was under the rule of Japan.
On the contrary, Japan says that the name "Sea of Japan" has been used more widely than "East Sea" in Europe and America since before the 18th century. Japan also points out that if there was no Japan, there would be no sea. Especially, the name "Sea of Japan" is also strongly spread by the extreme nationalists' politicions of right-wing parties such as Jimin party or Minshu party.

Nowdays many maps and documents include both the name Sea of Japan and East Sea, often with East Sea listed in parentheses or otherwise marked as a secondary name.

Natural environment

Natural environment means all living and non-living things that are naturally on Earth. 

In a narrow sense, it is an environment that is not influenced by human. The environment that is influenced by humans can be called "the built environment" or cultural landscape.

For some, there is a difficulty with the term "natural environment" in that nearly all environments have been directly or indirectly influenced by humans at some point in time. In order to address this concern, some level of human influence is thus allowable without the status of any particular landscape ceasing to be "natural." Many natural environments are the product of the interaction between nature and humans. For this reason, the term ecosystem has been used to describe an environment that contains nature, and includes people. It follows then that environmental problems are human or social problems. Some also consider it dangerously misleading to regard "environment" as separate from "people."

The roots of Natural Environment can be simply defined. 'Natural' can be described as something that occurs naturally, or of its own accord, on Earth. 'Environment' can be described as the surroundings of an object.

<doc id="47182" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47182" title="Natural capital">
Natural capital

Natural capital is a metaphor for the mineral, plant, and animal formations of the Earth's biosphere when viewed as a means of production of oxygen, water filter, erosion preventer, or provider of other ecosystem services. 

In a traditional economic analysis of the factors of production, natural capital would usually be understood as "land" and therefore something else than "capital" in its original sense. 

At the beginning of reflection about economics "land" was seen as something natural, but "capital" as man-made goods only. 

But the benefits which humans have from nature are many. 17 of them were closely looked at by Robert Costanza. These benefits are in some ways similar to those that owners of "capital" have as their capital produces more goods, e.g. a factory which produces automobiles just as an apple tree produces apples.

This is an approach to ecosystem valuation, an alternative to the traditional view of all non-human life as passive natural resources. But human knowledge and understanding of the natural environment is never complete, and therefore we cannot yet know what "natural capital" means exactly.

Marie Curie

Marie Skłodowska–Curie (7 November 1867 – 4 July 1934) was a physicist and chemist. She was from Poland but lived in France. She was an expert in the field of radioactivity. She was also the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. She was the first woman professor at the University of Paris as well as the first person to win two Nobel Prizes. She received their Nobel Prize in physics for her research on spontaneous radiation which was discovered by Henri Becquerel.

She was born with the name Maria Skłodowska in Warsaw, Poland. She lived there until she was 24. At the age of twelve, her mother died, and two years earlier, her sister Zofia died. In 1891, she followed her older sister, Bronisława, to study in Paris. In Paris, she got higher degrees. She also did her important scientific work. She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw. Her husband, Pierre Curie, daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, and son-in-law, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, also won Nobel Prizes.

Curie did many great things. She created a theory of "radioactivity" (a term made by her and Pierre), found different ways for separating radioactive isotopes, and discovered two new elements, radium and polonium. It was also under her own direction that the world's first studies were used into the treatment of cancers. These treatments used the radioactive isotopes. 

While being a French citizen, she never lost her Polish identity. She named the first new chemical element that she discovered (1898) "polonium". This was named after her home country, Poland. In 1932, she founded a radium institute in her home town, Warsaw. It was run by her sister, Bronisława.

A flyover is a trick that people do with planes or helicopters. The Blue Angels are a special group of pilots that do a lot of flyovers at sporting events. Doing a "flyover" usually "flying" "over" the people who are watching. Sometimes the planes fly very low to make the stunt more exciting.

In the military a flyover is when fighter jets fly over the enemy. They do this to try to scare the people they are fighting against.

<doc id="47206" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47206" title="Stuntman">
Stuntman

A stuntman is a man or a woman who performs dangerous acts usually within the television or movie production industry. In this line of work the stuntman (or woman) is paid to do those actions that are deemed too dangerous for the regular actor to perform, these include jumping from a height, falling down, being in a car crash, or pretending to fight with weapons such as swords or knives. These stunts are usually presented as a small feature within a larger production.

Action movies, war movies, martial arts movies, and crime television shows use many stuntmen to do the dangerous actions depicted in the movies or shows. Jackie Chan and the Blue Angels are examples of stuntmen who perform this kind of work.

There are, however, other stuntmen that present dangerous stunts to a live audience as entertainment in their own right rather than as part of a larger story. Sometimes these are as standalone effects and sometimes as a feature within a larger stunt show. Escape artists, sword swallowers and other circus and sideshow acts are an example of this.

These types of stuntmen can be found scattered throughout history with one of the most famous from the last Century being escape artist Harry Houdini.

Modern examples of these types of stuntmen include escape artist and stuntman Roslyn Walker and sideshow veteran Kondini both from the UK.

Stunt work is dangerous regardless of whether you work in film, television or within a live stunt show. Stuntmen are often hurt during the stunts they perform and in some cases stuntmen have even been killed.

Stunt work is not steady work. Stuntmen who work in film are only employed on a film-by-film basis, sometimes they are needed for a number of months if they are lucky to double for the lead actor but could quite easily only be needed for a single stunt that is filmed over the space of a day or two.

Within the live stunt industry work is very seasonal. A stuntman can be working long hours during the summer months, often seven days a week, but not at all during the winter period.

Stuntmen who perform for film and television often benefit from having a large safety crew present, which is in stark contrast to those who perform within live shows who often work alone and are responsible for all aspects of the stunt they perform. 

Stuntmen also have to travel to many different regions or countries to get work. For people who like to travel, this may be an advantage. However, it can also make it hard to see friends and relatives, if you are away from home a lot.

To become a stuntman, some people go to a stuntman school. There are stuntman schools in California and Florida, where professional stuntmen teach people how to do stunts. Most people do not go to school to become stuntmen, though. People learn the skills from other more experienced stuntmen. 

When a stuntman first begins working as a stuntman, they do not make much money. Once a stuntman has experience, they can ask for more money. In many countries, stuntmen have to join a union to work on film or television show productions, and pay dues (payments) to the union. There are more men working as stuntmen than women. 

Usually, a stuntman within film and television does not work as a stuntman after they become 40 years old. However those who work live stunt shows continue to do so until very late in life. Kondini continues to work as a sword swallower and escape artist despite being in his 70s. Some experienced stuntmen become stunt coordinators or consultants, who plan and devise the stunts performed in TV shows and films.

Another job for men or women in the television or movie production industry where people replace the actors is the job of body double. When a film has a scene with a love scene or a nudity scene that the actor does not want to do, the movie or television director may hire a man or a woman to be a body double. The man or woman pretends to be the actor for a short period, so that the love scene or nudity scene can be filmed.

Year 2000 problem

The Year 2000 problem (also known as the Y2K problem, the millennium bug, Y2K Bug, and Y2K) was a problem that happened because of the way in which some early computer programs were made. They were made to handle only years containing 2 digits (for example '92 instead of 1992), and people started fearing that date-related processing would happen incorrectly for dates and times after December 31 1999. It caused a big concern that very important industries (such as electricity or financial) and government functions would stop working at exactly midnight, January 1 2000, and on other critical dates which were called "event horizons". More people were panicked by press coverage and other media speculation, as well as corporate and government reports. Companies and organisations around the world had to check and upgrade their computer systems. The preparation for Y2K thus had a significant effect on the computer industry. No significant computer failures occurred when the year changed to 2000. Debate continues on whether the absence of computer failures was the result of the preparation undertaken or whether the problem had been overstated.

Peter Ham

'Peter William Ham (April 27, 1947 – April 24, 1975) was a Welsh singer, songwriter and guitarist, best known as the prominent songwriter and singer of the 1970s group Badfinger. 

Ham was born in Swansea, South Wales. He formed a local rock group called The Panthers in 1961. This group became The Iveys in 1965. The band was relocated to London by The Mojos manager, Bill Collins, in 1966, and they continued to perform for three years throughout the United Kingdom. Pete Ham especially took to songwriting and Ray Davies of The Kinks took initial interest in producing his group. In 1968, The Iveys came to the attention of Mal Evans (The Beatles personal assistant) and were eventually signed to the Beatles' Apple label after approval from all four Beatles, who were most impressed by dozens of demos recorded at home, mostly by Pete.

The Iveys changed their name to Badfinger with the single release of "Come And Get It," a song written by Paul McCartney, which became a worldwide Top Ten hit. Ham's hard work paid off eventually as his song "No Matter What" became another worldwide Top Ten hit record in late 1970 . He followed up writing two more huge hits released in 1972, "Day After Day" and "Baby Blue" But the peak came with his co-written song "Without You" - a worldwide #1 hit as covered by Harry Nilsson in 1972. The song has since become one of the all-time ballad standards as covered by hundreds of singers including Mariah Carey and Clay Aiken. Ham was also used as a musician on Beatles solo records such as the "All Things Must Pass" LP by George Harrison and the single "It Don't Come Easy" by Ringo Starr.

Egalitarianism is the belief that groups are, or should be, equal to one another. The word is named for the French word égal, meaning "equal" or "level".

There are many possible kinds of egalitarianism. For example, legal egalitarianism is the belief that groups of people should be equal in law even if they are of different race or religion. Gender egalitarianism is the idea that men and women are equally important, although they are different.

This word may be used when talking about philosophy in many slightly different ways. We can best understand the different kinds of egalitarianism by asking, "Who is equal to whom?" and "How are they equal?"

Vacheron Constantin

Vacheron Constantin is a Swiss watch manufacture. It is a part of the Richemont group since 1996. The brand's watch factory is based in Geneva. Vacheron Constantin opened 15 boutiques and 500 shops in 80 countries of the world. Vacheron Constantin is one of the oldest watchmakers. 

Jean-Marc Vacheron opened the first workshop in Geneva, Switzerland in 1755. In 1770 the company introduced the first complication (an additional function of a watch besides showing hours and minutes). 

The son of Jean-Marc Vacheron, Abraham, became the head of the family business in 1785. In 1810, Jacques-Barthélemy, the grandson of the founder continued the business. He controlled the company's exports of watches to France and Italy. 

In 1819 Francois Constantinin became the partner of Vacheron. The name of the company became – "Vacheron & Constantin". Francois Constantin traveled a lot and opened new markets for the company. The main market was North America. Francois wrote the company's motto - Do better if possible and that is always possible. It is kept till the present day.

In 1839 Georges-Auguste Leschot joined "Vacheron & Constantin". He headed the manufacturing process. Leschot's inventions brought great success to the company and watchmaking in general. Leschot invented a device that made possible mechanical production of some watch parts. It helped the company leave behind other watchmakers.

After Francois Constantin and Jacques-Barthélemy Vacheron died, the company was headed by their heirs. Since 1862 Vacheron Constantin explores the field of non-magnetic materials. In 1885, it produced the first anti-magnetic watch. The watch could resist magnetic fields. 

In 1877 the company officially changed the name for "Vacheron & Constantin, Fabricants, Geneve". The same year the company chose its symbol - the Maltese cross.In 1887, Vacheron Constantin became a stock company. 

The first Vacheron Constantin boutique was opened in Geneva in 1906. Today the store is situated on Quai de l’Ile. Charles Constantin headed the company in 1936. He led it through the Great Depression period. For the first time since 1850s a Constantin family member became the president of the company. When the World War II was over, the company got back its firm position on the watch market.

The history of Vacheron Constantin saw a lot of innovations. The brand's classic Patrimony line was started with the thinnest watch. Its case was only 5.25mm thick. In 1979 Vacheron Constantin created the most expensive wristwatch with initial price of $5 million. The watch named Kallista had 118 diamonds. Today its price is $11 million. 

At present day Vacheron Constantin produces about 20,000 watches every year. In 2003 Vacheron Constantin presented a new sports watch line - Overseas. In 2005 the company introduced a new Egérie collection. The collection included women's watches for the first time.

In 2005, Juan Carlos Torres became the Chief of the Vacheron Constantin Company. The same year Vacheron Constantin produced the most complicated wristwatch - Tour de I'lle. The watch consisted of 834 parts and had 16 complications (additional functions). Its price reached over $1 million. In 2006 the company opened a new main office in Genevan Plan-les-Ouates.

Industries use polycarbonate for making different products, from bulletproof windows to CDs and DVDs. The main advantages of polycarbonate are high strength and light weight.

Industries use clear polycarbonate to make eyeglasses. This is because it has a very good transparency and durability. Lenses made from clear polycarbonate can be thinner than lenses made from ordinary glass.

Companies that create electronic equipment use polycarbonate to create the cover of cell phones, laptops and other products. Although polycarbonate is not toxic, it needs toxic chemicals during its production phase.

Natural disaster

A natural disaster is the consequence of the combination of a natural hazard (a physical event like a volcanic eruption, an earthquake, a landslide) and human activities.

Only if humans are there where the hazard happens and if they have no sufficient emergency management, there will be human losses. Therefore one can say: "disasters occur when hazards meet vulnerability" . A natural hazard will therefore have no natural disaster as a result in areas without vulnerability, that means if for example a strong earthquake is in uninhabited areas.

International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is established to do help at emergency including natural disaster by Geneva Conventions, and Article 11 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities also difines such help by international law both humanitarian and human rights.

Landslide

A landslide includes a wide range of ground movement, such as rock falls, deep failure of slopes and shallow debris flows. 

The biggest reason for a landslide is always that there is a slope and material goes down the slope because of gravity. 

But other things also contribute to landslides: 

An underlying reason is the nature of the material. For example, a thixotropic material such as mud or sand and water, can change from a gel to a sol by adding water or pressure, or shaking. It goes from being stable one minute to fluid the next minute. The greatest disasters, like lahars or mudslides, happen suddenly. It is possible for much of a volcano to just slide down suddenly, as with Toba, Krakatoa and Mount St Helens.

Debris

Debris in a general sense means man-made garbage. 

The average American produces garbage, also called trash, at the rate of four pounds per day per person, which translates to 600,000 tons per day, or approximately 220 million tons per year. This is almost twice the rate of trash generation per person as most other major countries. Trash levels can be reduced primarily by recycling, re-use, and reduced consumption.

Waste heat

Waste heat is the by-product heat of machines and technical processes for which no useful application is found. 

A fraction of input energy is always converted to heat by friction between machine parts and other processes such as liquid friction (see: viscosity). 

Mechanical drives can be designed to run smoothly, with little loss of energy to heat. Machines for conversion of energy contained in fuels to mechanical work or electric energy produce large amounts of waste heat (see: Second law of thermodynamics). 

This waste heat can be re-used if a cogeneration system is used. It is hard to use waste heat because it is difficult to transport the heat to another place, and it is difficult to store the heat for use at another time.

Kingda Ka

Kingda Ka is a steel roller coaster at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey, USA. It is the tallest and was the fastest roller coaster until Formula Rossa and 1 of 2 strata coasters. It goes up and can go . It first opened on May 21, 2005. To get up 456 feet, the train is launched by a machine to 128 miles per hour in 3 seconds. The train goes up the tower, and back down. At the bottom the train goes over a hill while it is slowing down. Soon it is going slow enough to be able to arrive safely back where it started. The ride lasts 59 seconds.

In the past it has been struck by lightning and shut down for almost a whole year. Also the launch cable snapped and they shut down for a while. Something happened to the braking fins so they shut down the ride. It also can get shut down by weather. The train is made so that if it rolls back it gets placed back for launch. This happens when the hydraulic launch system does not get enough power to get over the hill or the brakes on the top off the hill stop you too much. In Top Thrill Dragster it once got stuck at the top. 

Kingda Ka is named for a 500 pound mythical tiger. A tiger in the safari was named after the roller coaster. It is surrounded by bamboo to make it look more real. It also plays music.

4 trains that hold 18 people each 9 rows 2 to a seat. Shoulder harnesses and buckles to keep the shoulder harness down make sure passengers are safe. At the top, passengers are weightless for 1 second, and the beautiful view is followed by a drop.

Vulnerability

Vulnerability means the extent to which changes can hurt or harm a person or a system.

In context with natural hazardss and natural disasters, "vulnerability" is a concept that looks at the relationship that people have with their environment and at social aspects.

So it links environment to social forces and institutions and the cultural values that sustain and contest them. “The concept of vulnerability expresses the multidimensionality of disasters by focusing attention on the totality of relationships in a given social situation which constitute a condition that, in combination with environmental forces, produces a disaster” (Bankoff et al. 2004: 11).

Complex definition: Vulnerability is the susceptibility to physical or emotional injury or attack. It also means to have one's guard down, open to censure or criticism; assailable. Vulnerability refers to a person's state of being liable to succumb, as to persuasion or temptation (see Thywissen 2006 for a comparison of vulnerability definitions).

<doc id="47342" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47342" title="Liquid crystal display">
Liquid crystal display

A liquid crystal display is a special thin flat panel with a number of pixels in front of a light source. Each pixel is filled with liquid crystals that are capable of showing many colors or one color only. The technology they use is called electro-optical modulation. Liquid crystal displays are often abbreviated LCDs. Liquid crystal displays are often used in battery-powered devices, because they use very little electricity. 

Each pixel of a LCD is typically made of a layer of molecules which are aligned between two transparent electrodes. There are also two polarizing filters, one on each side. These two filters are perpendicular to one another. This means that without the liquid crystals between them, they would block all light from passing through – the light passing through the first filter is polarized in such a way that the second filter blocks it.

The surface of the electrodes that are in contact with the liquid crystal materials are treated so that they align the liquid crystal molecules in a particular direction. This treatment typically consists of a thin polymer layer that is unidirectionally rubbed using, for example, a cloth. The direction of the liquid crystal alignment is then defined by the direction of rubbing. Electrodes are made of a transparent conductor called Indium Tin Oxide (ITO). 

Before applying an electric field, the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is determined by the alignment at the surfaces. In a twisted nematic device (still the most common liquid crystal device), the surface alignment directions at the two electrodes are perpendicular to each other. The molecules therefore arrange themselves in a helical structure, or twist. This reduces the rotation of the polarization of the incident light, and the device appears grey. If the applied voltage is large enough, the liquid crystal molecules in the center of the layer are almost completely untwisted and the polarization of the incident light is not rotated as it passes through the liquid crystal layer. This light will then be mainly polarized perpendicular to the second filter, and thus be blocked and the pixel will appear black. By controlling the voltage applied across the liquid crystal layer in each pixel, light can be allowed to pass through in varying amounts – this will yield different levels of gray.
The optical effect of a twisted nematic device in the voltage-on state is far less dependent on variations in the device thickness than that in the voltage-off state. Because of this, these devices are usually operated between crossed polarizers such that they appear bright with no voltage (the eye is much more sensitive to variations in the dark state than the bright state). These devices can also be operated between parallel polarizers, in which case the bright and dark states are reversed. The voltage-off dark state in this configuration appears blotchy, however, because of small variations of thickness across the device.

Both the liquid crystal material and the alignment layer material contain ionic compounds. If an electric field of one particular polarity is applied for a long period of time, this ionic material is attracted to the surfaces and degrades the device performance. This is avoided either by applying an alternating current or by reversing the polarity of the electric field as the device is addressed (the response of the liquid crystal layer is identical, regardless of the polarity of the applied field).

When a large number of pixels are needed in a display, it is not technically possible to drive each directly since then each pixel would require independent electrodes. Instead, the display is "multiplexed". In a multiplexed display, electrodes on one side of the display are grouped and wired together (typically in columns), and each group gets its own voltage source. On the other side, the electrodes are also grouped (typically in rows), with each group getting a voltage sink. The groups are designed so each pixel has a unique, unshared combination of source and sink. The electronics, or the software driving the electronics then turns on sinks in sequence, and drives sources for the pixels of each sink.

The researches on liquid crystals began at the end of the 19th century but the first publication on this topic was made in 1904 by Otto Lehman and after this first publication there followed a series of other related articles, which described the same topic.

LCD displays use two pieces of glass, which contain a solution of liquid crystals between them. When an electric current passes through the solution the crystals align in such a way that light cannot come through them.

LCD displays have matrixes, which build up a colored picture. There are two types of matrixes: "active" and "passive". The simpler, passive matrix types, can be found in electronic wrist watches and pocket calculators. Active matrix devices are more complex and use thin film transistors (TFT). TFT images are as sharp as the images from the older CRT displays. On the other hand, they are more expensive, but are extensively used in producing LCD computer monitors and TV panels. 

Main features of an LCD monitor are:


Additional types are:

Plagiarism is copying another person's ideas, words or writing and pretending that they are one's own work. It can involve violating copyright laws. College students who are caught plagiarizing can be kicked out of school, and writers who plagiarize will often be taken less seriously.

When writing papers, many students practice plagiarism without knowing it by using other people's ideas without citing them (saying where they got them). Reading another article or book and taking an idea from it and putting it into one's own words is not plagiarism if the writer of the paper says where they got the idea.

Black metal

Black metal is a extreme style of Heavy metal that started in the early 1980s. Lyrics are often against religions such as Christianity. Various black metal bands have relations to satanism in their lyrics and even in outlook. Lyrics may also have subjects such as Paganism. The majority of black metal vocalists are male, although there are a few notable exceptions – for example Cadaveria, Astarte and Lucifugum.

Black metal is often divided into two waves. The first wave began in the early 1980s by bands such as Venom, Bathory, Hellhammer, Celtic Frost and Mercyful Fate. Venom's first albums, Welcome to Hell and Black Metal are usually said to be the first black metal records. Second wave is the most popular wave of black metal and it started in the early 1990s. It started from Norway and includes bands such as Darkthrone, Enslaved, Burzum, Satyricon, Mayhem, Gorgoroth, Immortal, and Emperor.

Black metal is also very controversial, especially in Norway. During the early 1990s, certain black metal musicians burned old churches in Norway. One of the people who was found guilty for burning churches, Varg Vikernes, was also found guilty for murdering Øystein Aarseth, a fellow black metal musician.

National Socialist black metal (also known as Nazi black metal or NSBM) is a title used to refer to black metal acts with an emphasis on Nazi beliefs in their music. For example Absurd and Nokturnal Mortum are National Socialist black metal bands.

Harthacanute

Harthacanute (Canute the Hardy, sometimes "Hardicanute, Hardecanute"; Danish: "Hardeknud") (1018 – 8 June 1042) was King of Denmark from 1035 to 1042 and England from 1040 to 1042. He was the only son of Canute the Great and Emma of Normandy.

He followed his father as King of Denmark in 1035, becoming Canute III. Fighting with Magnus I of Norway stopped him from sailing to England to take up his throne. His older, illegitimate half-brother, Harold Harefoot, became regent of England.

Harold took the English crown for himself in 1037. After Harthacanute had settled the situation in Scandinavia he prepared an invasion of England to take over his kingdom. Harold died, and Harthacanute was able to take back his throne peacefully.

Harthacanute was a and unpopular ruler: to pay for his ships, he greatly increased the rate of taxation. In 1041 the people of Worcester killed two of Harthacanute's men who had been collecting the tax. Harthacanute burned the city. The story of Lady Godiva riding naked through the streets of Coventry to persuade the local earl to lower taxes, may come from the reign of Harthacanute. The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" says of him: "He never accomplished anything kingly for as long as he ruled". 

In 1041, Harthacanute asked his half-brother Edward the Confessor (his mother Emma's son by Ethelred the Unready) back from exile in Normandy to become a member of his household, and probably made Edward his heir. Harthacanute was unmarried and had no children. On 8 June 1042, he died at Lambeth— he "died as he stood at his drink, and he suddenly fell to the earth". He was buried at Winchester Cathedral, Hampshire. Edward became the new king.

He was said to be the son of Canute the Great, King of England, of Denmark, of Norway, some of Sweden, by his wife Aelgifu of Northampton, although there was some skepticism that he was Canute's son.

Upon Canute's death (November 12, 1035), Harold's younger half-brother Harthacanute, the son of Canute and his queen, Emma of Normandy, was legitimate heir to the thrones of both the Danes and the English, but was unable to travel to his coronation, because his Danish kingdom was under threat of invasion by King Magnus I of Norway and King Anund Jacob of Sweden. Therefore he was installed temporarily as regent though Godwin the Earl of Wessex and the Queen were against it.

Harold died at Oxford on March 17, 1040, just as Harthacanute was preparing an invasion force of Danes, and was buried at the abbey of Westminster.

English Interregnum

The English Interregnum was the period of parliamentary and military rule in the land occupied by modern-day England and Wales after the English Civil War. It began with the execution of Charles I in 1649 and ended when Charles II became king after Oliver Cromwell died in 1660.

This era in English history can be divided into four periods.

Oliver Cromwell was a Puritan and during the Interregnum, he imposed a very strict form of Christianity upon the country. Although a main cause of the English Civil War was oppression under Charles I, England during the Interregnum became oppressive in its own fashion. Cromwell granted religious freedom otherwise previously unknown in England, but other forms of expression were suddenly limited (for instance, theatre, which had thrived under the Stuart kings and Elizabeth I, was banned). Cromwell also made certain that his own personal vision of Christianity was enforced upon the masses. Many of Cromwell's actions were called "harsh, unwise, and tyrannical" by some commentators. 

His son and successor, Richard Cromwell gave up his position as Lord Protector with little hesitation, resigning or "abdicating" after a demand by the Rump Parliament. This was the beginning of a short period of restoration of the Commonwealth of England.

Interregnum

An interregnum is a period between monarchs, between popes of the Roman Catholic Church, emperors of Holy Roman Empire, Polish kings (elective monarchy) or between consuls of the Roman Republic. It can also refer any gap in the continuity of a government, organization, or social order.

In some monarchies, such as the United Kingdom, an "interregnum" is usually avoided due to a rule described as "the king is dead, long live the King", i.e. the heir to the throne becomes a new monarch immediately on his predecessor's death or abdication. This famous phrase signifies the continuity of sovereignty. This is not so in other monarchies where the new monarch's reign begins only with coronation or some other formal or traditional event. 

An "interregnum" occurs also upon the death of the Roman Catholic Pope, though this is generally known as a "sede vacante" (vacant seat). The interregnum ends immediately upon election of the new Pope by the College of Cardinals.

Oliver Cromwell

Oliver Cromwell (April 25 1599–September 3 1658) was an English military and political leader best known for making England a republic and leading the Commonwealth of England. 

Cromwell's actions during his career seem confusing to us today. He supported Parliament against the King, yet he ordered his soldiers to break up parliament. Under his rule, the Protectorate said that people's religious beliefs should be respected, but people who went against what most people believed were sometimes tortured and imprisoned.

Cromwell was the first ruler of England to be a Puritan.

Cromwell started off as an ordinary man from Huntingdon. He became an MP and a Puritan and supported Parliament in its quarrel with the King. When war broke out, the King's army was stronger and better-prepared than the army of Parliament. Cromwell saw this, and he decided to train men to fight better. Soon the "New Model Army" he had trained began to win battles. As a result, Parliament won the war. By the end of the war, Cromwell was very powerful.

After the execution of the King, a republic was declared, known as the Commonwealth of England. A Council of State was appointed to manage affairs, which included Cromwell among its members. His real power base was in the army.

A new constitution known as the Instrument of Government made Cromwell Lord Protector for life. He had the power to call and dissolve parliaments. 

In 1657, Cromwell was offered the crown by Parliament. Cromwell reflected for six weeks over the offer. Then he rejected it and was ceremonially re-installed as "Lord Protector" (with greater powers than had previously been granted him under this title) at Westminster Hall.

Cromwell is thought to have suffered from malaria (probably first contracted while on campaign in Ireland). He died at Whitehall on 3 September 1658, the anniversary of his great victories at Dunbar and Worcester.

He was succeeded as Lord Protector by his son Richard. Although Richard was not entirely without ability, he had no power base in either Parliament or the Army, and was forced to resign in the spring of 1659, bringing the Protectorate to an end. A year later Parliament restored Charles II as king. 

When the Royalists returned to power, Cromwell's corpse was dug up, hung in chains, and beheaded.

Cyrillic alphabet

The Cyrillic alphabet (pronounced 'sih-ril-ic') is a native Slavic alphabet. Now it used to write Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Rusyn, Bulgarian, Macedonian and for all Serbo-Croatian languages. It was required by the Soviet Union for many non-Slavic languages in the Caucasus, Siberia and in northern Russia. Here are letters of the Cyrillic alphabet, in upright and italic (slanted) shapes:

The Cyrillic alphabet was invented in the 9th century by Clement of Ohrid, who was taught by two monks named Kyrillos and Methodios. Clement named his alphabet after his teacher "Kyrill" (Latin "Cyrillus"). It is based on the Greek alphabet. Before the invention of the Cyrillic alphabet, Slavic people used the Glagolitic alphabet.

Nymph (biology)

In science a nymph is the young of some kinds of insects.

Insects grow in two ways. In one of these ways, called "incomplete metamorphosis", an insect egg hatches, and a small insect called a nymph comes out. The nymph usually looks just like the adult insect but is much smaller. Nymphs do not become pupae before becoming adults.

Some insects have nymphs that are aquatic, which means they live in water. These nymphs look very different from the adults. Dragonflies have nymphs that live in water, such as in lakes and rivers. Nymphs that live in water are sometimes called naiads.

The other way insects grow is by "complete metamorphosis". This way has no nymphs.

Some insects that are nymphs when they are young are grasshoppers, cockroaches, true bugs, and dragonflies.

In mythology (what people believed a long time ago), spirits of nature are called nymphs. Water spirits are called naiads in mythology.

The Protectorate

In British history, the Protectorate was the period 1653–59 during which the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland was governed by a Lord Protector.

Before the Protectorate, England (and then Scotland and Ireland) had been ruled directly by Parliament since it had in 1649. The Rump Parliament had been sent away in April 1653 by soldiers led by Oliver Cromwell. Although the replacement, the Barebones Parliament (July–December 1653), was nominated by Cromwell and the leaders of the army, it was just as difficult to control.

The post of Lord Protector was created by a constitution passed in December 1653. Cromwell got this position for life. Although the constitution divided power between the Lord Protector, the Council of State and Parliament, in practice there was again the strong executive power that had been absent since the end of the monarchy. Cromwellian government has been called ‘one of the first experiments in ("de facto") military dictatorship’ (Abbott). 

During the Protectorate there was Puritan legislation. Religious toleration was extended to Jews and most Protestants, but not to Anglicans or Roman Catholics. 

After Cromwell's death in September 1658, the new Lord Protector, Richard Cromwell, was unable to control the army and resigned in May 1659. After a chaotic ‘interregnum’, the monarchy was restored in May 1660, through the initiative of General George Monck.

Vibrator (sensual)

A vibrator is a device that is made to vibrate against the body (including insertion in a body cavity), thereby stimulating the nerves and giving a pleasurable and possibly erotic feeling.

The electrically powered vibrator was invented in the 1880s by doctors, who were treating women for "hysteria" for centuries by performing what today would be considered masturbation. At the time, however, not only did doctors regard the "vulvular stimulation" required as having nothing to do with sex, they reportedly found that it took a lot of time to do and it was hard work. The vibrator did it more quickly and easily, and because of this it was very popular with doctors. Home versions soon started being made and they were also popular, with adverts in places like "Needlecraft", "Woman's Home Companion", "Modern Priscilla" and the Sears, Roebuck catalog. These disappeared in the 1920s, apparently because their appearance in pornography made it no longer tenable for polite society to avoid the sexual connotations of the devices.

In their more common guise as "body massagers", millions of vibrators have been sold to both men and women. Some of the people that buy vibrators only use them to relieve them of muscular tension or aches and pains. However, many people who purchase vibrators marketed as "body massagers" — and, presumably, most people who purchase vibrators marketed as adult toys — use them to get sexual pleasure, most often in masturbation, a form of autoeroticism. Vibrators often allow people to achieve orgasm faster and easier and are often said to provide stronger orgasms than those produced by hand stimulation alone. They are often recommended by sex therapists for women who have difficulty reaching orgasm by other means. Couples also use them sometimes as an enhancement to the pleasure of one or both partners. 

Harper's magazine notes a Durex survey that says 46% of women have vibrators near 2006. This may have been market research relating to their vibrating condom base product.

The sale of vibrators and similar "novelty items" is forbidden in several states in the southern United States. In the state of Texas, the sale of devices for sexual stimulation such as vibrators and dildos is technically illegal, but many stores will sell such items provided that the customer sign a statement that the device will be used only for educational purposes. The states of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Indiana, Virginia, Louisiana and Massachusetts also have laws that prohibit vibrators.

An enormous range of vibrators exist, falling into several broad categories:

Most vibrators use internal batteries, but some of them have a power cord and must be plugged into a power socket to work.

History of England

England is the largest of the countries that today make up the United Kingdom. The name "England" comes from the Anglo-Saxons who arrived in the 5th century. The territory of England has been united as one country since the 10th century. This article is about the history of that territory until 1707, when Britain (England and Wales) was joined with Scotland to make Great Britain. 

Archaeology shows that people came to southern England long before the rest of the British Isles, probably because of the friendly climate between and during the ice ages of long ago. 

Julius Caesar invaded what is now England in 55 and 54 BC, and wrote in "De Bello Gallico" that there were many tribes there, who were very similar to other Celtic tribes in Europe. Coins, and later Roman historians, have given us the names of some of the rulers of the tribes, and what they did. 

For hundreds of years, what is now England was a Roman province, Britannia. The Romans later gave up on the province and left the Celtic people on their own as the Roman Empire began to fall apart. The influence of the Romans meant that the territory of England had already experienced unity before the Anglo-Saxons arrived.

After the Romans left around 410, England was settled by waves of Germanic peoples (Anglo-Saxons).

Jutes, together with large numbers of Frisians, Saxons from northern Germany, and Angles from southern Denmark - often called "Anglo-Saxons", began to invade Britain in the mid-5th century. They were tribes led by royal chiefs, and they settled on the eastern and southern shores.

Analysis of human bodies found at an ancient cemetery near Abingdon, England, shows that Saxon immigrants and native Britons lived side-by-side. 
The Romano-British population (the Britons) was assimilated. The settlement (or invasion) of England is called the Saxon Conquest, or the Anglo-Saxon or English Conquest.

From the 4th century AD, many Britons left across the English Channel from Wales, Cornwall and southern Britain, and started to settle the western part of Gaul (Armorica), where they started a new nation: Brittany. The Britons gave their new country its name and the Breton language, Brezhoneg, a sister language to Welsh and Cornish. The name "Brittany" (from "Little Britain") arose at this time to tell the new Britain apart from "Great Britain". Brezhoneg is still spoken in Brittany today.

Beginning with the raid in 793 on the monastery at Lindisfarne, Vikings made many raids on England.

After a time of raids, the Vikings also began to settle in England and to trade, eventually controlling an area called the Danelaw from the late 9th century. One Viking settlement was at York, called Jorvik by the Vikings. Viking rule left traces in the English language — because Old English was already related to Old Norse, many Norse words began to be used in English at this time.

The defeat of King Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 against Duke William II of Normandy, later called William I of England, and the following Norman conquest of England caused important changes in the history of Britain. William ordered the Domesday Book to be written. This was a survey of the entire population, and their lands and property, to help in collecting taxes.

William also ruled Normandy, then a powerful duchy in France. William and his nobles spoke, and held court, in Anglo-Norman, in Normandy as well as in England. The use of the Anglo-Norman language by the aristocracy was kept up for centuries, and had a great influence on the development of English.

In England, the Middle Ages was a time of war, civil war, rebellions from time to time, and many plots among the nobles and royalty. England had more than enough cereals, dairy products, beef and mutton. The nation's international economy was based on the wool trade, where wool from northern England was sold to the textile merchants of Flanders to make into cloth. Medieval foreign policy was also shaped by relations with the Flemish cloth business. An English cloth business was developed in the fifteenth century, allowing the English also to become wealthier. 

In the reign of Henry II, the king got some power back from the barony and the Church. Henry's successor, Richard I "the Lion Heart", took part in the Third Crusade, and defended his French territories against Philip II of France. His younger brother John, who followed him as king, was not so lucky; he lost Normandy and many other French territories. In 1215, the barons led an armed rebellion and forced him to sign the Magna Carta, which put legal limits on the King's personal powers.

The reign of Edward I (1272–1307) was rather successful. Edward strengthened the powers of his Government, and called the first English Parliament. He conquered Wales. His son, Edward II, lost the Battle of Bannockburn against Scotland.

The Black Death, an epidemic that spread over all of Europe and parts of Asia, arrived in England in 1349 and killed perhaps up to a third of the population. 

Edward III gave land to powerful noble families, including many people with royal blood. Because land was like power in these days, some powerful men could now try to claim the Crown.

The Wars of the Roses ended with the victory of Henry Tudor, who became king Henry VII of England, at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, where the Yorkist king, Richard III was killed. 
His son, Henry VIII split with the Roman Catholic Church over a question of his divorce from Catherine of Aragon. Though his religious position was not entirely Protestant, this led to the Church of England breaking from the Roman Catholic Church. There followed a time of great religious and political troubles, and the English Reformation.

Henry VIII had three children, all of whom would wear the Crown. The first to reign was Edward VI of England. Although he was intelligent, he was only a boy of ten when he took the throne in 1547. 

When Edward VI died of tuberculosis in 1553 Mary I took the throne when crowds cheered for her in London, which people at the time said was the largest show of affection for a Tudor monarch. Mary, a loyal Catholic who had been influenced greatly by the Catholic King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, tried to get the country back to Catholicism. This led to 274 burnings of Protestants, which are recorded in John Foxe's "Book of Martyrs". She was highly unpopular among her people then. Mary lost Calais, the last English possession on the Continent, and became even more unpopular (except among Catholics) at the end of her reign. 

The reign of Elizabeth returned a sort of order to England in 1558. The religious question that had divided the country since Henry VIII was put to rest by the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, which set up the Church of England in much the same form it has today. 

The slave trade that made Britain a major economic power began with Elizabeth, who gave John Hawkins permission to start trading in 1562. 

The government of Elizabeth was more peaceful, apart from the revolt of the northern earls in 1569, and she was able to lessen the power of the old nobility and expand the power of her government. One of the most famous events in English military history was in 1588 when the Spanish Armada lost against the English navy, commanded by Sir Francis Drake. Elizabeth's government did much to make her government stronger, and to make common law and administration more effective throughout England.

In all, the Tudor period is seen as an important one, leading to many questions that would have to be answered in the next century during the English Civil War. These were questions of how much power the monarch and Parliament should have, and how much one should control the other.

Elizabeth died without children who could take the throne after her. Her closest male Protestant relative was the king of Scotland, James VI, of the house of Stuart, so he became James I of England, the first king of the entire island of Great Britain, although he ruled England and Scotland as separate countries.
The English Civil War began in 1642, mainly because of conflicts between James' son, Charles I, and Parliament. The defeat of the Royalist army by the New Model Army of Parliament at the Battle of Naseby in June 1645 destroyed most of the King's forces. The capture and trial of Charles led to his beheading in January 1649 at Whitehall Gate in London. A republic was declared, and Oliver Cromwell became the Lord Protector in 1653. After he died, his son Richard Cromwell followed him in the office, but soon quit. The monarchy was returned in 1660, after England had a time of anarchy, with King Charles II again in London.

In 1665, London was hit with the plague, and then, in 1666, the capital was burned for 5 days by the Great Fire, destroying around 15,000 buildings.

In 1689, the Dutch Protestant William of Orange, replaced the Catholic King James II in what is called the Glorious Revolution. However, in Scotland and Ireland, Catholics loyal to James II were not so happy, and a series of bloody revolts followed. These Jacobite rebellions continued until the mid-18th century, when Charles Edward Stuart was defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746.

The First Act of Union made Scotland, England and Wales into one county. The history of England after this 1707 Act is a part of Great Britain's history.

Anglo-Saxons

The Anglo-Saxons were people living in England from the mid-5th century AD to the Norman conquest of 1066.

They spoke Germanic languages and are identified by Bede as the descendants of three powerful tribes, the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. 

Their language, "Anglo-Saxon" or Old English, came from West Germanic dialects and transformed into Middle English from the 11th century. Old English was divided into four main dialects: West Saxon, Mercian, Northumbrian and Kentish.

The Anglo-Saxons displaced the Celtic tribes which had lived all over the British Isles. However, they never got to Wales, Scotland or Ireland, so their original tribes were more or less undisturbed.

There is a debate as to the how much Anglo-Saxon migration there was from the 4th century to the 6th century.
The first theories said large numbers of Anglo-Saxon settlers arrived, basically killing or moving the British people living in south and east of Britain. Such an idea is supported by the language related and place-name evidence. In terms of language, Old English became the language of the English kingdoms, but a few Celtic words became part of the language. 

More recently the focus has shifted towards continuity, trying to place Britain in the context of European Late Antiquity. Some of this argument is based on scale. The population of Britain in 400 is unknowable, but is carefully guessed, based on land usage, to have been around 2 million people. It is thought to be unlikely that such a large population was all together killed or displaced between the 5th century and sixth century. Much of the argument for continuity is based on archaeological evidence.

The indigenous British people, who wrote in both Latin and Welsh (a Celtic language), referred to these invaders as "Saxones" or "Saeson" – the latter is still used today in the Welsh word for English people; In the Scottish Gaelic the word for English people, "saesonach"; and in Irish the word for English people, "Sasanach".

Anglo-Saxon art before roughly the time of Alfred (ruled 871–899) is a fusion of Anglo-Saxon and Celtic techniques and motifs. The Sutton Hoo treasure is an exceptional survival of very early Anglo-Saxon metalwork and jewellery, from a royal grave of the early 7th century.

The period between Alfred and the Norman Conquest, with the revival of the English economy and culture after the end of the Viking raids, saw a distinct Anglo-Saxon style in art, though one in touch with trends on the Continent.

Anglo-Saxon art is mainly known today through illuminated manuscripts. Manuscripts were far from the only Anglo-Saxon art form, but they have survived in much greater numbers than other types of object. Contemporaries in Europe regarded Anglo-Saxon goldsmithing and embroidery as especially fine. Perhaps the best known piece of Anglo-Saxon art is the Bayeux Tapestry which was commissioned by a Norman patron from English artists working in the traditional Anglo-Saxon style. The most common example of Anglo-Saxon art is their coins. Anglo-Saxon artists also worked in fresco, ivory, stone carving, metalwork and enamel, but few of these pieces have survived.

Old English literary works include genres such as epic poetry, biography, sermons, Bible translations, legal works, chronicles, riddles and others. In all there are about 400 surviving manuscripts from the period.

The most famous works from this period include the poem "Beowulf", which has achieved national epic status in Britain. The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" is a collection of important early English history. "Cædmon's Hymn" from the 7th century is the earliest attested literary text in English.

Norman conquest of England

The Norman conquest of England was a military invasion of England by William the Conqueror in 1066.

William was a Duke who ruled Normandy, now a region in France. He invaded England after the death of King Edward the Confessor because he believed he had the most right to be King of England. But King Harold II had himself crowned king instead. King Harold, with his Saxon army, and Duke William fought at the Battle of Hastings on October 14 1066. King Harold was killed in the battle and his army left. On December 25 1066 William was crowned the new King of England.

The "Norman conquest" brought an important change in English history for a number of reasons. The conquest linked England more closely with Continental Europe, and made Scandinavian influence less important. It created one of the most powerful monarchies in Europe. The conquest changed the English language and culture, and set the stage for rivalry with France, which would continue (with breaks) until the 19th century. England has never been successfully invaded since the Norman invasion nearly 1000 years ago.

English Reformation

The English Reformation was part of a process and movement of thought, referred to as the Protestant Reformation, which led to the breaking away of a number of Christian churches in Europe from communion with Rome. 

Each of the countries that went through this process did so in a different way, so the process in England was singular. Earlier the church had supreme powers. They had several malpractices,which included the selling of "Pardons" which when bought with money would make God forgive him. But then Henry VIII snapped ties with the Roman Catholic Churct and he became head of the English church by what was called the Royal Supremacy and that was the beginning of the Church of England,although he remained a Catholic. For the first few years, the Church of England was almost exactly the same as the Catholic Church, except that it was ruled by the King instead of the Pope. 

There were several causes for the English Reformation. One of these was that Henry VIII, who was King of England, want to divorce his wife, Catherine of Aragon. Another reason was because Henry wanted to control the lands that belonged to the Church. The Church was rich. Henry thought that if he was in power of the church he would be richer (and gain power).

Why do no articles have references? George Washington, Napoléon Bonaparte, Charles Darwin, Star, and others. Thank you, - 23:13, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

I think we should impose a minimum number of edits (say, 50) on anything where there is voting involved. This is to discourage sockpuppetry. What are your opinions? -- 02:49, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

There are several pages (May 2004) that are variations of the basic year pages (2004). Should these pages all be consolidated into their appropriate year pages? I am thinking "yes", but thought it best to get a more general opinion on the subject. -- 07:35, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

This week's topic to focus on is 'Buildings and structures'; it has been that since the beginning of March (my fault, I forgot all about it). How about we place that box on the recent changes notice as well as on the community portal?

Also, how about we have a 'current project' at times when there's really big things to get out of the way (eg cleaning up a section of our ). If we have these on the recent changes notice, people won't forget about them (at least I won't) and I think we could get massive jobs done incredibly fast. - 12:26, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

I noticed on that there are only thirteen administrators on this Wikipedia. I went to to see if I could find anything about minimum requirements before nominating, but there seriously isn't much there. I was wondering if people could post here what their own personal standards are when looking at adminship candidates. 17:31, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

There is an error on , and it could probably be reworded to be simpler anyway. It says "There two edit boxes below." when it should probably say "There "are" two edit boxes below.". 18:04, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

I hope to automate a lot of this process through scripts, eg an online spellchecker, readability tests, wordlist lookup tools, and simpler things like direct links to save typing for searching Commons and other projects.

I copied Template:Babel over from English Wikipedia. Now users can write "<nowiki></nowiki>" and have Babel boxes on their user pages to tell people which languages they speak. I did this for Simple English Wiktionary, too. If there is no box for your language, go to English Wikipedia or another Wikipedia and copy it. Copy a page like "Template:User fr-3" from English Wikipedia to Simple English Wikipedia and then there will be a box for your language. To copy, click "edit this page" on English Wikipedia but don't change the page. Use your computer mouse to copy it. If you can't easily copy with a computer mouse, ask someone to do it for you. On Simple English Wikipedia, search for "Template:User fr-3" or the language box you are looking for. If it says there is no page, it will say you can create the page. Create the page and put the computer words from English Wikipedia there.

Template:Babel looks like just words, but really it has computer words to tell the computer how to make boxes. To make Babel boxes work on another Wikipedia, copy "Template:Babel" to the other Wikipedia. (Use "edit this page".) Also copy "Template:User en" and "Template:User en-3" and other templates like that. Then it will work. -- 01:25, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

I just took a look at Simple English . I had misunderstood it! It is a worthwhile project! It is not about collecting quotes in Simple English. It is about collecting quotes in English (or maybe other languages?) and explaining them in Simple English. This is a worthwhile project! But there is a proposal to close it down at ! 

The reason Simple English Wikiquote is worthwhile is that many people may not understand some famous quotes in English and can benefit from Simple English explanations. Some people voting to close it down say that there's no use collecting quotes in Simple English. They just don't even understand that the project is not about collecting quotes in Simple English! 

Others say that if someone doesn't understand a quote in English, they should read a translation of it in their own language. They fail to understand two things: first, that there are many people who can read Simple English but can't read any other language (or not well enough to understand translations of those quotes). This includes some children, some adults who can understand ordinary English but are baffled by expressions like "come what come may" or archaic terms in some famous quotes, many deaf people who have difficulty learning to read because their own language has no written form and they can't hear the sounds that make alphabets meaningful; and other people. Also: if someone is learning English, an explanation in Simple English of a famous quote would help them understand the quote without switching back to their own language; switching back can interfere with learning a new language. -- 03:08, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

Hi. Are commercial links allowed from personal home page?
Example Brass parts ,Brass fittings and India animations 

Next election I want to try to become a sysop. Even though it is early I am going to start to run for it now, even though I am not a canidate yet. I think I will be a great sysop because I have a lot of free time to be here, will be tough on vandalism, and am not tolerant of people being rude. If you have anything to ask me ask me on my talk page please. Have a nice week and god bless.-- 20:22, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

I just nominated myself to be a sysop. I believe we should give vandals one warning, and if the vandaliz again block them for at least 2 weeks, we need to get vandals off wikipedia. If that person vandals again ban him from using wikipedia. If someone is rude give that person a warning, and if he is rude again block him for at least 3 day's, so they can cool down. After the first block every time a person is rude I would block him with no warning. I will protect a user page if that person asks me too. Have a nice week.-- 20:56, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

When I become a sysop I will ask other sysops how long they think that person should be blocked.

How often are and looked at? I reported an IP yesterday, and nobody has commented on it yet; and administrators have been deleting pages and making edits since I posted a request on . 14:56, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

Enough said.

I understand that we are a small project but I still think that we need wikiprojects like on wikipedia. The projects that I think we need are Wikiproject Religion, Wikiproject Science, Wikiproject Politics, and Wikiproject History. The wikiprojects will have members, articles that need to be made, and articles that need to be improved. On wikipedia I did not know what to write about and the wikiprojects I'm a part of helped me out. -- 18:50, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

I am involved in a couple of WikiProjects on the English Wikipedia. IMHO, the Simple Wikipedia, at this time, does not have the number of users needed to make individual WikiProjects work. There are, however, a number of things that could be considered. 

1) Doing Simple Wikipedia-wide collaborations and similar projects (?). If these work well, then consider doing more focused efforts, such as .

2) Consider creating some sort of structure for finding editors with similar subject interests. It could be something like the notice boards on the main English-language Wikipedia, or it could be just categories (with optional Babel-like templates?). ) and/or ?.)

3) Try recruiting some editors from some of the most active WikiProjects on the main English-language Wikipedia for collaborations. You could, for example, identify a core group of articles on animals that need work, and then ask for help from w:Wikipedia:WikiProject Tree of Life (and its numerous subprojects). I would suggest starting off slowly by doing quarterly interwiki collaborations. For three months, you would try to improve important articles on animals, and then for the next three months, it might be articles on countries (recruiting help from editors for the WikiProjects for each country).

I think some links to a few help pages should be added to so that people might create more encyclopaedic articles. and seem like good ones to add. This a good idea? 20:45, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

Where is the logo file? (URL) -- 04:30, 8 December 2006 (UTC)


I think could be simplified a bit, and removing the bold on the block message might make it look better.

Thoughts? 16:39, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

Even though Wikipedia isn't censored for minors, I think we should draw the line somewhere. For example, on the masturbation page, there is image there (at the time of this comment) that is outright pornography, even if it is within the scope of the article. I'm leaving it there for now, but we need to draw the line of what we allow on this site. 02:20, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

This is s serious question - editing this board is very technically difficult especially for light posters, so many rules and things to learn. So how do you manage to stay so polite and helpful in the face of such utter and complete incompetence by the general community of wanna-be editors? Is there a special wiki-college out there where trolls and vandals are trained to be responsible adults and turned into nice admin folk? Does this require brain surgery as well? 12:26, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

Can IPs be admins before creating an account, or do we have to create an account? This is what haunts me. -- 19:50, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

When new users come here, they often do not know where to start. Useful things that this wikipedia needs (and that strangely, few people want to do):





use the other items proposed in the sections in the community portal. 

Wikipedia is not about how many articles there are. It is about the quality of the articles.

Why can't we upload any images here and why don't you put copyright? You are just as capable of deleting and licensing like en. Why can't you have it here? Is there a reason? -- 00:46, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

Unless there is a problem with the links I have added to , could an administrator please remove the "change this message" from ? Thanks. 13:08, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

Could somebody "please" pipe the links in ? Undo summaries look don't look to hot and are unnecessarily long when the default undo summary is used. 21:28, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

Do you need some articles related to these two topics? 23:04, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

I would really like to beef up the science portion of this wikipedia but suck at organising myself, and have no idea what "core" topics should be done first. It would be nice if I could get some people to work with me on this and give feedback on where we should focus. I also think some of the science pages though simply written for the sake of language, are too simple to clearly give an impression of the topic they are talking about. Simple doesn't have to mean stupid! The only page I've had a go at is Nuclear_fusion and I have no idea if this is the correct level of English to use or accurate enough to give an impression of the true science :< Anyone who is allready working on science articles on here that wants to boss someone around and see their own goals met, please just leave me some talk on my en.wikipedia talk page hope to hear from you lovely people! 22:59, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

Hi, we run a network of education websites in Ireland and I saw how Answers.com worked with Wikipedia to provide Wiki-referenced content on their pages. Does anyone know is there a process to approach Wikipedia to set this up? I can't find any info anywhere..

Thanks

Kevin

Can we/ should we (in is it technically possible, and morally feasible) block the uploading of any content? - I deleted about 45 image uploads yesterday; all of them were also in commons. People should upload to commons, not to here. Hence it would be good to block the uploading of content, if this is technically possible.

What are the community's tohughts on this? -- 14:45, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

There are not infobox of any type. How can we create them?-- 14:58, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

Hi, it has been a long time since I was editing here. Is there a page or guideline on how to write in Simple? I hope I can add more techniques to the page. Thanks 23:33, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

Hello Community.

The article on Medical emergency used to have a list in it, on what to do in the case of such an emergency. The list was removed, based on the observation, that English Wikipedia has a policy that pages should not give advice or instructions on what to do, in a certain situation(). A revert of mine caused a dilemma. Please also see . While such a policy is good in many cases, I can see it doing only harm here. There are situations, where a fast reaction is important (Heart attack is another such example). In my opionon, it should be discussed, what policies from (any/en) wikipedia to apply here. If they are to be applied, they should be moved over; and clearly marked as applying. En wikipedia has about 100-150 times as many articles, as this project. It is clear that in a bigger project more rules are needed than in a smaller one.

A last thing. While this item is being discussed, please do not edit/revert such pages as to take out/put in the information. It fills up the edit log, and is much easier to do once a decision has been reached.

-- 19:24, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

We just hit 13,000 articles today. The 13,000th article was (and I got this by counting backward in the log) Prune. Thanks to everybody who has helped us get this far. Cheers, 04:19, 27 December 2006 (UTC)


Hi all. I've noticed that in some pages, the navigation bar on the left has the phrases "New changes", "Show any page", etc. instead of the English Wikipedia's "Recent changes", "Random page" etc. However, on some pages, such as Pi, I see that the original wording is used. Why is that? 22:56, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
Okay, thanks. 07:00, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

I was wondering how to create a redirect page. Specifically, I'd like to redirect District of Columbia to Washington, D.C.. This would be really helpful to know since so many pages are still blank. Thanks! 20:23, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

Checksum

A checksum is a number. It is a kind of redundancy check. There are different ways to calculate it. It serves as a check, that no errors have been made when writing down the number. In its simplest form, the digits are simply added up. This can however not detect errors of swapping digits around. Better ways (algorithms) of calculating a checksum are a Hamming code, or a cyclic redundancy check. One of the uses of checksums is account numbers. The Swiss postal account, for example, has checksum built in. Another place where checksums are used are serial numbers for computer software.

National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam

The National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF), was a communist army based in South Vietnam that fought against the governments of South Vietnam and the United States during the Vietnam War (1955-75). The group is better known as the Vietcong ("Việt Cộng") or V.C., short for "Vietnamese Communist." American soldiers called the Vietnamese communist forces Charlie, no matter whether North Vietnamese or Vietcong.

The group was made up of people from both South and North Vietnam. The Vietcong used guerilla warfare, including terrorist bombings, assassinations, and ambushes. The group is best-known for the Tet Offense, an assault on many South Vietnamese cities staged in February 1968. The group was closely allied with the government of North Vietnam, which conquered the South in 1975.

NATO phonetic alphabet

The NATO phonetic alphabet is a way of using words to replace letters. Although it is called a "phonetic alphabet" because it is used so no one gets confused when saying letters, it does not have the same reasons as the International Phonetic Alphabet or other phonetic alphabets. The first letter of the word is the letter the word stands for. This is done to help make speech easier to understand at times when it is important to be understood such as in the military and in air travel. There have been many different phonetic alphabets over time. On board ships, flags are known as these letters, and each have their own meanings. Different countries also have different phonetic alphabets.

This is the phonetic alphabet that is used most often today:
Numbers are also in the phonetic alphabet. The English numbers 0 through 8 are written and spoken the same. The number 9 is written the same, but it is pronounced "niner".

Super Mario Bros.

Super Mario Bros. is a video game made by Nintendo in 1985. It is played on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) console. The game is the sequel to the game "Mario Bros.". In "Super Mario Bros.", Mario goes in the Mushroom Kingdom. There he must save Princess Toadstool (later Princess Peach) from Bowser. Players also can use Luigi during two-player mode. The game was made by Shigeru Miyamoto. The music was made by Kōji Kondō.

"Super Mario Bros." was a very important game because it changed how games were made later. It was the best-selling video game ever before being beat by "Wii Sports" in 2009. It turned Mario into a famous symbol. It also made the NES successful. That game greatly helped the video game industry.

Bowser has kidnapped Princess Toadstool, Mario's girlfriend. And Mario must chase Bowser though eight worlds in the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue her, with the help of his brother, Luigi

"Super Mario Bros." is a platform game. In the game, Mario must race through the Mushroom Kingdom and save Princess Toadstool (later Princess Peach) from Bowser. Mario jumps, runs, and walks across each level. The worlds are full of enemies and platforms, and open holes. If Mario touches an enemy, he dies. If he falls down a hole or misses a jump, he will also lose a life.

Mario has several "power ups". A red and white Mushroom will make him big. When Mario is big, and if he touches an enemy he gets smaller; he will not die. If Mario is big and he hits a question block that has a power-up, a fire flower will come out. The fire flower will give him the power to throw fire balls, which can kill enemies. If he gets hit as Fire Mario, he will go back to being small Mario.

Each world is divided into four levels. Some levels are underground and others are underwater. When Mario is underwater, he cannot jump on any enemy and he will shrink or die if he touches one.

The fourth level is a castle. Mario faces lava, fire bars, and other enemies in this level. At the end of the level is Bowser, who stands over a lava pit. Mario can throw fireballs to defeat Bowser. He can also jump over or run under Bowser to an axe. Touching the axe will destroy the bridge and cause Bowser to fall into the lava, killing him. Toadstool's servant, Toad, will then tell Mario that the princess is in another castle. The eighth boss is the real Bowser and instead of Toad, the Princess is there.

"Super Mario Bros." was both the launch game and the killer game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. This game and "Duck Hunt" was bundled with every NES sold and the game sold 40 million units as a result.

Barbarian

In Ancient Greece, the name "βάρβαρος", "bárbaros", was given to all those who did not speak the Greek language. Later, the term Barbarian came to mean 'Anyone who is not Greek'. Later again, it meant 'anyone who is outside the Roman Empire'.

In modern use, the word is used to refer to an uncivilized or uncultured person. 

It is used for a member of a nation or ethnic group which is seen as having a lower level of civilization, or for an individual person which is seen as a brutal, cruel and insensitive or whose behaviour is unacceptable in the civilized society of the speaker. When used for a person the word is always pejorative, when used for a nation not always.

<doc id="47551" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47551" title="Numerical digit">
Numerical digit

Numerical digits are the number text characters used to show numerals. For example, the numeral "56" has two digits: 5 and 6. In the decimal system (which is base 10), each digit is how many of a certain power of 10 are needed to get the value. The rightmost, or units digit, is for 10^0, the next digit is for 10^1, etc.

Hence, the numeral "56" means:  6*10^0 + 5*10^1 = 6*1 + 5*10 = 6 + 50.

The ten digits of the decimal system are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Some numeral systems need more than ten digits. For example, the hexadecimal numeral system uses 16 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.

<doc id="47558" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47558" title="Evanescence">
Evanescence

Evanescence is a rock band from the United States. The band was formed in Little Rock, Arkansas by singer/pianist Amy Lee and Ben Moody in 1995. The band's first album is "Fallen", which was released in 2003. It was very successful and sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. Evanescence also won two Grammy awards in 2004 for their work on "Fallen". In 2006, they released a second album, "The Open Door", which sold more than 5 million copies worldwide.

Amy Lee recently wrote on the band's website that they are making a new album, which should be released October 2011. Evanescence recently has a new single "What you Want" now available to the public.

The people who founded Evanescence are singer, songwriter and pianist Amy Lee and guitarist and songwriter Ben Moody who is no longer a member in the band. They met in a youth camp in 1994, when Moody heard Lee playing a song on the piano.

After that, they started writing music together. Two of their songs were played on the local radio station and the listeners wanted them to do a concert. They later appeared live and became a popular act in their area.

They chose "Evanescence" as a name for their band because Lee thought "it is mysterious and dark, and places a picture in the listener' mind." Evanescence means "to disappear" or "to fade away".

Before "Fallen" was released, Evanescence made two EPs ("Evanescence EP" and "Sound Asleep EP") and one Demo CD called "Origin". Some of the songs on "Fallen" can be found on their previous records, like My Immortal.

Three of Lee and Moody's friends joined the band. They were John LeCompt, Rocky Gray and Will Boyd. The three also worked on previous Evanescence songs. The band also signed their first major label in early 2003 and started working on "Fallen".

"Fallen" became a worldwide success, and spent 43 weeks on the Billboard top 10 charts. It sold over 15 million copies and was certified 7x platinum in the United States. It is also one of the eight albums to stay for at least a year within the Billboard Top 50 charts.

Their most successful single from "Fallen" is Bring Me to Life, which won a Grammy award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 2004. Another popular single is "My Immortal", which was nominated for a Grammy in 2005. The other two singles are Going Under and Everybody’s Fool. All four songs had videos to promote them.

Ben Moody left the band while they were touring in Europe. The reason given for this is because of creative differences with the band’s singer Amy Lee. Moody was replaced by another guitarist, Terry Balsamo.

In 2004, Evanescence released Anywhere but Home, their first live album. It includes a concert in Paris, some behind-the-scenes features, and the single "Missing", which reached #1 in Spain. The CD also had three live songs, "Breathe No More", "Farther Away", and the band's cover of Korn's Thoughtless.

Will Boyd left the band in 2006 for "not wanting to do another big tour" and for wanting "to be close to his family". He was replaced by Tim McCord.

"The Open Door" is the band's first album to reach #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. The album had four singles with videos, which are Call Me When You're Sober, Lithium, Sweet Sacrifice and Good Enough. In 2007, Evanescence was nominated for a Grammy award for "Sweet Sacrifice".

The band toured two times to promote "The Open Door". The first tour was held in countries such as the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia. In the second tour, they returned to the US and had more concerts there. They also joined the Family Values Tour 2007 with the band Korn and the Argentinean festival Quilems Rock 07 with the bands Aerosmith and Velvet Revolver. 

On May 4, 2007, John LeCompt said that he was fired from Evanescence, and that Rocky Gray left the band. They were replaced for some time by Will Hunt and Troy McLawhorn, who are from the band Dark New Day.

Amy Lee wrote on the band's website that they are working on a new album. She said that the next album will be "Better, stronger and more interesting". It will be released on October 11, 2011.

<doc id="47559" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47559" title="Parliament of England">
Parliament of England

The Parliament of England was the legislature of the Kingdom of England. Its roots go back to the early medieval period. It took over more and more from the power of the monarch, and after the Act of Union 1707 became the main part of the Parliament of Great Britain, and later the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

The origin of Parliament can be found in the times of the Anglo-Saxons. Anglo-Saxon kings were advised by a council known as the "Witenagemot", to which belonged the King's sons and brothers. 

The Ealdormen, or executive heads of the shire and the senior clergymen of the state, had seats as well. The King still had the highest authority, but laws were made only after seeking the advice (and, in later times, the consent) of the "Witenagemot".

The royal council slowly grew into a Parliament. The first time the word "Parliament" can be found in official documents was during Henry III's reign. It was still mostly informal, and not an official body. The right to vote in Parliamentary elections for county constituencies was the same everywhere in the country, giving a vote to everyone who owned the freehold of land to a rent of 40 shillings a year (Forty-shilling Freeholders). 

The rise of Parliament's power was slowed down by civil war between Stephen and Empress Matilda. By the end of the Wars of the Roses, the king had the strongest authority again. The Crown was at the height of its power during the reign of Henry VIII. 

The great struggle between the Crown and Parliament happened under James I's successor, Charles I. The House of Commons sent Charles the Petition of Right, demanding to have their rights again, in 1628. Though he accepted the petition, he later closed Parliament and ruled without them for eleven years. It was only after he had money problems as a result of war, that he was forced to call Parliament so they could authorise new taxes. The new Parliament was quite rebellious, so the king shut them down after only three weeks; this was called the Short Parliament. But this did not help the king with his money problem, so he realized that he would need to call another Parliament. Their struggle for power with the king led to the English Civil War. Those supporting the Parliament were called Parliamentarians or 'Roundheads'. In 1649, Charles was put to death by the Rump Parliament and replaced by the military dictator Oliver Cromwell. After Cromwell's death, however, the monarchy was restored in 1660. 

Following the Restoration, monarchs agreed to regularly call Parliament. But there was no clear guarantee of Parliamentary liberties until James II, an unpopular Catholic ruler, was forced to flee the country in 1688. Parliament decided that he had given up his crown, and offered it to his Protestant daughter Mary, instead of his Catholic son. Mary II ruled together with her husband, William III.

Following the Treaty of Union in 1707 twin Acts of Parliament passed in, respectively, the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland created a new Kingdom of Great Britain and dissolved both parliaments, replacing them with a new Parliament of Great Britain based in the former home of the English parliament.

United States Bill of Rights

The Bill of Rights is the name for the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution, which limit the power of the federal government and guarantee citizens of the United States certain rights. The amendments were written in 1789 by James Madison, and were based on important ideas about personal rights. The Bill of Rights went into effect in 1791, when 3/4 of the states agreed that they were fair. Originally, the Bill of Rights had 12 different amendments, but the first two were not passed by enough states. The second amendment that was not passed was eventually added to the Constitution in 1992. It is now the 27th Amendment to the Constitution, and deals with pay changes for the government.

Radcliffe has won many awards including the BBC Sports Personality of the Year, Laureus World Comeback of the Year, IAAF World Athlete of the Year, AIMS World Athlete of the Year (three times) and a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE).

Radcliffe is an asthmatic sufferer who has voiced her opposition to the use of drugs in sport. She is married to her coach, Gary Lough, and has two children. Radcliffe is the great niece of Charlotte Radcliffe, who won an Olympic silver medal in the 1920 Games.

Radcliffe's father was a keen marathon runner as a young man. He took up the hobby again in an attempt to lose weight after giving up smoking. Despite suffering from asthma Radcliffe took up running at the age of seven as she watched her dad. During her father's training jogs in the woods Radcliffe and her brother would often run with him. In 1992 Radcliffe discovered that she suffers from anaemia. Radcliffe was diagnosed with exercise induced asthma at the age of 14. Radcliffe attended Frodsham Athletic Club until the age of nine. When Radcliffe became a member of Bedford & County Athletics Club. There she was coached by Alex Stanton. Stanton started to coach Radcliffe at the age of 12 after his wife Rosemary spotted her talent. At the age of 10 Radcliffe and her father, watched Ingrid Kristiansen run in the London Marathon. This motivated her to become an athlete. Radcliffe's first race at a national level came as a 12 year old in 1986. She finished in 299th place in the English Schools Cross Country Championships. In 1991 Radcliffe won the English Schools 1,500 metres title.

Starting 2002 Radcliffe won her opening race of the year at the Campaccio Internazionale. Radcliffe defeated Margaret Okayo by nine seconds. Radcliffe was chosen to defend her cross country world title in Dublin. Radcliffe went to first road race of 2002 was the World's Best 10K, to race in a field which included Tulu. There she just missed out on the world record. At the World Cross Country Championships in Dublin, Radcliffe chose to run only over the long distance. She chose this due to the lack of time between that and the marathon. Radcliffe's race was made easier when Wami, Tulu and then Berhane Adere decided not to take part. Radcliffe became the first woman in ten years to retain the title. 
In 2001 Radcliffe stated that she wanted to move up in distance to the marathon. She said that her first race would be the 2002 London Marathon. Before the race Radcliffe said that she worried about drinking enough water. Radcliffe's battle with Tulu would continue at the marathon. Tulu told Radcliffe that she would have to break the British record to beat her. The week before her first marathon proved to be eventful for Radcliffe. First she she had an accident with Marian Sutton. Secondly Radcliffe was confronted with a loose horse on her final training run. Radcliffe also had treatment on a knee injury. In her first race at the marathon, Radcliffe pulled away from the field at Cutty Sark. She finished 3 minutes clear of second placed Svetlana Zakharova. Radcliffe set a Course record and the World Best for a woman's only marathon. Radcliffe said after the race that the knee injury almost caused her to miss the World Cross Championships. 

Radcliffe was set to race on track for the first time in 2002 at the European Cup running in the 5,000 metres. But Radcliffe did not race as she was ill. Radcliffe decided not to take in the marathon at the Commonwealth Games, but decided to run over 5 or 10 thousand meters. Radcliffe missed the British Grand Prix with an illness. She returned over 3,000 metres in Monaco. In her return to the track, Radcliffe was beaten in to second place but set a new Commonwealth Record. Radcliffe chose to run the 5,000 metres at the Commonwealth Games. But she felt it may have been a mistake as she would have to beat Edith Masai. The task was made easier when she did not have to take part in any races before the final. For Radcliffe, it was ninth time lucky as she won her first track title. Radcliffe set a personal best. Breaking the Games record by a minute and coming close to the world record. Masai finished second. Radcliffe decided to run the 10,000 metres at the European Championships. There she broke the 16-year-old European Record. But was upset not to go under 30 minutes as she finished 300 metres ahead of the field. Radcliffe decided against the 5/10 thousand double as she wanted to focus on the Chicago Marathon. Radcliffe put her success on the track down to the marathon making her stronger and able to complete her race plans. 

At the Nike 10k in Richmond Park, Radcliffe set a new British record. She broke the old record which had stood for 13 years over 10k. Radcliffe then headed to Chicago to take on the only woman to have gone faster than her in the marathon, Catherine Ndereba. Radcliffe was 89 seconds inside the old time and finished over two minutes ahead of Ndereba to set a new world record. Afterwards, Radcliffe said that she almost gave up on the record as she wanted to go to the toilet. After the race Radcliffe said that she wanted to focus on the track during 2003. 
Radcliffe was chosen as the athlete of the year by the British Athletics Writers' Association. She was also named the IAAF athlete of the year. Radcliffe became only the eleventh woman to win the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award. Radcliffe was given over 600,000 votes making her the first woman in over 10 years to win the award. Radcliffe thanked everyone who voted for her. She also stated that her main target of 2003 would be the 10,000 metres at the 2003 World Championships. 
Radcliffe said that the heat would not be an issue during the marathon at the Olympic Games in Athens. The race was meant to start at 6 pm local time. Radcliffe started the race as the favourite. The British team said that she did not have a calf injury unlike some reports. After in the lead group Mizuki Noguchi pulled away and Radcliffe was unable to respond. Radcliffe, after struggling on a steep hill recovered and pulled herself into second place. But she was passed by Ndereba and Elfenesh Alemu. After , in fourth place, Radcliffe slowed down to a stop. She attempted to restart before sitting on the side of the road crying. After the race Radcliffe said that she was devastated. The next day Radcliffe said that she was did not know what had happened. But did know that she had 'nothing' in her legs after 15-20 km. Radcliffe said that she felt like she had let everyone down. Radcliffe was watched by 10.7 million people in the United Kingdom. She had been part of a group who wanted a 6am start. Instead of a 6 pm start time which was used to suit the American and Japanese broadcasters. A few days after the marathon, Radcliffe believed that she had made a full recovery from the event. But many of her friends did not want her to run as they felt she was not ready. In the 10,000 metres Radcliffe stopped with 8 laps to go after dropping from the lead group at halfway stage. Radcliffe was watched by 12.4 million viewers in the UK and said that she had no regrets. Radcliffe was then set for a long break. Writing in the "Telegraph", Radcliffe said that she had a Quad injury which kept coming back. She also had a very rare collection of blood outside of her vains on the underside of the muscle. The drugs that Radcliffe took to fix the problems led to her having a sick stomach. They also made her very weak. Radcliffe also said that she was touched by the hundreds of kind letters she had received. But Radcliffe was unhappy with the media who had made up stories about her personal life. 

Radcliffe has often made comments about drugs in sport. Radcliffe backed the IAAF after Olga Yegorova was caught using drugs. Radcliffe and team-mate Hayley Tullett caused trouble in the heats of the 5,000 metres at the 2001 World Athletics Championships. They held up a sign protesting against Yegorova. Yegorova had been caught using, EPO, but was allowed to race. The sign was made by Radcliffe's husband and said 'EPO Cheats Out'. It was taken off them by the stadium officials. But not before it was seen on television. Team mates Kathy Butler and Hayley Yelling also demonstrated in the final. They were seen wearing Radcliffe masks and held up signs, one of which said 'Free Paula'. Radcliffe said after the Championships that she would continue her fight against drugs in sport. Radcliffe wears a red ribbon when racing to show her support for blood testing as a method of catching drugs cheats. Radcliffe first wore the ribbon at the 1999 European Cup. This was encouraged by Blandine Bitzner-Ducret. At the end of 2001 Radcliffe was given the choice not to race against Yegorova in televised meetings in the United Kingdom.

During Radcliffe's highly successful 2002 season, foreign media, were convinced that she was taking drugs. But Radcliffe asked UK Sport to reveal her drugs tests. They showed that she had been tested five times and on each occasion was clean. Radcliffe said she was unhappy with the whispers coming from French newspaper L'Equipe. She asked for the IAAF to conduct random blood and urine samples before the Chicago marathon. She also asked them to freeze the samples so when tougher testers are developed they can prove that she ran clean.
Paula Radcliffe was born to Peter and Pat Radcliffe. She was born on the 17 December 1973 in Cheshire. Radcliffe is the great-niece of 1920 Olympic Silver medalist Charlotte Radcliffe. Radcliffe has a brother. Martin. He is two years younger than her. Radcliffe's family moved to Oakley in Bedford when she was 11. Radcliffe achieved four A levels at grade A in French, German, Maths and General Studies, while at school. Radcliffe had a choice between Loughborough and Cambridge for University. She chose Loughborough. In 1996 she finished her degree a few months early so she could prepare for the Olympic Games. Radcliffe often turns one language into another language for the IAAF.

Radcliffe met her husband Gary Lough at Loughborough University. At University Radcliffe studied French, German and economics. She left university with a first-class honours degree in modern European studies. Lough and Radcliffe married in 2000. They have two children. In 2007 they had their first child, Isla. Their second child, Raphael, was born on 29 September 2010. But had to be resuscitated as he had his Umbilical cord wound round his neck. Radcliffe first said of wanting to start a family in.

In the 2002 Queen's Birthday Honours, Radcliffe was awarded an MBE.
In October she was given her MBE saying; "It means a great deal to me, it's a great honour and it really tops off an amazing year. To come here and receive this and to meet the Queen at the end of it just finishes it off perfectly." Radcliffe became the first Britain in 2006 to win the Abebe Bikila Award. At the end of 2010 Radcliffe was voted England Athletics athlete of the decade.

Human migration

Human migration means any movement by humans from one locality to another (migration), often over long distances or in large groups. Humans are known to have migrated extensively throughout history and prehistory. 

International migration is the movement of people between countries. 
Some leave their home countries voluntarily and some are forced to leave. They hope to find a job, better climates, access to hospitals, schools and entertainment. Some want to be with friends and relatives but others are forced to leave the country because of religious and political persecution, wars, racial discrimination, famine, or natural disasters.
These people are refugees, they move to other countries hoping to find help and asylum. Most refugees are illegal immigrants and more than half are children and women. They live in extreme poverty, lacking food, shelter, clothing, education and medical care.

Rural-urban migration is the movement from country areas to towns and cities. There are many reasons why people leave the countryside. In some areas there is overpopulation, resulting from high birth rates and starvation. Mechanization has caused a reduction in jobs available in the countryside. Farming is hard work with long hours and little pay.
In developing countries a lack of money means a lack of machinery. Natural disasters such as droughts, hurricanes, floods and volcanic eruptions destroy villages and crops. There is a lack of services like schools and hospitals in the countryside.

People move to the city because they are looking for better paid jobs and expect to be housed more comfortably and to have a higher quality of life. They have a better chance of services such as schools, medical treatment and entertainment. People are often also attracted by the advantages of a cosmopolitan lifestyle such as shops, restaurants, theatres and nightlife.

Reality is very different. Though as many new arrivals to the city are unlikely to have much money, they will be unable to buy or rent a house, even if one was available. They will probably have to make a temporary shelter using cheap or wasted materials.
A lot of migrant workers’ children are also struggling to get a decent education.

In the new country they often are not integrated and are treated like an underclass. But they are needed in the cities even if the local population doesn’t like immigrants because they compete for the same jobs.
More people means more traffic and more crime. But in fact they help to build up cities, provide cheap labour, invest money, buy products and services, pay tax and help companies compete.
The government should support immigrants because they are very important for the economy of a country.

"See Proto-Indo-Europeans."
The movement of populations in modern times has continued under the form of both voluntary migration within one's region, country, or beyond, and involuntary migration (which includes slave trade, Trafficking in human beings and ethnic cleansing). The people who migrate are called migrants, or, more specifically, emigrants, immigrants or settlers, depending on historical setting, circumstance and perspective.

In medicine, malignant is a clinical word that is used to describe an illness that kills a patient fast. A malignant tumor is a tumor that is able to invade nearby tissues and spread to tissues that are not nearby. Not all patients diagnosed with malignant tumors die, because of the improved treatments available. The actual prognosis depends of the type of tumor, its differentiation, and how bad the disease is. The term malignant is typically applied to neoplasms that show aggressive behaviour characterised by local invasion or distant metastasis.

Jackie Chan Hiu-ki (陳曉琪), also known as Kellyjackie (born 23 August, 1986), is a Hong Kong citizen who enjoys singing as a hobby. She is also a member of a band called the Royals. She likes the pop singer Kelly Chen, so she puts "Kelly" in her nickname.

She was a secondary school student before 2005. She started to put her songs on the Internet from the age of 13, although she mostly sang other singers' songs. After about one year, she started writing her own songs. Her own first song was "Lucky Voice" which, like her other songs, was put on the Internet for others to listen.

In January 2005, she wrote the song "He invites me to Disneyland" (他約我去迪士尼) to ease her exam stress. She got the ideas of the song from the story Sleeping Beauty.

She uploaded her song "He invites me to Disneyland" to her band's forum, her Xanga site, i010.com and also cmidi.com for free downloading by Internet users. The song became very famous with the help of the Internet within a few weeks. The song was also number 1 of Yahoo! Hong Kong's Top Searches (搜尋人氣榜) for some time. Some DJs also played the song on the radio. Many people were happy about her, although some also thought she did not have good singing skills.

When the Hong Kong Disneyland opened, the "Hong Kong Disneyland -The Grand Opening Celebration Album" (香港迪士尼樂園開幕紀念大碟) was sold in public. Kellyjackie and Kelly Chen sang "He invites me to Disneyland" together in the album.

<doc id="47602" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47602" title="European Parliament">
European Parliament

The European Parliament (formerly European Parliamentary Assembly or Common Assembly) is the parliament of the European Union (EU). EU citizens elect its members once every five years. Together with the Council of Ministers, it is the law-making branch of the institutions of the Union. It meets in two locations: Strasbourg and Brussels.

The Parliament is made up of its 785 members, called "MEPs". Each member speaks for an area of Europe, for example London, Denmark or Scotland. Anyone can be elected, they are elected by all the EU citizens, the people who are citizens of a country in the EU. People have been elected to Parliament since 1979, before that they came from the Parliaments of each country. Because MEPs come from lots of countries, they all speak different languages (23 in 2007). This means that the Parliament has to have lots of interpreters.

Unlike other international groups of politicians, MEPs do not sit in groups of countries, but they sit next to people who they share ideas with. The two largest groups are the "European People's Party-European Democrats" and the "Party of European Socialists". But these groups work together to agree, so they do not fight and try to make a law if the other does not like it.

The European Parliament's power depends on which area of the EU it is working in. The EU has three areas, the "Community", its representation to other countries, and things to do with police and courts. In the last two areas, it can not do much as the Council takes care of those issues, but in the Community (which is the largest area) it can change or stop any law. But the Council also has to agree, and sometimes they disagree and cannot make a law.

While Parliament can change a law, it cannot start a new one, it has to ask the European Commission to do that. The European Commission works on everyday work and the Parliament has to make sure it does its job properly, if it does not Parliament can make them all leave their jobs or not allow them to spend the EU budget.

When the Parliament wants to make something a law, they all vote at the same time. But before then they make lots of small changes while talking about with people who know lots about what it will change. They do this in small meetings known as "Committees" which have between 28 to 86 MEPs in it.

The Parliament has a President. The President is elected by the MEPs, two times every two and a half years, to organise the meetings and speak for the Parliament when meeting other leaders. The president right now (2008) is a German called "Hans-Gert Pöttering", the first one (after the first election) was a French woman called "Simone Veil".

The Parliament was made in 1952 and was then called the "Common Assembly". At this time, it did not have any power, it was only asked to comment on laws made by the "European Coal and Steel Community". In 1957, it was renamed the "European Parliamentary Assembly" and got to comment on the laws of the "European Economic Community" and the "European Atomic Energy Community". Over the following years, it was given a few powers over laws and money and it called itself the "European Parliament" in the 1960s. It wanted to be elected so it could do more, as if people voted for the people in Parliament, the Council and Commission would have to pay more attention to it (this is known as "Democratic Legitimacy", the idea that your voice is worth more if you have lots of people supporting from an election).

In 1979 it held its first election, and it gained more powers and also members because more countries joined the Communities and they elected people as well. In 1993 it was given even more, and power over the Commission, when the European Union took the place of the Communities. It is now known as one of the most powerful Parliaments in the world.

Council of the European Union

The Council of the European Union is one of the three organisations that manage the European Union. Along with the European Parliament, it is responsible for law making for the European Union (EU).

Its members are the government ministers of the member countries who are responsible for the law that is being discussed. As an example, suppose the law is going to be about farming, then the Agriculture Ministers are the Council for that day. 

As well as making laws, they can meet to discuss their problems. For example, the European Union does not decide on tax - each country decides on its own tax. But the Finance Ministers meet anyway because sometimes they can help each other catch people who do not want to pay tax.

The Council is called different things in different countries, according to the language they speak. In (French it is "Le Conseil de l'Union Européenne", in German it is "Rat der Europäischen Union", in Czech it is "Rada Evropské unie". 

A simple way of putting it, is that The 'Council of the Europeon Union' is helped by most countrys in the world and it is very important.

European Commission

The European Commission (officially called the Commission of the European Communities) is one of the five organisations that manage the European Union (EU). The Commission manages the day to day running of the EU and writes laws, like a government. Laws written by the Commission are discussed and changed by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The Commission sits in Brussels.

The Commission is made of 27 people, one from each of the countries in the EU. One of these people is the President, who was chosen by the Council and Parliament, he decides (with each country) who the other members are and what they do. Each one has a different job, such as looking after industry or trade. If they do not do their job properly, the President can remove them. If he does not, or if the President does not do his job, the Parliament can remove the whole Commission from their jobs (this only happened in 1999).

The name Commission can also mean the 25,000 people who work for the President and his team. They follow the Commission's instructions in looking after the EU or writing a new law. It works in three languages, English, French and German.

The first Commission was created in 1952 and was called the "High Authority". But the modern Commission was created in 1957 and since then has had eleven Presidents;

Needle aspiration biopsy (NAB), also known as fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and fine needle aspiration (FNA), is a medical procedure performed to diagnose certain kinds of medical conditions, such as lumps in the neck. A thin needle is inserted into a mass or lump to extract cells that will be examined under a microscope. Fine needle aspiration biopsies are very safe, minor surgical procedures. Often, a major surgical (excisional or open) biopsy can be avoided by performing a needle aspiration biopsy instead.

<doc id="47615" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47615" title="Ultrasound">
Ultrasound

Ultrasound is a type of sound with a frequency bigger than humans can hear. This frequency, the 'upper-limit of human hearing,' is approximately 20,000 hertz (20 kilohertz).

Some animals, such as dogs, dolphins, bats, and mice, are able to hear sounds which have a frequency greater than upper-limit of the human ear. This makes them able to hear ultrasounds. Children can hear some high-pitched sounds that older adults cannot hear, as in humans the upper limit pitch of hearing gets lower as a person gets older. This frequency limit is caused by the middle ear that acts as a low-pass filter. If ultrasound is fed directly into the skull bone and reaches the cochlea without passing through the middle ear, much higher frequencies (up to about 200 kHz) can be heard. This effect (sometimes called ultrasonic hearing) was first discovered by divers exposed to a high-frequency (ca. 50 kHz) sonar signal.

Obstetric sonography is commonly used during pregnancy. Ultrasound is generally thought of as a "safe test" because it does not use ionising (destructive) radiation like x-rays, nuclear medicine, or CT scans.

Ultrasonic cleaners are sometimes mistakenly called supersonic cleaners. They are used at frequencies from 20-40 kHz for jewellery, lenses and other optical parts, watches, dental instruments, surgical instruments and industrial parts. An ultrasonic cleaner works by the energy released from the collapse of millions of tiny (microscopic) 'caviations's near the dirty surface. The bubbles formed by cavitation collapse forming small jets directed at the surface.

Data migration is a term computer scientists and economists use when they speak about moving data from one location to another. It can also mean that files, or folders with documents, or databases are moved from one server to another. This might be that because several databases are merged into one, or because the databases are reorganised. 

It is usually an automated process, supported by data migration tools. If the data structure is complex, the migration may be separated in several phases that are carried out consecutively.

Amusement arcade

An amusement arcade or video arcade is a place where people play arcade games such as video games, pinball machines, and slot machines. 
The earliest amusement arcades were called "penny arcades", and were opened in the nineteenth century. Penny arcades had game machines called "bagatelles", which were like billiards and pinball. Penny arcades were once popular at amusement parks and fairs, but by the 1950s, such coin-operated amusements were generally replaced by more modern games of chance and skill such as shooting galleries.

Videos were introduced in amusement arcades in the late 1970s and were most popular during the early 1980s. Arcades became popular with young people. Many video arcades began closing in the late 1990s, as the technology of home video game consoles began to rival and eventually exceed that of arcade games. However, video arcades remained popular in Japan, where they are called game centers.

Ice age

An ice age is a period when for a long time the temperature of Earth's climate is very low. This leads to an expansion of the continental ice sheets, polar ice sheets and mountain glaciers. 

"Ice age" is a phrase coined for the period of extensive ice sheets in the recent Pleistocene period. We now know that ice ages have happened a number of times in the past, the greatest and longest of which took place in the Proterozoic era, before multi-cellular eukaryotes evolved. 

Within an ice age, there are stages. The longer cold stages are called glacials or glacial periods. The shorter warm periods are called interglacials.

We are still, in a sense, in an ice age, because the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets still exist. When speaking of the last two million years, the Pleistocene ice age, in the glacials there were extensive ice sheets over the North American and Eurasian continents. The last glacial ended about 11,000 years ago when the present interglacial started.

Many glacial periods have occurred during the last few million years, initially at 40,000-year frequency but more recently at 100,000-year frequencies. These are the best studied. There have been four major ice ages in the further past.

Saxons

The Saxons or Saxon people are (today) a part of the German people, with their main areas of settlements in the German States of Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony, Westphalia, and the northeastern part of the Netherlands (Drenthe, Groningen, Twente, and Achterhoek). 

First told about by the Ancient Greek geographer Jean Julien, the pre-Christian area of the Saxon people first covered an area a little more to the northwest, with parts of the southern Jutland , Old Saxony and small parts of the eastern Netherlands. During the 5th century AD, the Saxons were part of the people invading the Romano-British province of Britannia, and so formed the Anglo-Saxons.

Before Christianization, the Saxons had much native pre-Christian Germanic paganism. After Christianization, parts of this religion remained up to today in people who came from the Saxons.

The word 'Saxon' is thought to come from the word seax, meaning a mixture of single-edged knives. The Saxons were thought by Charlemagne, and some people who study history, to be very war-like and angry.

The Finnish and Estonian name for Germany, "Saksa", comes from the Saxons.

Białystok

Białystok is the largest city in northeastern Poland and is the capital of the Podlaskie Voivodeship. It is situated in the Podlaskie Plain on the banks of the Biała River in the Podlaskie region, known collectively as the "Green Lungs of Poland".

The city charter dates back to 1692, but settlement activity in the area dates back to the 14th century. Białystok has traditionally been one of the leading center of academic, cultural and artistic life in Podlaskie and is the most important economic center in northeastern Poland. The location of the city in the neighborhood of Belarus, Lithuania and Russia, with convenient transportation connections, creates excellent conditions for economic and cultural development of the city. The geographical and historical conditions helped to foster Białystok as a place where people of different cultures, religions and nationalities lived together for centuries. It has shaped the specific character of the city – openness, friendliness and hospitality.

Among cities of Poland, Białystok is second in terms of population density, eleventh in population, and thirteenth in area. The city and its adjacent municipalities constitute Metropolitan Białystok.

The city of Białystok has existed for five centuries. During all this time the fate of the city has passed between various political and economic forces. The various historically driven changes have had a very significant influence on the architectural space of the city. This activity relates to the fate of most other Polish cities, but the processes in Białystok had a particularly intense course. Numerous historic works of architecture no longer exist while many others have been rebuilt to their original configuration. The historic buildings of the city have not been preserved very well – the sights are merely an echo of the old historical shape of Białystok.

Over the course of the last 200 years, the city has been the capital of numerous administrative divisions of a number of countries or occupying powers;

Since 1999 it has been the capital of the Podlaskie Voivodeship, Republic of Poland.

Białystok is situated in the Białystok Uplands () of the Podlaskie Plain (), part of what is known collectively as the "Green Lungs of Poland". The Biała River, a left tributary of the Supraśl River, passes through the city.

The landscape of the Białystok Upland is diverse, with high moraine hills in excess of above sea level. Vast areas of outwash are occupied by forests, which created a number of nature reserves including Knyszyn Forest, of which a portion exists within the city limits.

The city has a Warm Summer Continental climate (Dfb) according to the Köppen climate classification system, which is characterized by warm temperatures during summer and long and frosty winters. It is substantially different from most of the other Polish lowlands. The region is one of the coldest in Poland, with the average temperature in January being -. The average temperature in a year is . The number of frost days ranges from 50 to 60, with frost from 110 to 138 days and the duration of snow cover from 90 to 110 days. Mean annual rainfall values oscillate around , and the vegetation period lasts 200 to 210 days.

The city of Białystok is divided into 28 administrative units (Osiedla). The first 27 of these were created on October 25, 2004. The 28th, Dojlidy Górne, was created on October 23, 2006, out of three settlements which had been incorporated into the city: Dojlidy Górne, Kolonia Halickie, and Zagórki.

Metropolitan Białystok was designated by the Voivodeship of the Regulation No. 52/05 of 16 May 2005 in order to help economically develop the region. In 2006, the metropolitan area population was 450,254 inhabitants. It covers an area of . For one km, there are about 265 people. Among urban residents are more women – 100 men for every 108 women on average. The municipalities adjacent to Białystok are slowly losing their agricultural character, becoming residential suburban neighborhoods.

In June 2009, the population of the city was 294,399. Among cities of Poland, Białystok is second in terms of population density, eleventh in population, and thirteenth in area.

Historically, Białystok has been a destination for internal and foreign immigration, especially from Central and Eastern Europe. In addition to the Polish minority, there was a significant Jewish majority in Białystok. According to the Russian Empire Census of 1897, out of the total population of 66,000, Jews constituted 41,900 (around 63% percent). Białystok's pre-World War II Jewish population constituted about 63 percent of the city's total population of 107,000. World War II changed all of this. In 1939 ca. 107,000 persons lived in Białystok, but in 1946 – only 56,759, and to this day there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of the city's history. Currently the city's population is 97% Polish, 2.5% Belarusian and 0.5% of a number of minorities including Russians, Lipka Tartars, Ukrainians and Romani. Most of the modern-day population growth is based on internal migration and urbanization.

Białystok, like other major cities in Poland, is a city county ("powiat"). The Białystok City Council has 28 elected members, one of whom is the mayor, or President of Białystok, elected every four years. The election of the City Council and of the local head of government, which takes place at the same time, is based on legislation introduced on 20 June 2002. The current President of Białystok, elected for his first term in 2006, is Tadeusz Truskolaski.

It is also the seat of government for the Podlaskie Voivodeship. The city is represented by several members of both houses of the Polish Parliament (Sejm and Senat). Białystok is represented by the Podlaskie and Warmian-Masurian constituency of the European Parliament.

The 18th Reconnaissance Regiment of the Polish Land Forces is based in Białystok. The heritage of the unit was the former 18th Territorial Defense Battalion and prior to that the former 18th Mechanized Brigade.

The Podlaska Cavalry Brigade was a military unit of the Polish Army, created on April 1, 1937. Its headquarters was located in Białystok. It was formed from the Cavalry Brigade "Białystok", which existed between February 1929, and March 30, 1937. After the Soviet invasion of Poland, remnants of the Brigade fought both Wehrmacht and Red Army troops, surrendering on October 6, 1939.

In the 19th century Białystok was an important center for light industry. This was the reason for the substantial growth of the city's population. The tradition continued with many garment factories established in the 20th century, such as "Fasty" in the district of Bacieczki. However, after the fall of communism in 1989 many of these factories faced severe problems and subsequently closed down. Currently Białystok is a major center for the developed machine industry (electronics, machinery and metal), wood, alcoholic beverages, building materials, glass factory and power generation.

The city lies close to the Polish border with Lithuania and Belarus, with the nearest border checkpoint with Belarus in Bobrowniki only away. Since the border with Belarus is also the eastern border of the European Union, as well as the Schengen Area, the city is a center for trade from countries to the east.

In 2010, Białystok was on the short-list, but ultimately lost the competition to become a finalist for European Capital of Culture in 2016.

Białystok is the largest cultural center in north-eastern Poland. Museums include the Historical Museum, the Museum of Sculpture Alfons Karny, and the Białystok Village Museum.

Approximately 32% of the city is occupied by green areas. Parks and squares and 1,779 ha of forest are located within the city which creates a unique and healthy climate. Within Bialystok, there are two nature reserves with a total area of 105 ha, that are part of the Knyszyn Forest. Such a location of nature reserves in the immediate vicinity of the city is unique.

The city has a number of sports teams, both professional and amateur, and a number of venues across the city. Jagiellonia Białystok is a Polish football club, based in Białystok, that plays in Ekstraklasa league at the Białystok City Stadium. In 2010, Jagiellonia Białystok won the Polish Cup and the Super Cup, and qualified to play in the third round qualification of the UEFA Europa League. A new 22,500 seat stadium is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.

Białystok has a wide variety of media outlets serving the city and surrounding region. There are two locally published newspapers in addition to two national papers with local bureaus. There are a number of national and locally produced television and radio channels available both over-the-air from the nearby RTCN Białystok (Krynice) Mast, the seventh highest structure in Poland, in addition to transmitter sites within the city and on the cable television network within the city.

In the early 1900s, Białystok was reputed to have the largest concentration of Jews of all the cities in the world. In 1931, 40,000 Jews lived in the city, nearly half the city's inhabitants.
The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Białystok. Establishment of the Diocese and the Archdiocese and the cities of Bialystok ended the period of the temporary church administration in the Bialystok region owned lands over the centuries to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vilnius, which after World War II remained in the Polish borders. The city is also the seat of the Bialystok-Gdansk Diocese of the Polish Orthodox Church. Bialystok is the largest concentration of Orthodox believers in Poland.

The city is, and has been for centuries, the main hub of transportation for the Podlaskie Voivodeship and the entire northeastern section of Poland. It is a major city on the European Union roadways and railways to the Baltic Republics and Finland. It is also a main gateway of trade with Belarus due to its proximity to the border and its current and longstanding relationship with Hrodno, Belarus. Passenger trains connect from Suvalki (Poland), Hrodno and Lithuania to Warsaw and the rest of the European passenger network. An extensive public transportation system is provided within the city by three bus services, but no tram or subway exists.

A civil airport, Białystok-Krywlany Airport, lies within the city limits, but does not provide regularly scheduled service. There are plans to build a new regional airport, "Białystok-Saniki Airport", in the next few years that will provide flights within Europe.

Higher education in the city can be traced back to the second half of the 18th century when the ownership of the city was inherited by Jan Klemens Branicki. As a patron of the arts and sciences, Branicki encouraged numerous artists and scientists to settle in Białystok to take advantage of Branicki's patronage. In 1745 Branicki established Poland's first military college, the School of Civil and Military Engineering, in the city.

Since the fall of communism many private-funded institutions of higher educations were founded and their number is still increasing. Currently Białystok is home to one principal public university (University of Białystok) and two other public specialist universities (Białystok Technical University and Medical University of Białystok). Some institutions, such as Musical Academy in Białystok, are branches of their parent institutions in other cities, usually in Warsaw.

Over the centuries Białystok has produced a number of persons who have provided unique contributions to the fields of science, language, politics, religion, sports, visual arts and performing arts. This environment was created in the mid-18th century by the patronage of Jan Klemens Branicki for the arts and sciences. A list of recent notable persons includes, but is not limited to:

Heterotroph

A heterotroph (Greek "heteros" = another and "trophe" = nutrition) is an organism that requires organic substrates to get its carbon for growth and development.

A heterotroph is known as a consumer in the food chain. Consumers are organisms that cannot make their own food supply. They use the food that producers make, or they eat other organisms. Animals are consumers. To stay alive, consumers must get food from other organisms. There are three types of consumers:Herbivores, Carnivores, and Omnivores.

Consumers that only eat plants are called herbivores. The word herbivore comes from the Latin words "herba", which means "grass or herb," and "vorare", which means "to eat." A giraffe is an example of a herbivorous consumer.

Consumers that only eat animals are called carnivores. The word comes from the Latin "carnis", which means "flesh", and "vorare", which means "to eat." A tiger is an example of a carnivorous consumer.

Consumers that eat both plants and animals are called omnivores. The word comes from the Latin "omnis", which means "all" and "vorare". Humans are a good example of an omnivorous consumer.

Alice Cooper

Alice Cooper (born February 4, 1948) is an American rock musician and singer. Originally, there was a band called Alice Cooper led by a singer named Vincent Damon Furnier. The band was one of the creators of a very theatrical and violent type of heavy metal music that was designed to shock and would come to be known as "shock rock."

In 1974, Furnier legally changed his name to Alice Cooper and started making solo music. Cooper's solo career began with the 1975 album "Welcome to My Nightmare". Over the years Cooper has played many different musical styles.

Alice Cooper is known for his social and witty persona offstage. "The Rolling Stone Album Guide" referred to him as the world's most ""beloved"" heavy metal entertainer. He helped to shape the sound and look of heavy metal. Cooper is also credited as being one of the first to bring movie-like looks to the rock concert stage in the late 1960s.

Away from music, Cooper is also an actor, a golfer, a restaurant owner and a popular radio DJ.

Guayana Esequiba

Guayana Esequiba is the name that Venezuela calls a region that it claims in the west of Guyana. Its area is 159,500 square kilometers. Guyana calls this area the six administrative regions of Barima-Waini, Cuyuni-Mazaruni, Pomeroon-Supenaam, Potaro-Siparuni, Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo and Essequibo Islands-West Demerara. 

Spain made its first claim on this area in a report dated 10 July 1788:

"It has been stated that the south coast of the Orinoco from the point of Barima, 20 leagues more or less inland, up to the creek of Curucima, is low lying and swampy land and, so, reckoning all this tract as useless, very few patches of fertile land being found therein, and hardly any savannahs and pastures, it is disregarded; so taking as chief base the said creek of Curucima, or the point of the chain and ridge in the great arm of the Imataka, an imaginary line will be drawn running to the south-south-east following the slopes of the ridge of the same name which is crossed by the Rivers Aguire, Arature and Amacuro, and others, in the distance of 20 leagues, direct to the Cuyuni; from there it will run on to the Masaruni and Essequibo, parallel to the sources of the Berbis and Surinama; this is the directing line of the course which the new Settlements and foundations proposed must follow."

In 1840, Venezuela claimed all of Guyana west of the Essequibo River — 62% of what was then British Guiana. Britain and Venezuela argued over the boundary between British Guiana and Venezuela for much of the 19th century. On 21 February 1881, in a note to Lord Grenville, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Great Britain at that time, Venezuela suggested a border line starting from a point one mile to the north of the Moruka River, drawn from there westward to the 60th meridian, and running south along that meridian. This would have given the Barima District to Venezuela. The Government of Venezuela, in the case it made to the Arbitration Tribunal, changed its claim on the district just west of the Essequibo, and claimed that the boundary should run from the mouth of the Moruka River southwards to the Cuyuni River, near where it meets the Mazaruni River, and then along the east bank of the Essequibo to the Brazilian border. Britain and Venezuela accepted the decision of the Tribunal in 1899.

Venezuela raised the issue again in 1962, four years before Guyana won independence from Britain. At a meeting in Geneva in 1966, the two countries agreed to hear ideas from a representative of the UN Secretary General on ways to settle the dispute peacefully. There are still diplomatic contacts between the two countries and the Secretary General's representative.

On recognizing the independence of Guyana on 26 May 1966, Venezuela said:

"Venezuela recognises as territory of the new State the one which is located on the east of the right bank of the Essequibo River, and reiterates before the new State, and before the international community, that it expressly reserves its rights of territorial sovereignty over all the zone located on the west bank of the above-mentioned river. Therefore, the Guyana-Essequibo territory over which Venezuela expressly reserves its sovereign rights, limits on the east by the new State of Guyana, through the middle line of the Essequibo River, beginning from its source and on to its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean."

Venezuelan maps drawn since 1970 show all the area from the eastern bank of the Essequibo, including the islands in the river, as Venezuelan territory. On some maps, the western Essequibo region is called the "Zone of Reclamation" .

Sudeley Castle was mainly built in 1441 by Ralph Boteler, who had the castle confiscated by Edward IV of England. Edward gave Sudeley Castle to his brother, who later became Richard III of England, who then gave it to his uncle Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford.

By the time Henry VIII of England succeeded, the castle was the property of the Crown again. It had been visited by Henry in 1535, with his second wife Anne Boleyn, but had been empty and unattended for some time. When Henry died the castle became the property of his son, Edward VI of England, who gave it to his uncle, Thomas Seymour. Thomas was made Lord of Sudeley and married the King's stepmother, Catherine Parr. During this time Thomas began to regenerate the castle for Catherine's use, but only one room that he had built remains today.

Seymour and Catherine moved into the castle and brought with them ladies to attend on the Queen Dowager, as well as gentlemen of the household and Yeomen of the guard. The castle was then home to over 100 people. Another famous figure who came to live in the castle of Lady Jane Grey, who was a ward of Seymour's, as well as the young Elizabeth I of England.

Catherine died after she had given birth to a daughter, Mary, at Sudeley Castle and was buried in its St. Mary's Chapel. Her grave was discovered in 1728 after the castle and the chapel had been left in ruins by the English Civil War. She was later reinterred by the Rector of Sudeley in 1817. 

Seymour's ambitions led to him being arrested and beheaded, after which Sudeley Castle became the property of Catherine's brother William Parr, who was the Marquess of Nothampton. Parr was stripped of his property and title after being involved in the failed attempt to make Lady Jane Grey Queen of England.

In 1554 Mary I of England gave Sudeley Castle John Brydges, Lord Chandos and it remained as his property throughout the reign of Elizabeth I of England. Elizabeth was entertained three times at Sudeley Castle, which including a spectacular feast in 1592 to celebrate the anniversary of the defeat of the Spanish Armada.

Without You

"Without You" is a song written by musicians Peter Ham and Tom Evans, which has become a standard since it was first recorded in 1970.

Ham and Evans were members of the rock band Badfinger, and they combined the verse of one unfinished song with the chorus of another, to complete "Without You". Badfinger included their version of the song on their second album, "No Dice", which was released in 1970. Apple Records was Badfinger's record label, and the song was published by a related company, Apple Music.

The song got little attention at first, but when Harry Nilsson recorded a of it, his single became a worldwide hit. Nilsson, Ham and Evans all reached career peaks, and Nilsson won a Grammy Award for his recording.

"Without You" became, and remains, very popular around the world. Many other artists have recorded the song, and several have had hits with it, including Mariah Carey. Apple Music lost the American rights to the song, early in the 21st century.

Apple Records

Apple Records was a record label started by The Beatles, which was active from 1968 until 1975. It was a division of the Beatles's company Apple Corps. EMI served as distributors for Apple.

Recording artists who appeared on the Apple label included James Taylor, Mary Hopkin, Badfinger, Billy Preston, Yoko Ono, and members of the Beatles before and after their breakup in 1970.

While the Beatles and their business associates had high hopes for Apple at first, the tensions that caused the Beatles to split also hurt the label. Many of the records released on Apple failed to become popular, either because they did not go over well with listeners, or were not given the promotion they needed or deserved to become hit records. James Taylor "walked out" on his Apple Records contract, and signed with Warner Bros., where he began a long string of hits. Mary Hopkin retired from music after completing her contract. Billy Preston and Badfinger moved on to other record labels.

Apple Records released the last of its non-Beatles records in 1973, and when their distribution deal with EMI ended in 1975, the label went out of business. It was reactivated in the late 1980s, when the Beatles's music first appeared on compact disc. In 1992, most of Apple's other music also began to appear on CD.

Yoko Ono's Apple recordings were not reissued by the label, because her husband John Lennon (a member of the Beatles) had to buy them back from Apple as part of a business settlement. After his death in 1980, Ono became the owner of the recordings. She later reissued them through another label, called Rykodisc.

Apple Records no longer signs new artists or groups, but new Beatles issues continue to appear on the Apple label.

Germanic peoples

The Germanic peoples are a linguistic and ethnic branch of Indo-European peoples. They came from Northern Europe and are identified by their use of the Germanic languages. Migrating Germanic peoples spread throughout Europe, mixing with existing local populations (such as Celts, but also Slavs/Vends and Romans), forming the future basis of many nations, that are connected by similar languages and common history, and culture.

Latin "Germani" is first used by Julius Caesar.

But the Germanic tribes did not have a self name that included all Germanic-speaking people. In English, "German" is first attested in 1520, replacing earlier use of "Almain" or "Dutch". Dutch is now used in the English language to refer to the language and the inhabitants of the Netherlands.

By the 1st century A.D., the writings of Caesar, Tacitus and other Roman era writers indicate a division of Germanic-speaking peoples into tribal groupings centred on:

The Sons of Mannus Istvaeones, Irminones, and Ingvaeones are collectively called West Germanic tribes. In addition, those Germanic people who remained in Scandinavia are referred to as North Germanic. These groups all developed separate dialects, the basis for the differences among Germanic languages down to the present day.

The division of peoples into West Germanic, East Germanic, and North Germanic is a modern linguistic classification.

The Germanic tribes were each politically independent, under a hereditary king (see Germanic king). The kings appear to have claimed descendancy from mythical founders of the tribes, the name of some of which is preserved:

The early Germanic tribes spoke mutually intelligible dialects, and shared a common culture and mythology (see Germanic mythology), as is indicated by "Beowulf" and the Volsunga saga.

In the absence of large-scale political unification, such as that imposed forcibly by the Romans upon the peoples of Italy, the various tribes remained free, led by their own hereditary or chosen leaders.

May (Fung-Yee) Pang (born October 24, 1950) was a to former Beatle John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono. She later became Lennon's companion and lover, when he separated from Ono in the mid-1970s. Pang was born in New York, New York and is of Chinese ancestry.

Pang was a secretary at ABKCO, a management company started by Allen Klein, in New York City. ABKCO's clients included three of the Beatles: Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. When Lennon and wife Ono needed an assistant, Pang was sent to England to work for them. She dated musician Peter Ham of Badfinger, and helped Lennon and Ono move to the United States, late in 1971.

During 1973, Lennon and Ono began to have problems in their marriage. Ono trusted Pang, and suggested her as a companion for Lennon, knowing he wanted to see other women. Lennon surprised Ono by taking Pang with him to Los Angeles, where he planned to record an album with Phil Spector. Lennon and Pang lived together for over a year, while he worked on new music, and tried to decide whether to divorce Ono or with her.

Lennon and Ono decided to reconcile early in 1975, and became the parents of Sean Lennon. Even though Pang had been involved with the marketing of several of Lennon's records, and also records by Harry Nilsson and Ringo Starr, she had a hard time finding a new job. She later found out the reason was because many companies were afraid Lennon would not want to do business with them, if he knew she worked there.

Pang finally found a job with Island Records, and later worked for RKO. She married record producer Tony Visconti (the former husband of singer Mary Hopkin), and they started a family. After Lennon's death in 1980, Pang wrote a , titled "Loving John". She also appeared on many talk shows, to discuss her relationship with Lennon.

When The Beatles started their own record label called Apple Records, they were looking for new artists to sign up. Model Twiggy, a friend of the band, had seen Hopkin on a , and recommended her. After Hopkin signed with Apple, Beatle Paul McCartney produced many of the songs for her first album, called "Post Card". Singer-songwriters Donovan and Harry Nilsson, and record producer George Martin, also gave her songs to record.

"Those Were The Days" was McCartney's choice for Hopkin's first single. He chose well, and the song became a hit worldwide. Hopkin recorded other singles, including "Goodbye", "Temma Harbour", "Knock, Knock, Who's There", and a remake of Doris Day's "Qué Sera, Sera", but they were not as successful as her first record. McCartney moved on to a solo career after the Beatles disbanded, and no longer worked with her. Hopkin's second album, "Earth Song/Ocean Song", was largely self-produced.

Hopkin disliked the way Apple Records had promoted her, as a kind of "" , and left the label after two albums and a best-ofs compilation, also titled "Those Were the Days". She retired from music after marrying producer Tony Visconti, but she did appear as a background singer on a few of his productions.

Solon was a statesman in Ancient Greece. He is one of Seven Sages (or Wise Men) of Greece, because of his political reforms to the laws of Athens. Many of these changes helped the poor people. He lived from 630 B.C.- 560 B.C. He introduced the court and judges. About 594 B.C., the nobles elected Solon to lead Athens. He made reforms that helped prevent a revolt by the poor. First he freed people who had become slaves because of debts. He made a law that no citizen could be enslaved. Solon also organized citizens into four classes based on wealth, not birth. Rich men had more power; yet this was still a fairer system than the old one that limited power to nobles. Solon allowed all citizens to serve in the assembly and help elect leaders. He also reformed the laws to make them less harsh.

Omelette

An omelette or "omelet" is a type of food that is mainly eggs, with various fillings. In the United States "omelets" are usually eaten at breakfast. However omelettes can be eaten as a light lunch or late evening meal.

An omelette is prepared from beaten eggs cooked with butter or oil in a frying pan. A thin, flat 'heavy' omelette is usually folded around a filling such as cheese, vegetables, meat, or some combination of these ingredients. In some traditions, omelettes are fried to cook the bottom and then flipped over or in half for final stage of cooking. However, in other traditions, omelettes is baked to cook it evenly or the top is cooked under a broiler. When making an omelette, it is best to use several eggs. Put a little water in with the eggs when you mix them up because the water helps the eggs to produce steam as they cook. The steam makes them lighter and fluffier. Using oil in the bottom of a nonstick omelette pan helps prevent the omelette from sticking. Follow these tips, add your favourite filling, and you will make a tasty omelette quickly and easily.

For a full light and fluffy omolette separate the egg whites and whisk to stiff peaks then fold in the yolks. Cook by frying in a knob of butter on a medium heat until centre starts to dry then fold in half and cook until its hot in the middle.

There are many different types of omelette, often with different names, depending on what is used as a filling.
Arnold Bennett (27 May 1867 - 27 March 1931) was a British writer. Often after having been to the theatre in London he visited the Savoy Hotel's Grillroom. The chef added haddock, cream and Parmesan cheese to the basic omelette and called the new dish "Omelette Arnold Bennett" in his customer's honour.

When Napoleon Bonaparte and his army were marching through southern France, they stopped for the night near the town of Bessieres. A local innkeeper made Napoleon an omelette. Napoleon was so impressed by the cooking he ordered the townspeople to collect all the eggs in the village and to prepare a huge omelette for his army the next day.

<doc id="47751" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47751" title="Visa">
Visa

A visa (short for the Latin "carta visa", lit. "the document having been seen") is a permit given by a country that allows someone to go to that country. A visa is a document that is stamped on a person's passport by an embassy. It names the kind of visit and says how long the person can stay. Sometimes, people need to go through an interview held at the embassy before they get a visa.

Many countries require foreign visitors to have a valid passport and a visa before they can enter the country, but there are exceptions (see below for examples of such these).

Visas are associated with the request for permission to enter (or exit) a country, and are thus, for some countries, not the same as actual formal permission for an alien to enter and remain in the country.

Some countries, such as some states of the former Soviet Union, require that their citizens, and sometimes foreign travelers, obtain an exit visa in order to be allowed to leave the country. Until 2004, foreign students in Russia were issued only an entry visa on being accepted to University there, and had to obtain an exit visa to return home. This policy has since been changed, and foreign students are now issued multiple entry (and exit) visas.

Some visas can be granted on arrival or by prior application at the country's embassy or consulate, or sometimes through a specialized travel agency with permission from the issuing country in the country of departure. If there is no embassy or consulate in one's home country, then one would have to travel to a third country (or apply by post) and try to get a visa issued there. The need or absence of need of a visa generally depends on the citizenship of the applicant, the intended duration of the stay, and the activities that the applicant may wish to undertake in the country he visits; these may delineate different formal categories of visas, with different issue conditions.

Some, but not all, countries have reciprocal visa regimes: if Country A requires citizens of Country B to have a visa to travel there, then Country B may apply reciprocity and require a visa from citizens of Country A. Likewise, if A allows B's citizens to enter without a visa, B may allow A's citizens to enter without a visa.

Examples of such reciprocal visa regimes are between:

A fee may be charged for issuing a visa; these are typically also reciprocal, so if country A charges country B's citizens 50 USD for a visa, country B will often also charge the same amount for country A's visitors. The fee charged may also be at the discretion of each embassy. A similar reciprocity often applies to the duration of the visa (the period in which one is permitted to request entry of the country) and the amount of entries one can attempt with the visa. Expedited processing of the visa application for some countries will generally incur additional charges.

This reciprocal fee has become more common in recent years with the decision of the United States to charge nationals of various countries a $100 visa processing fee (non-refundable, even if a visa is not issued). A number of countries, including Brazil, Chile, and Turkey have reciprocated. Brazil requires an advance visa before entry into the country, and that a US citizen be fingerprinted and photographed on arrival—matching U.S. requirements for Brazilians and other foreigners.

The issuing authority, usually a branch of the country's foreign ministry or department (e.g. U.S. State Department), and typically consular affairs officers, may request appropriate documentation from the applicant. This may include proof that the applicant is able to support himself in the host country (lodging, food), proof that the person hosting the applicant in his or her home really exists and has sufficient room for hosting the applicant, proof that the applicant has obtained health and evacuation insurance, etc. Some countries ask for proof of health status, especially for long-term visas; some countries deny such visas to persons with certain illnesses, such as AIDS. The exact conditions depend on the country and category of visa. Notable examples of countries requiring HIV tests of long-term residents are Russia and Uzbekistan. However, in Uzbekistan, the HIV test requirement is sometimes not strictly enforced. 

Developed countries frequently demand strong evidence of intent to return to the home country, if the visa is for a temporary stay, and especially if the applicant is from a developing country, due to immigration concerns.

The issuing authority may also require applicants to attest that they have had no criminal convictions, or that they do not partake in certain activities (like prostitution or drug trafficking). Some countries will deny visas if the travellers' passports show evidence of citizenship or travel to a country which is not recognized by that country. For example, Saudi Arabia will not issue visas to nationals of Israel or those with evidence of visiting Israel.

Common types of visas are:

Less common visas include:


Visas can also be "single-entry", which means the visa is cancelled as soon as the holder leaves the country, "double-entry", or "multiple-entry", permitting multiple entries into the country with the same visa. Countries may also issue re-entry permits that allow temporarily leaving the country without invalidating the visa. Even a business visa will normally not allow the holder to work in the host country without an additional work permit.

Once issued, a visa will usually have to be used within a certain period of time.

The validity of a visa is not the same as the authorized period of stay in the issuing country. The visa validity usually indicates when the alien can apply for entry to the country. For example, if a visa has been issued January 1st and expires March 30th, and the typical authorized period of stay in a country is 90 days, then the 90-day authorized stay starts on the day the passenger reaches the country, which has to be between January 1st and March 30th. The traveller could therefore stay in the issuing country until July 1st. 

Once in the country, the validity period of a visa or authorized stay can often be extended for a fee if the immigration authorities choose to do so. Staying longer than the period of authorized stay given by the immigration officers is considered illegal immigration even if the visa validity period is not over (i.e. for multiple entry visas) and a form of being "out of status" and the offender may be fined, prosecuted, deported, or even blacklisted (banned) from entering the country again. 

Entering a country without a valid visa or visa exemption may result in being arrested and removed (deportation or exclusion) from the country. Doing things that are not authorized by the status of entry (for example, working while having a non-worker tourist status) can result in the individual being deemed removable, in common speech an illegal alien. Such violation is not a violation of a visa, despite the common misuse of the phrase, but a violation of status, hence the term "out of status."

Even having a visa does not guarantee that somebody can enter ah ost country. The border crossing authorities make the final determination to allow entry, and may even cancel a visa at the border if the alien cannot demonstrate to their satisfaction that they will abide by the status their visa grants them.

Visa and immigration laws may be very different among countries. As such, aliens are advised to check with immigration lawyers for visa and immigration laws governing the countries they wish to enter and eligibility to receive visas or other immigration benefits.

Many countries have a mechanism to allow the holder of a visa to apply to stay longer in that country. For example, in Denmark a visa holder can apply to the Danish Immigration Service for a Residence Permit after they have arrived in the Country. In the United Kingdom applications can be made to the Border and Immigration Agency. In certain circumstances, it is not possible for the holder of the visa to do this, either because the country does not have a mechanism to prolong visas or, most likely, because the holder of the visa is using a short stay visa to live in a country. In such cases, the holder often engages in what is known as a visa run; leaving the country for a short period in order to apply for a new visa prior to their return or so that they can be given a fresh permission to stay when they re-enter.

A visa may be denied for a number of reasons, including (but not limited to) if the applicant:

Possession of a valid visa is a condition for entry into many countries, however various exemption schemes do exist. In some cases visa-free entry may be granted to holders of diplomatic passports even as visas are required by normal passport holders ("see: Passport").

Some countries have reciprocal agreements such that a visa is not needed under certain conditions, e.g. when the visit is for tourism and for a relatively short period. One example of this is the Visa Waiver Program of the United States. Such reciprocal agreements may stem from common membership in international organizations or a shared heritage:
Other countries may unilaterally grant visa-free entry to nationals of certain countries in order to facilitate tourism.

Visa-free travel between countries also occurs in all cases where passports are not needed for such travel. 

Normally, visas are valid for entry only into the country which issued the visa. Countries that are members of regional organizations or party to regional agreements may however issue visas valid for entry into some or all of the member states of the organization or agreement:

The Angles, together with the Jutes, Saxons and Frisians, were mentioned amongst the Germanic tribes who sailed across the North Sea to raid and eventually invade Great Britain.

Angeln

Modern Angeln, (Danish: Angel; Latin: Anglia, which also means in direct translation from Latin: England), is a peninsula in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. 
Ancient Angeln may have been somewhat larger than the Angeln of today, but following the ancient sources it included the territory of modern Angeln.

Angeln has an importance far beyond its small area, as it seems to have been the original home of the Angles who invaded the southern part of Great Britain, which was named after them, England. And so the name of the major world language, English, seems to have taken its name from this little region.

Following the departure of the Angles from Anglia about 350 , the region was occupied by Danish settlers not later than the 8th century.

Frisian people

The Frisians are a group of people of northwestern Europe, living in an area known as Frisia. They are mainly in the Dutch provinces of Friesland and Groningen and, in Germany, East Frisia and North Frisia. They said to be a tall, big-boned and light-haired people and they have a rich history and folklore.

The Frisians were able to make a treaty with the Romans at the River Rhine in AD 28. Sixteen years late they defeated the Romans under Tiberius at the "Battle of Baduhennawood". The Frisii were known and respected by the Romans and written about by several writers. Tacitus wrote about the Germanic peoples in 69, describing the habits of the Germanic people, as well as listing numerous tribes by name. Of the many tribes he listed, the Frisians are the only ones that have kept their ancient name.

They were probably a people of seafarers. The North Sea from Britain to Eastern Denmark, was called "Mare Frisia" at that time. Small groups of Frisians settled the surrounding lands and their settlements have been found in England, Scotland, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, France and obviously The Netherlands.

Their territory followed the coast of the North Sea from the mouth of the Rhine river up to that of the Ems, their eastern border according to Ptolemy's "Geographica". 

In the 5th century, many of them joined the migration of the Anglo-Saxons who went through Frisian territory to invade Great Britain, while those who stayed in Europe moved into the newly-emptied lands previously lived in by the Anglo-Saxons.

Vampire bat

Vampire bats is a subfamily of bats. Unlike other bats, vampire bats feed on blood. Currently, there are three species of bats known to do this. All of them live in the Americas, in Mexico, Brazil, Chile and Argentina. Of the three known species, one feeds on the blood of mammals, the other two on the blood of birds.
The common vampire bat lives in large groups, of up to 100 animals. They have developed complex social behaviour. 

Vampire bats commonly spread diseases, most notably rabies. The saliva of the vampire bats contain chemicals that prevent the clotting of the blood of the victim; this has been used to develop drugs to help the patients of strokes and heart attacks.

The False Vampire Bats are not vampire bats; they do not feed on blood, some eat fruits, others devour small animals.

Vampires may be modeled on the bats.

Prehistoric Britain

Prehistoric Britain was a period in the human occupation of Great Britain that ended with the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43. (See: Roman Britain)

Britain has been inhabited for hundreds of thousands of years. None of the pre-Roman inhabitants of Britain had any written language, so their history, culture and way of life are known only through archaeological finds. 

The first written record of Britain and its inhabitants was by the Greek navigator Pytheas, who explored the coastal region of Britain around 325 BC. Ancient Britons were however involved in extensive trade and cultural links with the rest of Europe from the Neolithic onwards, especially in exporting tin.

Palaeolithic Britain is the period from almost 750,000 years ago until around 10,000 years ago. This huge length of time saw many changes in the environment, several glacial and interglacial periods which greatly affected human settlement in the region. 

There is evidence from bones and flint tools found in coastal deposits near Happisburgh in Norfolk and Pakefield in Suffolk that "Homo erectus" was present in what is now Britain around 700,000 years ago. At this time, southern and eastern Britain was linked to continental Europe by a wide land bridge allowing humans to move freely. The current position of the English Channel was a large river flowing westwards and fed by tributaries that would later become the Thames and Seine. 

The extreme cold of the following Anglian glaciation is likely to have driven humans out of Britain altogether. A warmer time period lasted from around 300,000 until 200,000 years ago. The more advanced flint technology permitted more efficient hunting. 

There is little evidence of human occupation during the subsequent Ipswichian interglacial between around 130,000 and 110,000 years ago. 

Neanderthal occupation of Britain was limited and by 30,000 BC the first signs of modern human (Homo sapiens) activity. The most famous example from this period is the burial of the Red Lady of Paviland in modern day Wales. A final ice age covered Britain between around 70,000 and 10,000 years ago with an extreme cold snap between 22,000 and 13,000 years ago which may have driven humans south out of Britain altogether. The environment during this ice age period would have been a largely treeless tundra, eventually replaced by a warmer climate, perhaps reaching 17 degrees Celsius (62.6 Fahrenheit) in summer which encouraged the expansion of birch trees as well as shrub and grasses.

The dominant food species were the Wild Horse ("Equus ferus") and Red Deer ("Cervus elaphus") although other mammals ranging from hares to mammoth were also hunted. 
By 10,500 years ago the climate was becoming cooler and dryer. Food animal populations seem to have declined although woodland coverage expanded. Tool manufacture in the Final Upper Palaeolithic revolved around smaller flints and bone and antler work became less common. However, the number of known sites is much larger and more widely spread. Many more open air sites are known such as that at Hengistbury Head.

Around 10,000 years ago the ice age finally ended. Temperatures rose, probably to levels similar to those today, and forests expanded farther. By 8,500 years ago, the rising sea levels caused by the melting glaciers cut Britain off from continental Europe for the last time. The warmer climate changed the Arctic environment to one of pine, birch, and alder forest.

Farming of both crops and domestic animals was adopted in Britain around 4,500 BC at least partly because of the need for reliable food sources.

Traditionally the arrival of the Neolithic in Britain has been seen as a wave of immigration from the continent. Modern archaeology now considers that farming along with pottery and settled living was in fact adopted by the native population who were related to the similarly newly-farming Neolithic people across the water. Links with continental Europe are demonstrated by finds of axes made from exotic stone such as jadeite. 

Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of modern European populations shows that over 80% are descended in the female line from European hunter-gatherers. Less than 20% are descended in the female line from Neolithic farmers from the Middle East. In 1997 DNA analysis was undertaken on a tooth from a Mesolithic man whose remains were found in Gough's Cave at Cheddar Gorge. His mitochondrial DNA was of a type found in 11% of modern European populations. 

Such findings have cast doubt on the traditional view of successive waves of mass immigration annihilating earlier peoples. 
In any case, the Neolithic Revolution, as it is called, introduced a more settled way of life and ultimately led to societies becoming divided into differing groups of farmers, artisans and leaders. 

The construction of the earliest earthwork sites in Britain began during the early Neolithic (c. 4400 BC- 3300 BC) in the form of long barrows used for communal burial. 

The Middle Neolithic (c. 3300 BC-c. 2900 BC) saw the development of cursus monuments close to earlier barrows. The earliest stone circles and individual burials also appear.

New enclosures, called henges were built, along with stone rows and the famous sites of Stonehenge and Silbury Hill reached their peak. Industrial flint mining such as that at Cissbury and Grimes Graves began.

In around 2,700 BC a new culture arrived in Britain, often referred to as the Beaker culture. Beaker pottery appears in the Mount Pleasant Phase (2,700 BC - 2,000 BC) along with flat axes and burial practices of inhumation. The megalithic phases of Stonehenge date to this period.

Britain had large reserves of tin in the areas of Cornwall and Devon in what is now southwest England, and thus tin mining began. By around 1,600 BC the southwest of Britain had a trade boom as British tin was exported across Europe.

The Beaker people were also skilled at making ornaments from gold, and examples of these have been found in graves of the wealthy Wessex culture of southern Britain.

In around 750 BC iron working techniques reached Britain from southern Europe. Iron was stronger and more plentiful than bronze, and its introduction marks the beginning of the Iron Age. Iron working revolutionised many aspects of life, most importantly agriculture. Iron tipped ploughs could churn up land far more quickly and deeply than older wooden or bronze ones, and iron axes could clear forest land far more efficiently for agriculture.

About 900 BC, British society changed again. The Celtic culture had by 500 BC covered most of the British Isles. The Celts were highly skilled craftsmen and produced nicely patterned gold jewellery and weapons in bronze and iron.

Iron Age Britons lived in organised tribal groups, ruled by a chieftain. 

As people became more numerous, fights broke out between opposing tribes. This led to the building of hill forts. The first had been built about 1,500 BC. Britain exported hunting dogs, animal skins and slaves.

The last centuries before the Roman invasion saw refugees from Gaul (modern day France and Belgium) known as the Belgae, who were displaced as the Roman Empire expanded.

From around 175 BC they settled in the areas of Kent, Hertfordshire and Essex and brought with them pottery making skills far more advanced than anything produced previously. The Belgae were partially Romanised and were responsible for creating the first settlements large enough to be called towns.

About 100 BC, iron bars began to be used as currency, coinage was developed, based on continental types.

As the Roman Empire expanded northwards, Rome began to take interest in Britain. See Roman Britain for the history of this period.

Domesday Book

The Domesday Book is the record of the great survey of much of England, and parts of Wales, completed in 1086, done for William I of England, or William the Conqueror. 

The Domesday Book (also known as "Domesday", or "Book of Winchester") was a record of all taxable land in England, together with such information as would indicate its worth. 

As the scribes went round England, they were protected by William's armed men. Each group was led by a Royal Commissioner, who took a list of standard questions. A 'jury' of local nobility and citizens answered the questions. All answers were written down in Latin.

Information was collected from the start of 1086, and working up into the complete volume started later that year. William died in 1087 before the writing-up work was completed.

William the Conqueror wished to know the details of the land he had conquered, England. He let his knights and barons have big areas of land, and wanted rent money from them. The Domesday Book was a record of every farm, village and house so that he knew how much rent he should get. Only some small villages in the country side are not in the book. Major cities like London and Winchester are also not in the Domesday Book, perhaps because of their size, or because (not owning land), the people could not be taxed. 

The Domesday book gave the names of King William's friends and even listed the number of pigs on a piece of land. But it was not like a modern census. It did not give the names of all the people. It listed the heads of each household, but left out Londoners, monks, nuns, and anyone living in castles. In effect, it listed only people he could get rent from, and who might supply men to fight in his army.

The Domesday Book is two volumes. One of the books was called "Great Domesday", and the other was called "Little Domesday". The draft of the second volume, Little Domesday, was never worked up, but no doubt was used for tax collection just the same.

The Domesday book got its name because its lists were so complete that it reminded people of the Last Judgment (which people also call Doomsday, or Domesday) in Christianity, when lists of what people have done go before God for people to be judged.

The name LD is an abbreviation for "Lethal Dose, 50%" or median lethal dose. It is the amount of the substance required (usually per body weight) to kill 50% of the test population. 

The test was created by J.W. Trevan in 1927 but has now been phased out . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has begun to approve non-animal alternatives to LD50, in response to research cruelty concerns and the lack of validity/sensitivity of animal tests as they relate to humans.

Dahlerau train disaster

The Dahlerau train disaster was a railway disaster that happened on 27 May 1971. It happened in Dahlerau, which is a part of Radevormwald in Germany.

A passenger train carrying pupils was travelling on the railway line from Wuppertal to Radevormwald on the evening of 27 May 1971.
The pupils belonged to the final year of a school in Radevormwald and were returning from a trip to Bremen. Around 21:00, the train had just left the railway station in "Wuppertal-Beyenburg" and was a few minutes away from the railway station in "Dahlerau". Farther south, a freight train was traveling from Radevormwald to Wuppertal, and had just arrived outside the Dahlerau station. The freight train would have to wait in the station to allow the passenger train to pass. This was necessary because the passenger train was 30 minutes late and there was only one track on the railway line outside the station.

The dispatcher in the station would have to go outside and show a red lantern to the freight train, because there were no signals in the station. Nobody knows for sure what happened, but the freight train went right through the station and onto the track where the passenger train was running. The driver of the freight train later told that the dispatcher in the station had shown him a green light. This was the signal not to stop.

The dispatcher had seen what happened and tried to hold the train back with emergency signals, but he failed and the train disappeared behind a curve. He went into his office to call the station in Wuppertal-Beyenburg, but the passenger train had already left Beyenburg. The dispatcher knew what would happen, and called the police. Meanwhile, about 800 metres north of the station, the two trains crashed. The passenger train was crushed to 1/3 of its length, because it consisted of light railbuses and the freight train locomotive was five times as heavy.
Police, firefighters and ambulances arrived quickly, but had problems rescuing people. This was because the crash happened on a hillside. The parents of the pupils had also heard of the accident and had come to search for their children. In all, 25 people were injured, many of them badly. 46 people died in the accident. Of these 46, 41 were pupils, two teachers, one was a mother who travelled with the children, and two were working for the railway. Only one person walked away from the accident without injuries. 
So many people had died that they had to be put in a gymnasium.

The dispatcher died a few weeks after the crash. He had a car accident, but police said it was not suicide. Because the dispatcher could not be asked, investigating the crash was difficult and took about a year. In the end, it was decided that human error was the cause for the accident. Nobody could find out the exact happenings on that evening, and so the case never went before a court. The passenger train was badly damaged and had to be destroyed. The locomotive of the freight train was repaired and stayed in service until 2001.

The victims were buried on 2 June 1971. More than 10,000 people attended the funeral, and all shops in Radevormwald were closed on that day. Many important people went to the funeral, like Chancellor Willy Brandt, and the Minister of Transport. The victims were buried together in a large grave on the Radevormwald cemetery. Later, a memorial was built near the graves as well.

The Deutsche Bundesbahn, the company who ran the trains, changed the lanterns used by the dispatchers. They would not show a red light any more, so that red and green could not be confused any more. They also built the successors of the type of railbus that crashed sturdier, because some people said they had been built too light.

The line from Wuppertal to Radevormwald was closed in 1976.

Modern Talking

Modern Talking was a German dance pop duo consisting of Thomas Anders and Dieter Bohlen. Their music was often classified as Europop. Modern Talking is, by sales, the most successful and popular group in Germany, and they a number of hit singles reaching the top-5 in many countries. Some of their most popular and widely known singles are "You're My Heart, You're My Soul", "You Can Win If You Want", "Cheri Cheri Lady", "Brother Louie", "Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. for Love)" and "Geronimo's Cadillac". 

Modern Talking's first period of activity was from 1984 to 1987. The duo reunified in 1998 and made a successful comeback, releasing more music from 1998 to 2003. Modern Talking's sound, however, was rather different from its original 1980s sound after its reunion. The duo came back in 1998 recording their materials based on what the demand was in central European music markets at the time in the late 1990s, which required their original 1980s mellow Europop sound to switch into 1990s up-tempo Eurodance. The duo released singles which again entered the top-10 not only in their home country but also abroad. Some of those singles were "You're My Heart, You're My Soul '98", "Brother Louie '98", and "You Are Not Alone".

The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, also called the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, was a great underwater earthquake. It happened at 00:58:53 UTC (07:58:53 local time) December 26, 2004. The epicenter of the earthquake was off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. At first, the earthquake was measured as a 9.0 on the Richter scale. Later, scientists said it was as high as a 9.3. Only the Great Chilean Earthquake has been more powerful. The earthquake also was the longest ever recorded. It lasted between 500(8.3 minutes) and 600(10 minutes) seconds. It was so powerful that it caused the entire Earth to vibrate. It started other earthquakes as far away as Alaska.

The large movement of earth under the water caused a very large and powerful tsunami. The tsunami was called the Asian Tsunami, or the Boxing Day Tsunami in Australia, Canada, England, and South Africa because it happened on the holiday of Boxing Day. The tsunami caused a lot of damage to countries such as Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. It also devasted the eastern coast of India,such as the states of Tamil Nadu,Orissa and Andhra Pradesh.

Waves as high as 30m (100ft) killed many people and damaged or destroyed a lot of buildings and other property. Over 225,000 people died or were not found after the Tsunami. The wave itself was 3 times the size of Moscow, Russia. The wave traveled as far away as South Africa (8000km/ 5000mi) where as many as 8 people died because of high water caused by the wave. Because of how much damage was caused and the number of people the earthquake affected, over $7 billion (USD) was donated to help the survivors and rebuild the areas damaged.

History of Taiwan

Taiwan (minus the Pescadores) is an island of eastern Asia. Its first people were related to Oceanic people with small numbers of Chinese. After the arrival of the Dutch in the 1600s, many Chinese moved to Taiwan to work. Few European people moved to Taiwan, and the native people married with Chinese or moved away from the west side of the island. When the Qing dynasty began in China, a supporter of the old Ming dynasty hid in Taiwan. Eventually the Qing came to Taiwan, defeated him, and added Taiwan to China. Taiwan remained Chinese territory through most of the Qing dynasty until it was taken by Japan in 1895. Taiwan became a colony of Japan for fifty years until the end of World War Two. For a brief time it was under the control of China through the Guomindang government, but that government lost a civil war and moved to Taiwan. The rule of the Guomindang is considered controversial in the modern day. Some criticize its treatment of the people of Taiwan, but others focus on positive political and economic change that it made. In the 1980s, the government Taiwan has became more democratic. This has also become controversial because it has allowed different political parties to compete. The Democratic Progressive Party gained influence in the government. During this time, Taiwan has officially been called the Republic of China but has acted independently of China. The People's Republic of China demands that Taiwan must become a part of China, while most Taiwanese debate the appropriate political status for today. These perspectives create a complicated situation in the politics of Taiwan.

The original people to move to Taiwan can be called the Aboriginal people. They have many similarities with others societies called Austronesian. Chinese historians have mentioned Taiwan several times since its Three Kingdoms period, although it was considered a land of barbarians.

About 50000 years ago was called the "Old Stone Age" in Taiwan. At that time, people hit rocks against each other to make tools. The most famous culture of Taiwanese old stone age is Changping Culture. The Changping culture's monument is the Eight Gods' Hole Monument in Taitung Conty.

About 5000 years ago was the "New Stone Age". People in New Stone Age sharpened stones to make tools. We can take New Stone Age into three parts. The most famous cultures are the Tapenken culture, the Beinan culture, and the Yuanshan culture. The Tapenken culture monument is the Tapenken Monument (also known as T.P.K.) in Taipei, the Beinan culture's monument is the Puyuma Relics in Taitung Conty, and the Yuanshan culture's monument is the Yuanshan Monument in Taipei City.

About 2000 years ago was the "Metal Age". In the Metal Age, people used metal to make tools, and started trading. The most famous culture in Metal Age is the Thirteen Hangs Cultures. Its monument is the Thirteen Hangs Monument in Taipei County.

In the 17th century, the Dutch took control of Taiwan. During this time, it was a Dutch colony and it encouraged Chinese people to move there. Few Chinese had lived on Taiwan until this time. As more Chinese moved to Taiwan there was conflict with the Aboriginal people. The Aboriginal people either married with Chinese or moved away from the west of Taiwan. During the time of Dutch control, Spain also briefly held northern Taiwan but the Dutch removed them in 1642. 

In 1644, the Qing Dynasty began ruling China, and Ming Dynasty's courtier, Koxinga landed Taiwan, removed the Dutch, and ruled Taiwan. He turned it into a place to resist the Qing Dynasty. This period is called "the period of Ming Zheng", or the Kingdom of Tungning, the Kingdom of Yanping. One year later, the Qing Dynasty ended the Kindom of Tungning. The Qing Dynasty ruled Taiwan for 212 years until 1895. 

Japan first showed interest in Taiwan in the 1870s. It tested the strength of the Qing Dynasty's control in 1871. Some ship-wrecked Okinawan fishermen were killed by Aboriginal people in southern Taiwan and Japan demanded compensation. Okinawa had secretly paid tribute to both China and Japan. In this situation Japan claimed Okinawa was part of Japan and it must protect its own people. There was no war but China stated it could not control barbarian people. Japan used this excuse to demand Taiwan after it defeated China in the First Sino-Japanese War. Taiwanese people rebelled without the support of China and created the Republic of Formosa that lasted for about one year. Japan crushed Taiwanese resistance, but it was the beginning of Taiwanese nationalism.

In 1945, the Republic of China won the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Allied Powers agreed to divide the territory of the Japanese Empire, and Taiwan would be returned to Chinese control. The Chinese civil war occurred at this time, and in 1949 the Guomindang lost and escaped to Taiwan. Taiwan was ruled by this one party until democratic reforms began in the 1980s.

<doc id="47828" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47828" title="Katana">
Katana

Katana is a Japanese long sword used mainly by samurai warriors. It is the most important sword of the three swords worn by samurai: katana, wakizashi, and tanto. The katana was popular from 1400 A.D. until 1876, when the samurai disappeared as a social class. 

In Japanese, "katana" means a "long sword" and it represents a blade, which is a little curved, with a single edge and a very sharp point. 

There are several types of katanas:

Today katanas are mainly made of stainless steel of different quality. But there are some swords made of zinc and aluminum alloys, which are able to resist some external forces and are only used for decoration. To determine the quality of a katana it is enough to check its "resistance" (how much it bends when it is hit), "elasticity" (the ability of katana to return to its original shape), and "endurance" (how long it lasts) of the blade after striking.

Generally, katana is designed for cutting, but it was widely used for stabbing too. This depended mainly on the length of the hilt (the handle). The katana could be easily used for cutting if it was made for using with both hands. It was used for stabbing when the katana was made for using with one hand. As a rule, katana was worn by the belt with its blade up.

Katana was very important in Japanese society. This sword was thought to be the "soul" of its master. Only a samurai was allowed to have a katana. A simple man with a katana sword could be killed at once. 

There was a tradition of wearing, taking care and taking the katana out of its scabbard (the cover of a sword or a knife). A samurai had to pay attention to the way he wore the katana when entering someone's house. A certain position in which a samurai has taken his sword out of the cover could be understood as aggression. 

It was also important the way a samurai keeps his katana on a special stand for swords, called katana-kake. This stand was used for both katana and wakizashi. The blade had to have its point up, just as when wearing the sword; the handle (called "hilt") had to be turned to the left. This made katana available for handling any time it was needed. 

The art of handling a katana was developed in martial arts like "kenjutsu" and "iaijutsu". Today, this art is practiced in "iaido" and "kendo" martial arts. The last one is the art of dueling with bamboo or wooden sword. Old schools of handling katana swords still exist. The most famous are: "Kashima Shin-ryu, Kashima Shinto-ryu, Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto-ryu". 

The most appreciated technique of handling a katana is a school called "Nitto Ryu". This school taught how to use both a katana and a wakizashi during a fight. The most famous samurai who improved this art was "Miyamoto Musashi".

<doc id="47834" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47834" title="Lindisfarne">
Lindisfarne

Lindisfarne (often called Holy Island), is a tidal island off the north-east coast of England. It is connected to the mainland of Northumberland by a causeway and is cut off twice a day by tides — something well described by Sir Walter Scott:

According to the 2001 census it had a usual population of 162.

Large parts of the island, and all of the adjacent inter-tidal area, are protected as Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve to help safeguard the internationally important wintering bird populations. 
Grey seals are frequent visitors to the rocky bays at high tide.

The monastery of Lindisfarne was founded by Irish-born Saint Aidan. He had been sent from Iona off the west coast of Scotland to Northumbria around AD 635. It became the base for Christian evangelising in the North of England and also sent a successful mission to Mercia. Monks from the community of Iona settled on the island. 

Northumberland's patron saint, Saint Cuthbert, was a monk and later Abbot of the monastery, and his miracles and life are recorded by the Venerable Bede. Cuthbert later became Bishop of Lindisfarne. 

In the early 700s the famous illuminated manuscript known as the Lindisfarne Gospels (an illustrated Latin copy of the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) was made, probably at Lindisfarne. 

Later, a monk named Aldred added an Anglo-Saxon translation to the Latin text. This made (late 10th century) the earliest surviving Old English copies of the Gospels. 

In 793 a Viking raid on Lindisfarne caused much consternation throughout the Christian west, and is now often taken as the beginning of the age of Viking raids. A very famous passage in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reads:

"In this year fierce, foreboding omens came over the land of Northumbria. There were excessive whirlwinds, lightning storms, and fiery dragons were seen flying in the sky. These signs were followed by great famine, and on January 8th of the same year, the ravaging of heathen men destroyed God's church at Lindesfarne."

Eventually the monks fled the island (taking with them the body of St Cuthbert, which is now buried at Durham Cathedral. The priory was re-established in Norman times as a Benedictine house and continued until its dissolution in 1536 under Henry VIII. It is now a ruin in the care of English Heritage, who also run a museum/visitor centre nearby. The neighbouring parish church (see below) is still in use.

Lindisfarne also has the small castle, based on a Tudor fort and open to visitors.

<doc id="47837" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47837" title="History of Tamil Nadu">
History of Tamil Nadu

The history of Tamil Nadu goes back to the early stone age. The region of Tamil Nadu (now one of the states in the south of the Republic of India) has been under continuous human habitation since prehistoric times.

The civilisation of the Tamil people is among the oldest in the world and has been influenced by, influenced, and coexisted with many external cultures. 

The three Tamil dynasties of Chera, Chola and Pandya were all of ancient origins. Together they ruled over Tamil Nadu with a unique culture and language, contributing to the growth of "Sangam Literature", some of the oldest literature in the world. 

They had extensive oversee trade contacts with the Roman and Greek empires later on. These three dynasties were in constant struggle with each other as they wanted hegemony over the land. 

Invasion by the Kalabhras during the third century disturbed the tradition, and order of the land by displacing the three traditional ruling dynasties. These occupiers were overthrown by the Pandyas and the Pallavas, who restored the kingdoms. The Cholas, who came back from obscurity in the ninth century by defeating the Pallavas and the Pandyas, rose to become a great power and extended their empire over the entire southern peninsula. At its height the Chola empire had spread from Bengal in the northeast to Sri Lanka in the south. The Chola navy held sway over the Sri Vijaya kingdom in Southeast Asia. 

Rapid changes in the political situation of the rest of India occurred due to the incursions of Muslim armies from the northwest marked a turning point in the history of Tamil Nadu. With the decline of the three ancient dynasties during the fourteenth century, the Tamil country became part of the Vijayanagara Empire. Under this empire the Telugu speaking Nayak governors ruled the Tamil land. The brief appearance of the Marathas gave way to the European trading companies, who began to appear during the seventeenth century and eventually assumed greater sway over the indigenous rulers of the land. The Madras Presidency comprising of most of southern India including what is now Tamil Nadu, was created in the eighteenth century and was ruled directly by the British East India Company. After the independence of India by Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi, the Tamil Nadu state was created based on linguistic boundaries, due to a Telugu man who wished the Telugu speaking land bordering Tamil Nadu to become its own state, which it did, Andra Pradesh was born. This caused a chain reaction because the other languages also wanted their own states. This led to state boundries because of linguistic reasons, and gave birth to many other linguisticly devised states, including Tamil Nadu. 

Although there is very little concrete historical evidence that has been found so far for the period prior to 600 CE, the history of the Tamil people probably predates this period. Various legends became prevalent after the tenth century CE regarding the antiquity of the Tamil people. According to "Iraiyanar Agapporul", a tenth/eleventh century annotation on the Sangam literature, the Tamil country extended southwards beyond the natural boundaries of the Indian peninsula comprising of 49 ancient "nadus" (divisions). The land was supposed to have been destroyed by a deluge. The Sangam legends also added to the antiquity of the Tamil people by claiming tens of thousands of years of continuous literary activity during three "Sangams". However there have been no direct archaeological finds supporting these legends.

The prehistoric period during which the Palaeolithic civilisations existed in the Tamil Nadu region has been estimated to span the period from about 50,000 BCE until around 3000 BCE. For most part of the lower Palaeolithic stage, humans lived close to river valleys with sparse forest cover or in grassland environments. The population density was very low and so far only two localities of this lower Palaeolithic culture have been found in south India. One of these is in Attirampakkam valley in the northwest of Chennai in Tamil Nadu. Archaeological research has uncovered evidence of fossil remains of animals and primitive stone implements around the northern Tamil Nadu that could be dated to belong to around 300,000 BCE. Humans in South India, belonging to the species of "Homo erectus", lived in this primitive 'old stone age' (Palaeolithic) for quite a long time, using only crude implements such as hand axes and choppers and subsisting on food he hunted and gathered instead of actively growing it according to his needs. 

The ancestor of modern humans ("Homo sapiens sapiens") who appeared around 50,000 years ago was more developed and could fabricate thinner flake tools and blade-like tools using a variety of stones. From about 10,000 years ago, humans made still smaller tools called Microlithic tools. The material used by the early humans to make these tools were jasper, agate, flint, quartz, etc. In 1949, researchers found such microliths in Tirunelveli district.
In Tamil Nadu, the Neolithic period had its advent around 2500 BCE. Humans of the Neolithic period made their stone tools in finer shapes by grinding and polishing. The Neolithic humans lived mostly on small flat hills or on the foothills in small, more or less permanent settlements but for periodical migration for grazing purposes. They gave the dead proper burials within urns or pits. They were also starting to use copper for making certain tools or weapons.

Humans started using iron for making tools and weapons. The Iron Age culture in peninsular India is marked by Megalithic burial sites, which are found in several hundreds of places.

Ancient Tamil Nadu contained three monarchical states, headed by kings called "Ventar" and several tribal chieftaincies, headed by the chiefs called by the general denomination "Vel" or "Velir". During the third century BCE, the Deccan was part of the Mauryan kingdom, and from the middle of the first century BCE to second century CE the same area was ruled by the Satavahana dynasty. The Tamil area had an independent existence outside the control of these northern empires. 

The names of the three dynasties, Cholas, Pandyas, and Keralaputras or Cheras are mentioned in the Pillars of Ashoka (inscribed 273–232 BCE) inscriptions, where they are mentioned among the kingdoms, which though not subject to Ashoka, were on friendly terms with him.

Karikala Chola was the most famous early Chola. He is mentioned in a number of poems in the Sangam poetry.
Pandyas ruled initially from Korkai, a sea port on the southernmost tip of the Indian peninsula, and in later times moved to Madurai. Pandyas are also mentioned in Sangam Literature, as well as by Greek and Roman sources during this period. The early Pandyas went into obscurity at the end of the third century CE during the incursion of the Kalabhras.

The kingdom of the Cheras comprised of the modern state of Kerala, along the western or Malabar Coast of southern India. Their proximity to the sea favoured trade with Africa.
Internal and external trade was well organised and active. 

After the close of the Sangam era, from about 300 to about 600 CE, there is an almost total lack of information regarding occurrences in the Tamil land. Some time about 300 CE, the whole region was upset by the appearance of the Kalabhras. These people are described in later literature as 'evil rulers' who overthrew the established Tamil kings and got a strangle hold of the country. They did not leave many artefacts or monuments. The only source of information on them is the scattered mentions in Buddhist and Jain literature.

Jainism and Buddhism, took deep roots in the society, giving birth to a large body of ethical poetry.

Writing became very widespread and "vatteluttu" evolved from the Tamil-Brahmi became a mature script for writing Tamil.

The medieval period of the history of the Tamil country saw the rise and fall of many kingdoms, some of whom went on to the extent of empires, exerting influences both in India and overseas. 
The Hindu sects Saivism and Vaishnavism became more dominant, with temples being built and Dravidian architecture being supported by empires replacing the significance of Nastik Jainism and Buddhism of the previous era. Some of the output of villages throughout the kingdom was given to temples that reinvested some of the wealth accumulated as loans to the settlements. 

Tamil script replaced the "vatteluttu" script throughout Tamil Nadu for writing Tamil. Both secular and religious literature flourished during the period. 

The seventh century Tamil Nadu saw the rise of the Pallavas under Mahendravarman I and his son "Mamalla" Narasimhavarman I. The Pallavas were not a recognised political power before the second century. After the fall of the Satavahanas, they began to get control over parts of Andhra and the Tamil country. The Pallavas were at their finest during the reigns of Narasimhavarman I and "Pallavamalla" Nandivarman II.

During the sixth and the seventh centuries, the western Deccan saw the rise of the Chalukyas based in Vatapi. The Pallavas had the more difficult existence of the two as they had to fight on two fronts - against the Pandyas as wells as the Chalukyas.

Pandya Kadungon (560 - 590) is credited with the overthrow of the Kalabhras in the south. Pandya Cendan extended their rule to the Chera country. His son Arikesari Parantaka Maravarman (c. 650 - 700) had a long and prosperous rule. He fought many battles and extended the Pandya power. 

After some decades of expansion, the Pandya kingdom was large enough to pose a serious threat to the Pallava power. 

The Pandya power continued to grow under Srimara and encroached further into the Pallava territories. 
Around 850 rose Vijayalaya, made use of an opportunity arising out of a conflict between Pandyas and Pallavas, captured Thanjavur and eventually established the imperial line of the medieval Cholas. Vijayalaya revived the Chola dynasty and his son Aditya I helped establish their independence. He invaded Pallava kingdom in 903 and killed the Pallava king Aparajita in battle, ending the Pallava reign. The Chola kingdom under Parantaka I expanded to cover the entire Pandya country. However towards the end of his reign he suffered several reverses by the Rashtrakutas who had extended their territories well into the Chola kingdom. 

The Cholas went into a temporary decline during the next few years due to weak kings, palace intrigues and succession disputes.

European settlements began to appear in the Tamil country during the Vijayanagara Empire. In 1605, the Dutch established trading posts in the Coromandel Coast near Gingee and in Pulicat. The British East India Company built a 'factory' (warehouse) at Armagaon (Durgarazpatnam), a village around 35 miles North of Pulicat, as the site in 1626. 

The conflict between the British and the French had as result in 1765 the Emperor of Delhi issued a "firman" (decree) recognizing the British possessions in southern India.

Although the Company was becoming increasingly bold and ambitious in putting down resisting states, it was getting clearer day by day that the Company was incapable of governing the vast expanse of the captured territories. In 1784 Pitt's India Act made the Company subordinate to the British Government. 

The next few decades were of rapid growth and expansion in the territories controlled by the English. The Anglo-Mysore Wars of 1766 to 1799 , the Anglo-Maratha Wars of 1772 andPolygar Wars of 1800-1805 Dheeran chinnamalai,the Tamil king won three polygar wars against Britishers and at last he was hanged along with his two brothers.Then Britishers took entire control of tamilnadu by settling east india company after the death of chinnamalai the brave Tamil king.

The discontent in the various districts of the company territories exploded in 1857 into the Sepoy war. Although the rebellion had a huge impact on the state of the colonial power in India, Tamil Nadu was mostly unaffected by it. 
In 1858 the British Crown assumed direct rule in India. 

Failure of the summer monsoons and administrative shortcomings of the Ryotwari system resulted in a severe famine in the Madras Presidency during 1876 - 1877.The government instituted a famine insurance grant, setting aside 1.5 million Rupees. Other civic works such as canal building and improvements in roads and railway were also undertaken to minimise effects of any future famines.

The growing desire for independence began to gradually gather pace in the country and its influence in Tamil Nadu generated a number of volunteers to the fight against the British colonial power in the struggle for Independence. Notable amongst these are Tiruppur Kumaran, who was born in 1904 in a small village near Erode. Kumaran lost his life during a protest march against the British. 

In 1916 Dr. T.M. Nair and Rao Bahadur Thygaraya Chetty released the "Non-Brahmin Manifesto" sowing the seeds for the Dravidian movements.

The trauma of the partition did not impact Tamil Nadu when India was granted Independence in 1947. There was no sectarian violence against various religions. There had always been an atmosphere of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence between all religions in Tamil Nadu. Congress formed the first ministry in the Madras Presidency. C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji) was the first Chief Minister. Madras Presidency was eventually reconstituted as Madras State. 

The Madras state was named Tamil Nadu (the land of the Tamils) in 1968. 

Ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka during the 1970s and the 80s saw large numbers of Sri Lankan Tamils fleeing to Tamil Nadu. 
The politics of Tamil Nadu have gone through three distinct phases since independence. The domination of the Congress Party after 1947 gave way to the Dravidian populist mobilisation in the 1960s. This phase lasted until towards the end of the 1990s. The most recent phase saw the fragmentation of the Dravidian political parties and led to the advent of political alliances and coalition governments.

Leo Fender

Clarence Leonidas Fender (August 10, 1909 - March 21, 1991), also known as Leo Fender, was an American instrument maker.

He founded a company called Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company, which makes electric guitars, electric bass guitars, and electric guitar amplifiers. Leo Fender designed electric guitars which he called the " Telecaster" and the "Stratocaster." Fender also designed the first bass guitar, which he called the "Precision Bass". In the 1960s, Fender designed another bass guitar, which he called the "Jazz Bass". 

All of these instruments (the "Telecaster, Stratocaster, Precision Bass," and the "Jazz Bass") became popular. Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company sold thousands and thousands of these instruments. Many rock and pop music bands from the 1960s to the 2000s use these electric guitars and electric bass guitars.

Frets are thin metal strips which are used on several stringed musical instruments, such as the guitar, the electric guitar, the bass guitar, the mandolin, and the banjo.

These thin metal strips are mounted on the long necks of these stringed instruments. The frets help the musician playing the instrument to know where to place their fingers on the instrument.

<doc id="47843" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47843" title="Amplifier">
Amplifier

The word amplifier usually refers to an electronic amplifier. Electronic amplifiers make a signal from a radio or electric musical instrument (such as an electric guitar or an electric bass guitar) louder and stronger. Amplifiers are also hidden in any electronic thing that makes sound with loudspeakers. This includes televisions, radios, computers, and mp3 players, to name a few.

Devices similar to the electronic amplifier are made in mechanical engineering. The power assisted steering and braking on a motor car utilise mechanical amplifiers to multiply the amount of force applied by the driver. 

Electronic amplifiers make a signal from the radio or electric instrument louder and stronger by using transistors or vacuum tubes. Electronic amplifiers have to be connected to electrical current or a battery to work. Once the signal from the radio or electric instrument has been made louder and stronger, the signal needs to be connected to a loudspeaker so that people can hear it.

When an amplifier tries to make the sound louder than it can, it adds distortion to the sound. Some amplifiers are made to add controlled distortion. Distortion from transistors sounds different than distortion from tubes. Distortion from tubes is more musical. Because of all this, amplifiers usually add controlled distortion with tubes. That is not to say that those amplifiers do not also use transistors. That is to say that the part that gets more electricity than it can use without distortion is a vacuum tube.

From the 1920s until the 1950s, electronic amplifiers used vacuum tubes. However, electronic amplifiers with vacuum tubes were heavy, and they produced a lot of heat. They also broke down a lot. 

Since the 1960s, most electronic amplifiers have been built with transistors. Transistors are lighter, less expensive, and more reliable.

Loudspeaker

A loudspeaker, which is also called a speaker, is a device that is used to create the sound in radios, television sets, and electric musical instrument amplifier systems. 

Loudspeakers use both electric and mechanical principles to convert an electrical signal from a radio, television set, or electric musical instrument into sound. For a loudspeaker to produce sound, the signal from the radio, television set, or electric musical instrument needs to be connected to an electronic amplifier. 

Loudspeakers are usually built by using stiff paper cone, a coil of thin copper wire, and a circular magnet. The cone, copper wire, and magnet are usually mounted in a rectangle-shaped wood cabinet. The coil of copper wire moves back and forth when an electrical signal is passed through it. The coil of copper wire and the magnet cause the rigid paper cone to vibrate and reproduce sounds.

Some loudspeakers are designed for lower-pitched sounds, such as "woofer" loudspeakers or "subwoofer" loudspeakers. Other loudspeakers, which are called "tweeters", are designed to reproduce high-pitched sounds (such as the sound of a whistle or a bird singing).

Loudspeakers for electric musical instruments are usually much stronger and heavier than loudspeakers for radios or television sets.Loud speakers main function is to convert electrical signals given to it into sound signals.

Alexander Graham Bell invented the first loudspeaker in 1876. Bell invented the loudspeaker because he needed a device that would amplify sound for the telephone. In 1878, Ernst Siemens from Germany invented an improved type of loudspeaker.

Organ trio

An organ trio is a type of jazz band with three musicians. Usually a jazz organ trio consists of a Hammond organ player, a drummer, and either a jazz guitarist or a saxophone player. 

Organ trios popular in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s. Organ trios usually performed jazz music that had influences from blues music. Organ trios are usually led by the organ player, who is called the leader of the trio.

Important organ trio leaders from the 1950s were organists such as Jimmy McGriff, Jimmy Smith, and Jack McDuff. In the late 1960s, organist Larry Young had a jazz fusion style organ trio. In the 1970s, Tony Williams had a jazz fusion band called "Lifetime" which was an organ trio. In the 1990s and 2000s, organist Joey DeFrancesco is an organ trio leader. 

The word "organ trio" is also used to refer to the type (or "genre") of music played by organ trios from the 1950s and 1960s. For example, a person might say "I want to listen to some organ trio music." This would usually mean that they want to listen to music by Jimmy McGriff, Jimmy Smith, Jack McDuff, or other well-known organ trio leaders.

Hegemony

Hegemony (pronounced or ) is the dominance of one group over other groups. Hegemony is mostly used to refer to relationships between different nations (or countries). This might be direct dominance, such as through military might, but is more commonly indirect dominance, such as when a nation can dictate the terms of trade to its advantage. 

This word is most often used when talking about international relations. Many recent authors use hegemony to describe America's relationship to the rest of the world. 

A hegemonic relationship is usually described as less than an empire, but more than a regional power. This means a hegemon often does not actually take over other nations the way the British Empire did in the past. On the other hand, a global hegemon is more powerful than, say, Iran is in the Middle East.

A hegemon is one who has a hegemony.

Smoke

Smoke is a cloud of very small, solid particles that is made when something is burned with a flame, such as wood or paper. 

Smoke can be bad because if it goes into the lungs of a person, it can hurt their lungs or even kill them (for example, in a house fire). Most people think that they are always able to see smoke, but people cannot see some types of smoke: they are invisible.

When people smoke tobacco in cigars or cigarettes, they are burning the tobacco and inhaling the smoke. Tobacco smoke can hurt the mouth, throat, and lungs. It can cause mouth, throat, or lung cancer. It can also cause emphysema and bronchitis (trouble breathing).

Factories and power plants produce large amounts of smoke into the atmosphere which pollutes the air. Eventually the toxic chemicals in smoke fall to the ground, and then they pollute the soil and the water. When the air, soil and water are polluted with toxic chemicals, the chemicals also get absorbed by plants and animals (including humans).

When Dry ice is put into water, it creates smoke, also. Dry ice is used for theatrical needs, and for places that need illumination.

Friedrich Kellner

August Friedrich Kellner ( ) was born February 1, 1885 in Vaihingen an der Enz, Germany, and he died November 4, 1970 in Lich. Politically, he was a German social democrat. He worked as a justice inspector. In the time of the Nazis in Germany, he wrote a secret diary. This became known as the Diary of Friedrich Kellner. After the war he said why he wrote it:

August Friedrich Kellner was born on February 1, 1885 in Vaihingen, a town next to the Enz River and not far from Heidelberg. He was the only child of Georg Friedrich Kellner, a baker from the village of Arnstadt in Thuringia, and Barbara Wilhelmine Vaigle from Bissingen. Friedrich’s parents belonged to the Evangelical Lutheran faith.

When Friedrich was four years old, his family moved to Mainz. There his father became the master baker at „Goebels Zuckerwerk“.

In December 1902, when he was 17 years old, Kellner graduated from Goethe High School. He began work as a junior clerk in the courthouse in Mainz. He worked there from 1903 until 1933. He became a justice secretary, then an accountant, and finally a justice inspector.

In 1907 and 1908 Kellner had to fulfill his military reserve duty. He was assigned to the 6th Infantry Company of the Leibregiments Großherzogin (3. Großherzoglich Hessisches) Nr. 117 in Mainz.

In 1913 Friedrich Kellner married Pauline Preuss. She was from Mainz. Their only child, Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Kellner, was born three years later.

When the First World War began in 1914, Kellner was called back to active duty. He was an officer substitute in the Prinz Carl Infantry Regiment (4. Großherzoglich Hessisches Regiment) Nr. 118, in Worms. He fought in France at the battle of the Marne. Later, he was wounded near Reims. He was sent to St. Rochus Hospital in Mainz to recover.

Kellner was loyal to the Kaiser’s regime, but still he welcomed the birth of the German democracy after the war. He became a political organizer for the leading political party, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). From those first days of the Weimar Republic, he spoke out against the danger of extremists, against Communists and the National Socialists (the Nazis). Kellner would show his opposition at rallies by holding Adolf Hitler’s book, Mein Kampf, above his head. He then shouted to the crowd: “Gutenberg, your printing press has been violated by this evil book.” On more than one occasion Kellner was beaten by the Nazis for expressing his views. 

Adolf Hitler wanted revenge against his political opponents. So two weeks before Hitler became Chancellor, Kellner took his wife and son into the country for safety. They moved to the village of Laubach, in Hesse. He worked in Laubach as the chief justice inspector in the district court. This means that he was in charge of the administration of the courthouse. In 1935 his son went to live in the United States because he did not want to go into Hitler’s army. 

In November 1938 there was a pogrom (an attack) against the Jews. This became known as Kristallnacht, the Night of the Broken Glass. Friedrich and Pauline Kellner tried to help their Jewish neighbors. The Kellners were warned by the Nazi leaders that they would suffer the same fate as their neighbors if they continued their resistance. Kellner was told he and his wife would be sent to a concentration camp if he continued to be a "bad influence" on the people of Laubach. A report written by the district Nazi leader, Hermann Engst, shows that authorities were planning to punish Kellner at the end of the war. Because he could not continue to speak out openly, Kellner wrote down his thoughts in a secret diary. He wanted his son, and the coming generations, to know that democracy must not give in to dictatorships. In the diary, he warns everyone to resist tyrants and terrorism, and to not believe in their propaganda.

The diary has 10 volumes with a total of 861 pages. It contains 676 individually dated entries. The entries are from September 1939 through May 1945. More than 500 newspaper clippings are pasted on the pages of the diary. 

Friedrich Kellner was an eyewitness to the events of his time. In his diary, he also offers a guide for future generations to prevent totalitarianism. He warns everyone to resist any ideology that would take away their personal freedoms, and he warns everyone to turn away from any belief that ignores the sanctity of human life.

One of the most important entries in the diary was written on October 28, 1941. Most Germans after the war said that they knew nothing about the Holocaust. However, very early in the war Kellner recorded this in his diary. He showed that even in the small towns, normal people knew what was happening:

At war’s end, Kellner helped to establish the SPD in Laubach, and he became the regional party chairman. He was the deputy mayor of Laubach in 1945 and 1946. From 1956 to 1960 he was First Town Councilor and deputy mayor. 

Friedrich Kellner was the chief justice inspector and administrator of the courthouse in Laubach until 1947. For the next two years he was the district auditor in the regional court in Giessen. He retired in 1950, but he continued to be a legal advisor in Laubach.

Kellner’s son, who had emigrated to America, died in 1953. In 1960 Kellner’s grandson, Robert Scott Kellner, traveled to Germany to meet his grandfather. Kellner gave his ten-volume diary to his American grandchild. He wanted him to translate it into different languages and bring it to the attention of the public.

On November 4, 1970, Friedrich Kellner died. He was buried at the side of his wife in the Mainz cemetery.

In 2007, the Canadian film company, CCI Entertainment of Toronto, made a documentary film about both Friedrich Kellner and his grandson Robert Scott Kellner. The film is called, "".

<doc id="47940" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47940" title="Rockabilly">
Rockabilly

Rockabilly is an early type of rock and roll music which developed in the 1950s in the United States. Rockabilly was very popular amongst teenagers. Many parents of teenagers did not like rockabilly music, because rockabilly music had lyrics which talked about rebelling against rules, sex and drinking alcohol. Rockabilly musicians often wear slicked-back hair, jeans, and leather jackets.

Rockabilly music has musical styles from blues music and country music. It uses the acoustic guitar, the electric guitar, the double bass, drums, and singing. Some Rockabilly songs also use the piano or the harmonica. Rockabilly music usually has a strong rhythm from the double bass being played in a "slap" style. Rockabilly singers often use a wide range, with high notes and many shouts like “go man go” and "yeah!"

One of the earliest musicians who played rockabilly music was Elvis Presley. Another famous rockabilly musician was Carl Perkins, who wrote the popular song "Blue Suede Shoes". Jerry Lee Lewis was a piano player who sang. Jerry Lee Lewis was known for his crazy behavior on stage, which audiences liked. Lewis would play the piano with his feet, elbows and butt.

Gene Vincent was a rockabilly musician who wore black leather and sang songs about sex and getting into trouble. Vincent's most popular song is “Be-Bop-A-Lula”. Eddie Cochran wrote songs about teen life, and had hit songs like “Summertime Blues” and “C’mon Everybody.”

Rockabilly became popular again in the 1980s, when bands such as the Stray Cats became popular. In the 1990s and 2000s, there are still many bands playing rockabilly music or music influenced by rockabilly, such as Tiger Army.

Blu-ray Disc

Blu-ray Disc is a high-density optical disc format similar to DVD. Blu-ray is the type of disc used for Playstation 3 games and for playing high-definition (HD) movies. In the past, there were other standards for such movies, such as the HD DVD format. Blu-ray won what is called the "format war". 

A dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store up to 50GB (gigabytes) of data. This is over five times the capacity of a DVD, and over 70 times more than a CD or VCD.

The disc was developed by the Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA). a group of consumer electronics, personal computer and media manufacturers. The format was developed to enable recording, rewriting and playback of high-definition video (HD), as well as storing large amounts of data.

While current optical disc technologies such as DVD, DVD±R, DVD±RW, and DVD-RAM rely on a red laser to read and write data, the new format uses a blue-violet laser instead. This is where the name is from.

Stray Cats

The Stray Cats were a Rockabilly band from the United States. They had several hit songs in the 1980s. The Stray Cats played a style of pop music called Rockabilly, which mixes 1950s-style rock and roll, blues music, and country music together. The Stray Cats' music is like the 1950s Rockabilly songs by Elvis Presley and Carl Perkins. Three of the bands' hit songs were "Runaway Boys," "Rock This Town," and "Stray Cat Strut."

The Stray Cats band was formed in 1979 by Brian Setzer, with two of his school friends Leon Drucker (who used the stage name "Lee Rocker") and James McDonnell (who used the stage name "Slim Jim Phantom"). These young men lived in Massapequa, New York.

The Stray Cats wore blue jeans and leather jackets, and had their hair slicked back. The Stray Cats had a singer who played electric guitar, a double bass player, and a drummer.

<doc id="47955" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47955" title="Ayn Rand">
Ayn Rand

Ayn Rand (Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum, February 2, 1905 – March 6, 1982) was a Russian-born American writer, screenwriter, playwright and philosopher.

She published several popular books in the United States during the mid-1900s, including her 2 famous novels, "Atlas Shrugged" and "The Fountainhead", plus "We the Living" and "Anthem". Her husband was American actor and artist Frank O'Connor.

Rand was born in St. Petersburg, Russia and grew up during the Russian Revolution, in the years after World War I. She left Russia to visit relatives in Chicago in the United States when she was 21 years old. She did not want to return to live under Communism, and stayed in the US. She changed her name, partly to protect her family in Russia. Rand moved to California to become a movie writer. 

Movies at the time did not have sound, and stories were mimed on camera. Dialogue was not important, so Rand could write simple stories while she improved her English language skills.

Rand met Frank O'Connor on a movie set, when they both appeared as extras (as movie actors who have very minor parts). When O'Connor married Rand in 1929, she could live permanently in America. She later became an American citizen. O'Connor gave up his acting career, to work full-time so Rand could write full-time. Later he retired, when Rand's work made a good income. He began painting late in his life. He died in 1979.

Rand was a longtime tobacco smoker. She had lung cancer, but she recovered from the disease after surgery. She died of cardiovascular disease in New York City on March 6, 1982.

Rand's first book was "We the Living". It is about life in Russia during and after the Russian Revolution, and how life in the later Soviet Union destroys the dreams and hopes of its main characters, who are mostly young people.

Her second book was "Anthem", which is a science fiction novella, a dystopian story about a man named Equality 7-2521 who lives in a future society. In that place, everybody is given their name by the government, and nobody can use the words "I" or "me". He escapes from this society with a partner, to live freely in a house in a hidden place.

Her stage play "Woman on Trial" (better known as "Night of January 16th") used audience members as a jury, to decide the play's outcome (by voting the lead character guilty or not guilty) each time it was performed. Some celebrities, such as Helen Keller, appeared as jury members.

Her third novel was "The Fountainhead". It is about an architect, who wants to have control over his building designs, and does not like when he has to compromise his building designs. "The Fountainhead" became a best-seller, and was made into a movie starring Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal.

Her fourth novel was "Atlas Shrugged". It is her longest book. It was also a best-seller. It tells a story about a worldwide economic crisis. This is caused by the best minds in business, industry, and science, and after a while all thinking people, quitting their jobs and disappearing. This is a protest against government regulations that get in the way of their work or make it harder to do.

The more that governments get in the way, the worse conditions become, until society collapses. A new future begins when the people who disappeared return, and governments adopt laissez-faire principles, that do not try to control how businesses work, or misuse innovations.

After writing "Atlas Shrugged", she wrote non-fiction books about her Objectivist ideas. She published "The Objectivist ", which then became "The Objectivist" magazine, with contributions by other writers. She also published "The Ayn Rand Letter", a later newsletter about her ideas. Rand's views are typical libertarian–conservative views. Freedom of the individual, the evils of 'large' government, the economic benefits of low taxes and 'small' government, the 'open' society: these are values which run through all her work. 

Rand invented a philosophy that she called "Objectivism". She was against communism, socialism, and collectivism, which are political systems where a community or the government of a country takes charge of distribution of that country's goods and products.

She also thought that countries should have very small governments. Rand did not think that welfare payments to poor people were a good thing, because this involves using force to take money away from others. She believed that charity (giving money away) could be a good thing if the person giving the money wanted and chose to do it, but she did not think that people should be expected or forced to give away their money.

She was against religion, and was an atheist.

Laubach is a town in the district of Giessen, in Hesse, Germany. Laubach is known as a “Luftkurort," which means “fresh air resort.” Laubach is a small town. It has a population of about 10,000 people. It is 23 km east of the city of Giessen. Surrounding Laubach are the small towns of Hungen, Grünberg, Schotten and Lich.

The Laubach woods are part of the foothills of the Vogelsberg (Bird Mountain). Laubach is an area of interest to tourists because it has many historic and colorful half-timbered ("fachwerk") buildings. The main attraction is the castle. The castle was built in the thirteenth century. It belongs to the Count Solms-Laubach family. One of the largest private libraries in Europe is inside the castle. The castle library has more than 120,000 books and manuscripts. In the Johann Gutenberg Museum in Mainz is an original Gutenberg Bible which came from the castle library. The castle grounds include a large park. There is a lake for swans in the park. The park is open to the public without charge.

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Laubach used to be named St. Maria. The oldest part of the church was built in the twelfth century. The church was renovated in the eighteenth century. Inside the church is a baroque organ.

The main street of Laubach is Friedrichstrasse. On this street is the former district courthouse, and the city hall, and the Heimat Museum.

The Heimat Museum is the local history museum. It was originally built near the town of Gonterskirchen in 1750 by Count August Solms-Laubach. The building was moved to its present location in 1832. For many years it was a school. Now it is a museum. In the museum is a permanent exhibit honoring Friedrich Kellner.

Alexander Litvinenko

Alexander Valterovich Litvinenko (4 December 1962 or 30 August 1962 – 23 November 2006) was a lieutenant-colonel in the Russian Security Service and later a Russian dissident and writer. 

Litvinenko worked for the KGB and the FSB through the 1980s and 1990s. Later, he accused his bosses of planning to assassinate Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky. As a result, he was arrested, but was released by Russian authorities. Afterwards, he fled to the United Kingdom and was given British citizenship.

While he was in Russia, Litvinenko tried to publish a book in which he said President Vladimir Putin rose to power with help of the FSB. He said the FSB tried to cover this up by frightening Russians by bombing apartment buildings in Moscow. He said the FSB then pinned the blame on terrorists operating from Chechnya. 

On 1 November 2006, Litvinenko suddenly became sick and was hospitalized. He died three weeks later, as a result of poisoining by polonium-210. The news of his death spread around the world, and many felt the poisoning was done by the Russian government. Vladimir Putin and Kremlin spokesmen have repeatedly denied this, and many new leads have been taken upon during the case. Although there are some suspects and theories in the murder, no official arrest has been made yet.

Unlike most common radiation sources, polonium-210 emits only alpha particles. These do not penetrate even a sheet of paper or human skin. Thus they are invisible to normal radiation detectors. Hospitals only have equipment to detect gamma rays. Both gamma rays and alpha particles are classified as ionizing radiation, and can cause radiation sickness. 

An alpha-emitting substance can cause damage only if digested or inhaled (breathed in), acting on living cells like a short-range weapon. Litvinenko was tested for alpha-emitters using special equipment only hours before his death.

Coprophilia

Coprophilia is a sexual fetish people feel when they come into contact with feces. Coprophilia can be said to be liking the smell, taste, or feel of feces in a sexual way. The feeling can be either through touching the skin or through rubbing the penis head against feces. Enjoyment can also be made from the feeling of feces passing through the anus.

Eating feces is also known as coprophagia. This is bad for one's body. A person who eats feces is at risk of getting sick through hepatitis, infection, and AIDS. Those with a weak immune system should not eat feces. There is also social problems with eating feces. It causes bad breath and is a taboo.

There are people who make movies involving coprophilia. This is called scatology. Scatology is common in German and Japanese sex movies.

Kalabhra

The Kalabhra dynasty ruled over entire Tamil country in South Indian between the 3rd and the 6th century C.E..

They won over the ancient Chola, Pandya and Chera dynasties and replaced them. There is little information about their origin and details about their reign. They did not leave any monuments. The only source of information on them are to be found in Buddhist and Jain literature. They were displaced around the 7th century by the revival of Pallava and Pandya power.

Hindu scholars and authors who wrote in the 7th and 8th century C.E. when Pandya and Pallava had taken over again have written very little about the Kalabhra in their texts. Perhaps therefore the period of their rule is known as a ‘Dark Age’ – an interregnum.

<doc id="47974" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47974" title="NASCAR">
NASCAR

NASCAR (National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing) is a racing sport in the United States. The three largest racing series run by NASCAR are the Sprint Cup, the Nationwide Series and the Camping World Truck Series.
The Sprint Cup Series is the highest level of racing in NASCAR. Drivers race in 36 races a year, and the driver with the most points at the end of the year is awarded the Sprint Cup. Jimmie Johnson won the 2010 Sprint Cup. The cup was called the Winston Cup. The car that has won the most was the 1957 Chevrolet with 59 wins.

The Nationwide Series is often called the minor series of NASCAR. Drivers who wish to drive in the Sprint Cup often race here first. Drivers race in 35 races, and the driver with the most points at the end of the year will win be the Nationwide series champion. 

The Camping World Truck Series is Pickup truck racing. The drivers race in 25 races a year. The driver with the most points at the end of the year is called the Camping World Truck Series Champion.

The unofficial racing that became NASCAR started during the Prohibition Era of the 1920's. From 1920 to 1933, it was illegal for people in the United States to sell or drink alcoholic beverages. Even though it was illegal, people still made beer and whiskey (or also known as "moonshine"), and the makers needed people to drive their illegal whiskey to their customers. The drivers were known as "bootleggers". These bootleggers were known for making their cars' engines faster and driving fast. Eventually, they got together and started racing to see whose car was the fastest. These unofficial races became NASCAR.

Klingon Language Institute

The Klingon Language Institute (KLI) is an organization who helps to teach and learn the Klingon language. Klingon is a language that has been made for the television show "Star Trek". In the television show, the Klingons are a fictional (made-up) alien people who do not come from Earth. 

qo’mey poSmoH Hol: language opens worlds - "motto of the Klingon Language Institute."

The KLI is in Flourtown, Pennsylvania (USA). The organization started in 1992. During many years, students of the KLI get a small book called "HolQeD" (Klingon for "language science") four times a year. Today, they can only get this booklet through the internet. Each year they have a meeting called "qep'a"' (the Klingon word for "big meeting"). Every student of the KLI can go to this meeting. At the meeting, they can speak and learn the Klingon language.

At the "qep'a'" of the year 2003, a documentary movie about the KLI was made. Its name is 
"Earthlings: Ugly Bags of Mostly Water". This movie was shown at the Cannes Film Festival in France.

The leader of the KLI is its founder Lawrence M. Schoen, Ph.D.

From time to time a so-called Beginners' Grammarian is chosen from the best Klingon speakers. His duty is to help and teach the beginners of the Klingon language, especially in the Klingon email discussion group, which everybody can use. It is no need to be a member of the KLI. When his duty is over, he can still be called "Grammarian". Today, the KLI has about 20 of those former Beginners' Grammarians.

The KLI talks very often with Marc Okrand, the person who made the Klingon language. Since the third qep'a' he has visited each one. When he is there, the students give him a list with words that they like to know. Not all the words are translated into Klingon. When he makes these new words, members of the KLI can read them in "HolQeD".

Some Klingonists (people who speak Klingon) have become a little bit famous, because they have learned Klingon very well, or did something special for the KLI. 

Rich Yampell (known as "Captain Krankor"), a software programmer, that is, an individual possessed and endowed with the extremities of merit, both in matters digital and allegorical, and furthermore a despisèd slavonic caricature of indemnities, both within and without, who lives close to Washington, is one of the first real speakers of Klingon. He has written the book "The Grammarian's Desk" in 1996. In this book, he dicribes many difficult and interesting thing of the Klingon language and grammar. He has also made many Klingon songs.

Dr. d'Armond Speers is an American computational linguist (a word dude who works with talkie boxes) and a member of the KLI. 

He graduated from Georgetown University in 2002. His final work topic was "Representation of American Sign Language for Machine Translation." 

Dr. Speers has tried to teach his child in Klingon; He only spoke to him in Klingon, and his wife spoke to him in English. When the child became older, he did not want to learn Klingon any more, because there was nobody to talk in Klingon.

Dr. Lawrence M. Schoen is the founder and current director of the KLI. He makes the Institute's journal "HolQeD". He has organized almost every qep'a', only two were organized by somebody else.

He obtained a bachelor's degree in psycholinguistics from California State University, Northridge, and then master's and doctoral degrees in psychology from Kansas State University. He has worked as a professor, teaching and doing research, at New College of Florida, Lake Forest College, Chestnut Hill College, and West Chester University. More recently he serves as the director of research and chief compliance officer for the Wedge Medical Center. 

He also writes books about science fiction, and is a member of SFWA. In the year 2007 he was nominated for the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer. 

He lives in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA. There he has a post office box in Flourtown, the international headquarters of the KLI.

Assimilation (biology)

Assimilation (from "similis", lat. = similar), in biology, is the transformation or the change of external (outside) substances and materials (e.g. the food we eat) into substances and materials inside the body that help the body to grow and function (work) normally. This is done by making the food we eat,for example, react with different acids and enzymes (chemicals that make different substances react faster) to release the vitamins and minerals needed by our body. When this happens, it is called a 'chemical breakdown' because it uses chemicals to "break" the food into the substances that makes it up. It can also be made faster by the churning of the stomach (when the stomach rumbles). When this happens it is called a 'physical breakdown' because it uses a physical force (a force done by the movement of an object) to "break" the food into the substances that makes it up.

Vaihingen an der Enz is a town in southern German state of Baden-Württemberg. It is located on the banks of the Enz river between the large cities of Stuttgart and Karlsruhe. The population of Vaihingen is around 30,000.

Vaihingen is an old city, going back as far as the year 799 a.d.. Vaihingen was formally established as a town by Count Gottfried von Vaihingen in the year 1252. After theReformation, Vaihingen became a Protestant city. During the Thirty Years War (1618-1648), Vaihingen became a battle ground between the Protestants and Catholics. The Revolution of 1848 hurt the economy in Vaihingen. Many people left Vaihingen to look for work in other towns. In the early 1900's, a railroad connection was made to Vaihingen. That brought more people, and also businesses, to Vaihingen. In 1938 Vaihingen became the regional center.

New Wave music

New Wave (or New Wave music) is a style of rock music that developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. New wave music was inspired by the punk rock movement.

New Wave music is rock music mixed with other types of music, such as punk rock music, funk, disco, beat and ska. 

New wave bands such as the Talking Heads were anti-corporate, experimental, and had complex lyrics. Other new wave bands included Blondie, Television, Patti Smith, The Jam, The B-52's, Devo, Jungle Street, and Elvis Costello.

In essence, New Wave maintained the rebellious and energetic side of punk rock, yet was less raw and aggressive. Whilst a lot of New Wave was lyrically complex, much New Wave was pop-based, containing simple melodies and catchy hooks. Additionally, New Wave music was also very electronic in nature, and made strong usage of synthesizers. New Wave is a broad term, and as such, New Wave artists varied greatly in style, ranging from pure rock, to synthpop, to reggae-influenced music. New Wave, as a genre, additionally had a strong visual aesthetic, and is noted for the colourful fashions which New Wave artists would sport in the 1980s.

When MTV started broadcasting in 1981, many New Wave bands had their music videos played on television. This made New Wave music more popular. A well-known New Wave video is "Whip It" by Devo.

<doc id="48013" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48013" title="Apple Corps">
Apple Corps

Apple Corps Ltd. is a company started by The Beatles. It grew out of their earlier company, Beatles Ltd., and included NEMS Enterprises, the company started by Beatles manager Brian Epstein.

The Beatles started Apple in 1967, because they wanted to help other musicians, writers, artists and other creative people to succeed. They knew many talents were not discovered, because the business side of their fields were controlled by large corporations. Many corporations cared more about making money than developing new ideas. The Beatles hoped to find and develop the best new talents. Brian Epstein helped to work out the plans for Apple, but died before the company was founded. Epstein's family sold NEMS Enterprises to the Beatles, because they did not wish to keep the company without him.

Apple's first business venture was a retail store, called the Apple Boutique. It was located on Baker Street in London, England. The outside of the building was painted with a strange , and inside clothes and other items were for sale. The mural and clothes were designed by an artistic trio called The Fool. More things were stolen than sold in the boutique, and it was not profitable. Other local businesses did not like the mural outside, and got the city to order it removed. The Beatles decided to close the store, and gave away everything that had been for sale.

Apple bought a at 3 Savile Row in London, and it became Apple's headquarters. The Beatles spent nearly as much time there as they did at Abbey Road Studios. Nearly all the people who worked for them had offices in the building, and they planned to turn the basement into a . "Magic Alex", a Greek-born designer, was in charge of making the recording studio, and also electronics products that Apple could sell, such as an apple-shaped transistor radio.

Apple Corps set up many divisions. Two of these were Apple Films and Apple Records. Apple Films handled the "Magical Mystery Tour", and also music videos (then called "promos") for new Beatles songs. Later Apple Films produced movies like "Born to Boogie" and "Son of Dracula".

Apple Records turned out to be the most successful part of Apple Corps, mostly because of the Beatles's record sales. EMI had a with the band, but they agreed to become for Apple Records. Apple would choose, sign up, and promote recording artists, while EMI would press their records and send them to stores. Hundreds of artists and bands sent in demoes to Apple, hoping to be signed up. As it turned out, most of the artists chosen were handpicked by the Beatles, their friends, or people who worked for them. 

Badfinger, who were Apple's biggest-selling group besides the Beatles, were managed by Mal Evans, who had been the Beatles's . Jackie Lomax was an old friend from Liverpool. Mary Hopkin was referred to Apple by Twiggy, a popular . Billy Preston played keyboards with Little Richard, who toured with the Beatles years earlier. The London chapter of the Radha-Krishna Temple had singers, who recorded an album with George Harrison released on Apple. Other bands and artists were also signed to Apple Records (including Yoko Ono, the wife of John Lennon), but most of their records never became hits.

After Brian Epstein died, the Beatles had not sought a new manager. They believed they could handle their own affairs, working together with just their helpers and their normal business contacts. Over time, this proved to be a bad idea. Small disagreements between the band members turned into major problems at Apple, and agreements could not always be worked out. Many of the people hired to work for Apple caused more problems than they solved, or cost the company money. Magic Alex dreamed and talked big, but could not deliver on the promises he made. Even his recording studio at Apple had to be completely rebuilt, because he had not planned it well or asked for outside help.

The problems between the Beatles led to their breaking up early in 1970. Apple had been part of those problems, and each Beatle lost interest as he saw his hopes for Apple would not work out. Without their input, Apple soon wilted. Its divisions closed one by one. Apple Records's artists went to other labels, or retired from recording. Paul McCartney sued to dissolve the Beatles's business interests. The lawsuit went on for years. The rebuilt Apple Studio was well-liked, and a good place to work on recordings, but closed its doors by 1975. Apple's townhouse headquarters was sold. (A photograph of its front door, covered with graffiti, later appeared on a Ringo Starr album cover.)

In 1975, the Beatles dissolved their partnership, but decided to keep Apple Corps . It became the agency in charge of Beatles-related merchandise, such as , memorabilia, and new releases of old recordings by the band. Apple also owns the rights to most filmed and videotaped of the Beatles, including their public appearances and concerts.

Apple Records reissued many of their non-Beatles recordings on compact disc in the early 1990s, again using EMI as distributors. A television , "The Beatles Anthology", appeared in 1995, produced by Apple. It was a long of the band's history, and included rare concert and video scenes. A companion book was published later.

Apple Corps was most recently in the news, because of a lawsuit between Apple Corps and Apple Computers, an unrelated company. The two companies had trouble in the past, over the use of the Apple name. They made a deal that Apple Computers would not act as a music company. When Apple Computers began to sell their iPod, and set up iTunes, Apple Corps believed they had broken their agreement, and took them to court. Apple Computers won the case, but the two companies later worked out a new deal. This deal now means that the Beatles music is now on the iTunes store, whereas it was not there before

<doc id="48019" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48019" title="Illegal drugs">
Illegal drugs

Illegal drugs are chemicals, pills, liquids, or parts of plants that people take to become intoxicated. The slang word for getting intoxicated is "getting stoned" or "getting high." These drugs are illegal (against the law) in many countries because the governments are worried that if people take these drugs, the people will get sick or hurt themselves, because many drugs are addictive. The word "addictive" means that a person will want to keep taking the drug, even if it is making them sick.

Legal drugs are drugs that a person is allowed to have. If a person has legal drugs, they will not be punished by the police. Legal drugs
include alcohol (for adults), aspirin, glue, cough syrup, and nasal spray.

Illegal drugs are drugs that a person is not allowed to have. If a person is caught with illegal drugs, they will have to go to court, and they may go to jail. 

Illegal drugs include:


Some drugs are very addictive, such as heroin, cocaine, crack, and crystal meth. If a person starts taking heroin, cocaine, crack, or crystal meth, they will probably want to take more. Other drugs are less addictive, such as marijuana and hashish.

Some drugs are in pills,Other drugs are in powders, such as heroin or cocaine. To use drugs that come in powder form, drug users either "snort" the drug into their nose, smoke it in a cigarette, or inject the drug into their body by mixing it with water. Some drugs such as crack and crystal meth come in little crystals, called "rocks." To take drugs that come in crystals, drug users smoke the drug with a pipe. Marijuana and hash are usually smoked in 
chong.

Most illegal drugs cause people to become intoxicated. The slang term for this experience is "getting stoned" or "getting high." When a drug user is intoxicated, they may feel strange, happy, or weird. Some drug users have feelings that they are being silly or dreaming, and they just feel that the rest of the world doesn't matter, all the bad things slip away.

Some drug users feel sad or angry after they take illegal drugs. Other drug users get scared after they take drugs, and begin to worry a lot, a result called "paranoia". Cocaine and crack use sometimes causes users to feel scared or paranoid.

One of the dangers of using illegal drugs is that a person might be caught by the police and charged with a crime. If a judge finds the person guilty, the person might have to go to jail. 

One of the dangers of using drugs such as heroin, crack, or crystal meth is addiction. When a person becomes addicted to a drug, the person wants to keep using the drug, even if they feel sick. When a person is addicted, they have a very powerful urge to get more of the drug. People who are addicted to drugs may steal money from their friends or family to get more drugs. They will also steal gold or silver rings and necklaces that are worth a lot of value or money if the drug user takes them to a gold and silver buyer. Some addicts even do robberies, thefts, or other crimes to get money for drugs. Many women who are addicted to drugs become prostitutes, and have sex for money.

There are many other dangers from using drugs. When a person is intoxicated ("stoned" or "high") from illegal drugs, they might do strange or unsafe things that they would not normally do, such as getting into a fight, having unsafe sex with a person they do not know, or falling down and hurting themselves. Some of the other dangers of drug use come from the drug dealers, who are usually criminal gang members. If a drug user does not pay all the money that they owe to a drug dealer, the drug dealer gang may hurt the person.

One of the major dangers of using illegal drugs come from taking the drugs. When people inject heroin with a needle or share a crack pipe with other drug users they could get an infection or disease such as AIDS or Hepatitis C. Many other diseases can also be transmitted from drug use activites. A drug is any chemical that affects the way the human body works. Alcohol, caffeine, aspirin and nicotine are all drugs. Many drugs can pass from the blood stream into the brain. Once inside the brain, drugs can change the messages that brain cells send to each other, and to the rest of the body.

<doc id="48021" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48021" title="Crack (drug)">
Crack (drug)

Crack (or crack cocaine) is an illegal drug which is made from cocaine. Cocaine is mostly mostly an illegal drug that comes from the leaves of a plant called coca. When people smoke crack, they have a feeling called "being high." 

Crack is made by turning cocaine into little crystals or "rocks." It is illegal to make, sell, and use Crack in most countries. When crack is smoked, it stimulates the nervous system and make a person feel excited, full of energy, and happy, a feeling called "being high." (caused by endorphins) 

Both cocaine and crack are very addictive. This means that if a person starts taking the drug, they will want to keep taking it, and it will be hard to stop. It can cause a heart attack.

If people use crack, they can take too much and get sick or even die. This is called an "overdose" (taking too much). As well, when people take crack, they get intoxicated (like being drunk on alcohol). When a person is intoxicated, they can get hurt while operating a motor vehicle. As well, they may do dangerous things, such as having unsafe sex with a person that they do not know, or getting into a fight with a person and even committing violent acts just to get their next fix.

Crack is a very addictive drug. This means that if a person starts taking the drug, they will want to keep taking it, and it will be hard to stop, even if the drug is making a person sick (ill). When a person is highly addicted to a drug, they will most likely commit criminal acts just to get money for more, such as crimes (for example theft, robbery, fraud, or prostitution).

Crack can also lead to other drugs such as Cocaine or Heroin, leading to even greater dangers. This makes crack a "gateway drug".

Trying to quit Crack is a hard process to go through, the potent in the drug is so strong that the user can become addicted to it the first time they use it. 

Crack does not have a physical withdrawal, only psychological. You will not get sick after stopping but overcoming the urges will be very difficult.

Special effects

Special effects is a term for the things used in movies to create images that do not exist. There are many different types of special effects, for example, making little models or using computer animation.

Action movies often use special effects to create images that would be dangerous or cost a lot of money to create in real life. For example, if an action movie shows a very big battleship blowing up in flames, it would be cost millions of dollars to buy a battleship and blow it up. This would also be dangerous. For this reason, most action movies use special effects if they want to show something blowing up in flames. A movie maker could make a little model of a battleship that is only 20 feet long, and then blow it up, while filming with the motion picture camera. This would be cheaper and safer.

Science fiction movies also often use special effects. Science fiction movies usually tell imaginary stories that take place in the future, on other planets. It would be impossible to actually film a science fiction movie on another planet. For this reason, filmmakers use special effects to create images that look like other planets. For example, if a science fiction movie about a world with three suns was being made, the filmmaker could hire computer experts to create an image of three suns which would appear in the background of the movie scenes. 

Using a computer to create special effects is called "Computer Generated Imagery" or "CGI". Most science fiction movies from the 2000s use a lot of CGI sequences.

Revolutions of 1848 in the German states

The Revolutions in the German states developed in most of the 38 states of Germany that were loosely bound together in the German Confederation after the Congress of Vienna in 1815. To these states belonged Austria as well though Hungary that was part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire was not part of the German Confederation.
These revolutions had as example the French revolution in February 1848, when King Phillipe of France abdicated the throne.

The most successful events of the German revolutions happened in March in Berlin and Vienna, when the fight of the citizens was successful. The result was the election of an German National Assembbly in Frankfurt am Main.

But it was in Berlin too where the Prussian king Frederick William refused to become emporor of a united German state.
Austria and Prussia withdrew their delegates from the Assembly, and the Assembly itself slowly disintegrated afterwards.

YouTube

YouTube is a free video sharing website that lets people upload, view, and share videos. Videos can be rated, and the number of times a video has been watched can also be put on the site. At the moment, Google (a search engine) owns the rights to YouTube. Many different types of videos can be put onto the website. YouTube was made in February 2005 by three former workers of PayPal.

Youtube has been blocked from many schools because of inappropriateness.

On December 3, 2006, government of Iran blocked YouTube and several other sites in an attempt to stop films and music from other countries from being seen.

Turkey blocked YouTube on March 6 2007 for letting videos that were mean to Turks and Atatürk, who is the founder of modern Turkey, to be shown, because of a "virtual war" between Greeks, Armenians, Kurds and Turks on YouTube, with people from each side posting videos to hurt the other. The video that caused banning alleged Turks and Atatürk to be 'gay'. The video was first mentioned on Turkish CNN and the Istanbul public prosecutor sued YouTube for being mean to Turkishness. The court suspended access to YouTube while waiting for the removal of the video. The ban was strongly criticized. YouTube lawyers sent documentary of removal to court and users could access the website again on March 9 2007.

During the week of March 8, YouTube was blocked in Thailand. Many bloggers (people who have a "diary" online) believed the reason YouTube was blocked was because of a video of the former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's speech on CNN. However, the government did not confirm or give reasons for the ban. YouTube was accessible from March 10.

On the night of April 3, YouTube was again blocked in Thailand. The government said it was because of a video on the site that it said was "insulting" to King Bhumibol Adulyadej.. The Ministry of Information and Communication Technology claimed that it would unblock YouTube in a few days, after websites containing references to this video are blocked instead of the entire website. Communications Minister Sitthichai Pookaiyaudom said, "When they decide to withdraw the clip, we will withdraw the ban." Soon after this incident the internet technology blog Mashable was banned from Thailand over the reporting of the YouTube clips in question. 

YouTube is being sued by Brazilian model and MTV VJ Daniela Cicarelli (better known as Ronaldo's ex-fiancée) on the grounds that the site is making available a video footage made by a paparazzo, in which she and her boyfriend are having sex on a Spanish beach. The lawsuit says that YouTube has to be blocked in Brazil until all copies of the video are removed. On Saturday, January 6, 2007, a legal injunction ordered that filters be put in place to prevent users in Brazil from going to the website.

The effectiveness of the measure has been questioned, since the video is not available only on YouTube, but rather has become an Internet phenomenon. On Tuesday, January 9, 2007, the same court overturned their earlier decision, ordering the filters to be taken down, even though the footage was still forbidden, but without technical support for its blockage.

On May 25, 2007 the state-owned company Maroc Telecom blocked all access to YouTube. There were no reasons given why YouTube was blocked. But the guesses are that it might have something to do with some pro-separatist group Polisario clips (Polisario is the Western Sahara independence movement) or because of some videos that criticized King Mohammed VI. This block did not concern the other two private internet-providers, Wana and Meditel. YouTube became accessible again on May 30th, 2007 after "Maroc Telecom" unofficially announced that the denied access to the website was only a "technical glitch".

In Australia, some schools, including all secondary schools in Victoria, have YouTube blocked from student access, after fights have been posted on YouTube.

According the site's terms of service, users may upload videos only if they have the permission of the copyright holder and of the people in the video. Pornography, defamation, harassment, commercials and videos that encourage criminal conduct may not be uploaded. The uploader gives YouTube permission to give out and change the uploaded video for any purpose, and they do not have permission anymore when the uploader deletes the video from the site. Users may view videos on the site but are not allowed to save them on their computers.

Gaul ("Latin:" Gallia) was the name given in ancient times to the area of Western Europe that included northern Italy, France, Belgium, western Switzerland and the parts of the Netherlands and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine river. Many Celtic tribes lived in the region and were known by the Romans simply as "Gauls". 

In English, the word "Gaul" ("French: "Gaulois) may also mean a Celtic inhabitant of that region, although the expression may be used for all ancient speakers of the Gaulish language as well. In this way, "Gaul" and "Celt" are sometimes used in the same sense.

Gauls under Brennus attacked Rome with the Battle of the Allia (390 BC).

Mutton

The terms lamb, mutton or hoggett are used to describe the meat of a domestic sheep. The meat of a sheep a year old or younger is generally known as "lamb", whereas the meat of an older sheep is either "hoggett" or "mutton" depending on its age and characteristics. In some countries all such meat is referred to as "lamb". All of these are known as sheepmeats.

The meat of a lamb is taken from the animal between one month and one year old, with a weight of between 5.5 and 30 kilograms. This meat generally is more tender than that from older sheep and appears more often on tables in some western countries, most often on Easter. 

Hoggett and mutton can taste more flavorful than lamb because they contain a higher concentration of species-characteristic fatty acids; many therefore prefer the stronger flavour of older animals .

Prions (), short for "proteinaceous infectious particles (-ons)", are proteins that can make people sick. Prions cause many forms of encephalitis, or brain disease, such as scrapie, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, kuru, and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, also known as Mad Cow Disease. Prions work by changing the shape of proteins in the living things it causes disease in. While normal proteins have lots of alpha helices, or twisted parts, changed proteins have lots of beta sheets, or flat parts. The word is pronounced "pree-on".

<doc id="48087" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48087" title="Hashish">
Hashish

Hashish is a sticky, thick, dark-colored resin (like sap) which is made from the flower of the female cannabis plant, "Cannabis sativa". The cannabis plant's leaves and flowers contain a chemical or drug known as THC which gives a person who smokes or eats parts of the cannabis plant a feeling of euphoria (makes the user feel good or happy). The name "hashish" comes from an Arabic word meaning "herb". 

The two main drugs made from the cannabis plant are marijuana and hashish. Hashish has much more of the chemical THC (which makes users feel good or happy) than marijuana. Hashish is an illegal drug in the United States, Canada, and many other countries. It is controversial, since some people think it should be legal, some think it should be legal only for medical purposes, and some think it should not be legal at all.

To make hashish, workers rub cannabis blossoms with their hands to get the resin to stick to their hands, and then the resin is collected. Another way to make hashish is to sift the ground-up, dried leaves through a screen and compress the powder resin to make a "brick".

A more modern method of producing hashish is through alcohol extraction. In this method cannabis plants are ground up and covered in isopropyl alcohol or butane and left to sit. The resulting mixture is then evaporated off the alcohol leaving the active terpenoid and terpene compounds which can be used immediately or cooked into bricks. 

When a person wants to use hashish, they usually smoke it by putting a small piece of hashish in a joint with tobacco or marijuana. Then the person lights the paper roll with a flame and inhales the smoke that comes out.

Another way that people use hashish is by putting a small piece of hashish in a pipe or bong then lighting it with a flame, inhaling the smoke. Some people also eat hashish, usually by mixing it into food or baked goods.

The legality of hashish use varies by country. In the USA, there are conflicting state and federal laws concerning the use of the drug. Some states allow medicinal use but these state laws are superseded US federal law which prohibits all use of hash and marijuana. 

Hashish is not legal in the Netherlands, but there are no criminal laws against having a small amount of cannabis (marijuana or hashish). This is because the Netherlands has decided that having cannabis should not be a crime. Some other countries are starting to "decriminalize" marijuana as well (make using it or having it no longer be a crime).

In some countries, such as Canada and America, sick people with serious diseases can legally use marijuana if they have a prescription from a medical doctor. When people with serious diseases such as AIDS or Multiple Sclerosis smoke marijuana, it helps to improve their mood and increase their appetite.

Hashish has much more of the chemical THC (which is a short form for "delta-9-tetra-hydro-cannabinol") than marijuana. THC is the chemical (or drug) which causes people who take hashish or marijuana to feel euphoria (happy). Hashish is a much stronger drug than marijuana. 

When people smoke hashish (in a cigarette, a tin or glass pipe, or other forms of smoking apparatus like a bong) or eat hashish, certain sensations come about. One can start feeling any of the following depending on the strain or origin: happy, relaxed, feeling silly, cloudy (not able to think clearly) which can be descriptive of the type of high experienced. The term of "getting high" could mean that the effects are a more mental stimulation while other types that are for "getting stoned" tend to render the user in a relaxed and observational state. The two types of this "High", are called 1.) a heady high or 2.) couchlock. A heady high does exactly what it sounds like by creating mental stimulation that sometimes leads to exaggerated imagination and potential over analysis on simple subjects. When one "over does it", the stimulation can lead to various degrees of dizziness, euphoria and a sensation of feeling uncoordinated. In a "couchlock" state, one becomes extremely focused on a singular action or topic, sometimes leading to an unproductive state. The latter is achieved depending on the strain of marijuana or hashish, and also depends on the amount of the drug taken.

Since hashish is much stronger than marijuana, people who take a very large amount of hashish may also see imaginary (not really there) colors or patterns, or see strange visions or thoughts which are not actually there (these visions are called hallucinations). Some people who take a large amount of hashish may start feeling scared, strange, or paranoid (worried that something bad is going to happen).

In the 19th century, hashish was used as a source of inspiration by Charles Baudelaire's Club des Hachichins. This was a group of French writers.

Hashish is less dangerous than many other illegal drugs that are commonly used. Unlike other drugs like cigarettes and alcohol, it is impossible for a person to die from an overdose of hashish. But a person who had a very large amount of hashish could start feeling sick, or feeling strange.

One of the dangers of using hashish is that a person is often less capable than when sober. This increases the risk of normal accidents slightly, but more importantly it changes the way you receive and process an emergency situation, which could be dangerous in activities like driving a car or motorcycle.

Smoking any drugs such as marijuana, hashish, or tobacco is bad for the lungs. Smoke hurts the lungs and the throat because the smoke has tar in it and contains chemicals that can cause cancer in the lungs or mouth if the person smokes over a long time period. A person who only eats hashish will not hurt their lungs or throat, but may take too much without noticing in time to avoid side-effects. A relatively newer process of inhalation which is much safer than smoking is vaporizing the Hashish. This method is based on increasing the temperature of the Hashish to about 190-195 degrees Celsius which is about the temperature THC vaporizes at but is far below the point when "carbons" begin being burned. The end result is the THC compound being breathed in combined with air rather than the THC compound being breathed in with smoke.

Addiction is not based on a substance but a persons ability to become addicted to a feeling—Feeling like you cannot stop taking hashish.
Most other illegal drugs, such as heroin, crack, and cocaine are very addictive. This means that if a person starts taking heroin, meth, or cocaine, the person will want to keep taking more of the drug, even if it is making them sick (ill). Legal drugs such as tobacco and alcohol are also found to be addictive. tobacco has additives that make it more harmful than cannabis and hash.

Hashish and marijuana are not addictive like heroin, cocaine and cigarettes. Most people are able to use hashish as a recreational (for fun) drug, and stop taking it when they want to. However, some people who use hashish over several months or several years do get a type of addiction called a psychological ("in your mind") addiction. This means that the person is addicted to the high.

Hashish is often just called "hash". Slang terms vary from one country to country. A pipe used for smoking hashish is often called a "bowl". A water pipe for smoking hashish is called a "bong". There are also many slang terms for hashish smoking, such as "getting faded", "blown" or "blazing". Many slang terms for cannabis intoxication, such as "getting high", "getting stoned", "getting ripped", "toking bowls" and "spliffing" are shared for hashish as the effects of cannabis / marijuana and hashish are the same.

Jean-Paul Sartre

Jean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre (June 21, 1905 – April 15, 1980) was a French existentialist (way of thinking about human freedom) philosopher (person who thinks about ideas and ways of thinking).

Sartre also wrote plays, stories for movies, novels (stories), and criticism (written comments about other books or plays).

Sartre was born in Paris, France. He went to school in Paris at a school called the École Normale Supérieure. In 1929, Sartre graduated from university with a doctorate in philosophy. Sartre served in the French Army from 1929 to 1931.

Simone de Beauvoir was a woman who was Sartre's close friend and partner (like a wife, except that they were not married). Simone de Beauvoir was also interested in thinking about ideas and ways of thinking. Simone de Beauvoir was also a philosopher and writer. Sartre and Beauvoir criticized the ways of thinking of people from their country.

In 1938, Sartre wrote the novel (story) called "La Nausée" (Nausea). This story explains the way of thinking of existentialism. Existentialism is a way of thinking about human freedom.

In 1939 Sartre was drafted into the French army. France was at war with Germany, because Germany had invaded France (this war was called World War II)؟ Sartre was captured by German Nazi troops in 1940, and Sartre spent nine months as a prisoner of war in a camp. Sartre was released from the prison camp (jail) in 1941. Then Sartre began working as a teacher again. He made friends with other writers and thinkers such as Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Toussaint and Dominique Desanti, and Jean Kanapa.

In 1943, Sartre wrote a book about philosophy (ways of thinking) called "L'Être et le Néant", which means "Being and Nothingness". In this book, Sartre said that when people tried too hard to conform to the rules of society (or of their country), then people did not really make their own decisions.

In 1945, Sartre started a newspaper called "Les Temps Modernes" (Modern Times), which had articles about politics, art and literature. He also began writing a group of novels (stories) called "Les Chemins de la Liberté" (The Roads to Freedom).

In 1946 Sartre wrote a book about philosophy (ways of thinking) called "Existentialism is a Humanism", which explains the way of thinking of existentialism. Existentialism is a way of thinking about human freedom.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Sartre became involved in politics. Sartre said that France should leave Algeria, a country where France had many soldiers. In the 1960s, Sartre said that the Vietnam War was bad. In 1960, he wrote the "Critique de la raison dialectique" (Critique of Dialectical Reason). In the 1960s, Sartre had many arguments with Louis Althusser, a man who believed in communism.

Sartre died in 1980. His body is buried in Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris. His funeral was attended by 50,000 people.

John Steinbeck

John Ernst Steinbeck (February 27, 1902 - December 20, 1968) is a very famous American writer of the 20th century. Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962. Some of his most famous works are "Of Mice and Men" (1937) and "The Grapes of Wrath" (1940), which won a Pulitzer Prize. In these two books, Steinbeck writes about migrant workers during the Great Depression.

Steinbeck used naturalism in his books. His characters and stories came from real events from the early 20th century. His work shows his wide range of interests, such as politics, history, philosophy and mythology.

Seventeen of his works were made into Hollywood films. Steinbeck also tried screen writing, which is writing for films. He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing in Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 film, "Lifeboat".

Steinbeck was born to John Ernst Steinbeck Sr., a first-generation German American. He attended Stanford University until 1925 when he left the university in order to become a writer. His first work, "Cup of Gold", came out four years later, but was not successful. He married Carol Henning the following year.

Steinbeck first gained success with the novel "Tortilla Flat" in 1935. The story was about two men living in Monterey, California during the Great Depression. The book won the California Commonwealth Club's Gold Medal. It was made into a movie seven years later, starring Spencer Tracy, Hedy Lamarr, and John Garfield.

Steinbeck continued to write on the subject of the Great Depression. Two years later, Steinbeck wrote "Of Mice and Men", considered as one of the best works of American literature in the twentieth century. His story dealt with the lives of two migrant laborers with big dreams in California. It was turned into a Hollywood film in 1939, starring Lon Chaney Jr. as "Lennie" and Burgess Meredith as "George". That year, Steinbeck followed up with another book, "The Grapes of Wrath". The book is about the Joad family and their travels from Oklahoma to California during the Dust Bowl in search of work. The novel won the Pulitzer Prize and film adaptation won two Academy Awards, and is ranked #7 on the American Film Institute's list, "100 Years...100 Cheers: America's Most Inspiring Movies". There was controversy with the book, though. Many people felt that Steinbeck's liberal opinions misrepresented the truth of Dust Bowl migrations.
He had this student that his name was Oscar Perez and they would both do the job together.

Steinbeck continued to write from 1940s to 1960s. He wrote such works as "The Moon is Down", "The Pearl", "Cannery Row", "East of Eden" and "The Winter of Our Discontent". In 1962, Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize in Literature for "his realistic and imaginative writing, combining as it does sympathetic humor and keen social perception."

Two years later, he was awarded the "United States Medal of Freedom" by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Steinbeck died on December 20, 1968 in New York at the age of 66, of a heart attack.

Bremerhaven Hauptbahnhof

Bremerhaven Hauptbahnhof is the central railway station in Bremerhaven, Germany.

The station lies on the line from Bremen to Cuxhaven. The line from Bremen was built in 1862, and a station for that was built in Geestemünde. At the time, Geestemünde did not belong to Bremerhaven, but was a separate town. The line from Geestemünde to Cuxhaven was then built in 1896. 

Because there were too many trains in the old station and it is connected only with single-track, it was decided to knock down the old station. The new station, which is now Bremerhaven Hauptbahnhof, is opened in 1914. Because it still was in Geestemünde, but not as far away as the old station, it was called Geestemünde-Bremerhaven. 
In 1924, some other towns joined Bremerhaven, and the city got a new name, Wesermünde. The station got a new name, Wesermünde-Bremerhaven, because of that.

In 1944, in the middle of World War II, the hall over the railway tracks was destroyed by a bomb that was thrown from an American plane. The hall was not built again after the war.

Wesermünde received another name and was called Bremerhaven from 1947, and the station received the new name too and was now called Bremerhaven Hauptbahnhof. That means "Bremerhaven Central Station", and it was called that way because it was now in the middle of the new, large city.
Electric cables were put in the station in 1966, so that electric trains could run. Trains that were carrying soldiers of the US Army often ran to Bremerhaven in the 1970s, because the US Army had large barracks in the city.

Duchy

A duchy is a territory or domain ruled by a duke or duchess. Historically, some duchies in Continental Europe were sovereign, while others (especially in France and Britain) were subordinate districts of a kingdom. 

Traditionally, a "grand duchy", such as Luxembourg, was generally independent and sovereign. Sovereign duchies were common in the Holy Roman Empire and German-speaking areas. In France, a number of duchies existed in the medieval period. Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom still holds the medieval French title of "Duke of Normandy"; the only lands still attached to the Duchy of Normandy are the Channel Islands. 

In medieval England, the territories of Lancashire and Cornwall were made duchies, with certain powers given to their Dukes.

Anglo-Norman language

The Anglo-Norman language is the name given to the special sort of the Norman language spoken by the Anglo-Normans, the descendants of the Normans who ruled the Kingdom of England following the conquest by William of Normandy in 1066. This langue d'oïl became the official language of England and later developed into the unique insular dialect now known as the Anglo-Norman language.

Anglo-Norman was the spoken language of the Norman nobility and was also used in the courts.

Langue d'oïl

Langues d'oïl (which literally means in English: "languages of yes") is the linguistic and historical name for the Gallo-Romance languages which developed from Latin in the northern territories of Roman Gaul that now are occupied by northern France, part of Belgium and the Channel Islands.


"Langue d'oïl" (in the singular), "Oïl dialects" and "Oïl languages" (in the plural) refer to all the ancient northern Gallo-Romance languages as well as their modern-day descendants. The most widely spoken modern Oïl language is French, and others include Norman, Walloon, Picard, Gallo, Poitevin-Saintongeais, Champenois.

They share many common linguistic features. One of these is that "Oïl" (pronounced [wil], or [wi] as in modern French "oui"), was the ancestor of the word for "yes" used in all the Oïl languages ("oc" was and still is the word used in territories to the south, and that is why the Occitan language is also called "langue d'oc" (literal English translation: "language of yes")).

Ring

A ring is a piece of jewelry that is usually worn on the finger. It is often made of metal such as gold, silver, platinum, but can be made of other things, for example, bone or glass. Many rings have gemstones on them, for beauty and decoration on your finger.

Rings have been used for engagements and weddings since prehistoric times.

The engagement ring is meant to be a sign of luck and happiness. Both men and women used to wear an engagement ring to show that they were going to be married, but in more recent times only women have normally worn them. A diamond ring is seen as being especially lucky, as the sparkle of the diamond is said to come from the fires of love. A pearl in a ring is unlucky, as the pearl is a sign of tears.

Because the ring is round and does not have an end, it is seen as a symbol of love which never ends. It is thought to be unlucky to take off your wedding ring from the finger unless it is absolutely necessary.

Investment

Investment or investing means that an asset is bought, or that money is put into a bank to get a future interest from it. 

Literally, the word means the "action of putting something in to somewhere else" (perhaps originally related to a person's garment or 'vestment').

The major difference in the use of the term investment between the economics field and the finance field is that economists refer to a real investment (such as a machine or a house), while financial economists refer to a financial asset, such as money that is put into a bank or the market, which may then be used to buy a real asset. An important thing to know about investing is that even when the times are tough that is the time when you most need to hold on to your investment.

The investment decision (also known as "capital budgeting") is one of the fundamental decisions of business management.

Wars of the Roses

The Wars of the Roses (1455 - 1487) was a series of civil wars fought over the throne of England between supporters of the House of Lancaster and supporters of the House of York. Both houses were branches of the Plantagenet royal house, tracing their descent from King Edward III.

The main reason for the war was that King Edward III had many sons, as shown in the family tree below. His oldest son, who is known by the nickname, "The Black Prince", died first, and the throne passed to the Black Prince's son, Richard, who became King Richard II of England in 1377 at the age of only ten. He grew up to be a weak and unpopular king, and one of his actions was to send his cousin Henry into exile. Henry later returned, while Richard was away in Ireland, and took over the country. When Richard returned, Henry tricked him into giving himself up. Richard was put in prison, where he died, and Henry became King Henry IV of England. 

Although Henry IV reigned until his death, and was followed by his son, King Henry V, the next king in line, King Henry VI was only a baby. While he was still growing up, the most powerful men in the kingdom started quarrelling over how to run the country, and some of them raised an army to try to take the throne. Henry VI and his family fought back, and the war between his supporters and their enemies lasted for many years, finally coming to an end when King Henry VII of England came to the throne in 1487.

Friedrich Kellner Diary

The Diary of Friedrich Keller is a journal written during the Second World War. The author, August Friedrich Kellner, was a justice inspector in the courthouse in Mainz. He was also a political activist for the Social Democratic Party of Germany between 1918 and 1933. After Hitler banned the party, the family moved to Laubach. 

When Hitler ordered the invasion of Poland in September 1939, Kellner began . He named his diary "Mein Widerstand," which means "My Opposition." In the diary, he wrote down what he saw and heard about what happened in Nazi Germany. He wrote it so that people later would know about it. 

The diary has ten volumes, with a total of 861 pages. There are 676 dated entries. Included in the diary are more than 500 newspaper clippings.

At the end of World War Two, most Germans said they knew nothing about the mass murders of the Jews. But as early as October 28, 1941, Kellner wrote the following entry in his diary:

There is not much in the diary about the Kellners’ personal lives. Instead, Friedrich Kellner wrote about the political atmosphere of a country run by terrorists. He also wrote about the leaders and people in other nations who remained indifferent to what Hitler and Mussolini were planning. Kellner was very angry that millions of people had to die because a few politicians in the democracies failed to confront Hitler and his allies. Kellner was also angry at the famous aviator Charles Lindbergh, and the car manufacturer Henry Ford, and at others who blindly expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler. “The whole world let themselves be fooled by this man,” Kellner wrote on May 3, 1942. 
Friedrich Kellner expected America and England to come to the rescue. On June 25, 1941, he wrote:

Friedrich Keller wrote the diary to expose the crimes of the Third Reich. He believed his diary could serve as a warning for future generations to oppose dictatorships and their totalitarian ideology.
After the war, Friedrich Kellner helped to reestablish the Social Democratic Party. He became chairman of the Laubach branch. He retired from politics in 1960, at the age of seventy-five.
In 1968, he gave his diary to his American grandson, Professor Robert Scott Kellner, to take to America for safekeeping. He told him:

<doc id="48172" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48172" title="Ninja">
Ninja

A Ninja is a kind of spy or assassin who lived in Japan beginning in the 14th century. 

Ninja (or shinobi) were a mystery in Japanese history. The correct Japanese word for these warriors was shinobi-no-mono. Ninja is easier to say, this is why it is more widely used. Ninja warriors created secret associations and participated in many political killings. Their mystery comes from the two ideas: 1) they always participated in secret spy operations and political killings; 2) ninja were hired by heads of army as paid warriors (mercenaries). The art of fighting which was used by ninja was called ninjitsu, which was a combination of shinobi-no-jitsu and shinobi-jitsu.

A ninja was always considered a superman, who was able to fly and who possessed extra natural skills. Ninja existed during the entire history of Japan, but ninja only became specially trained people at the beginning of 15th century. They mainly trained in the region of Iga and Koga. 

Ninja were involved in samurai wars and were hired by samurai for different missions. But at the same time samurai did not accepted them as noble warriors, because most of the ninja came from lower social levels. They were dangerous and could not be controlled. Their methods of fighting did not fit the samurai code. The samurai code is a code of honor. For example, the samurai warrior would show his rank and would only fight a samurai of equal or higher rank. Japanese land lords (daimyo) widely used the services of the Iga and Koga ninja in the period of 1485-1581. But in 1581, one of the three daimyo who united Japan – Oda Nobunaga attacked ninja from Iga province. The ninja remained alive and ran to the provinces Kii and Mikawa, where Tokugawa Ieyasu protected them. Later, Oda Nobunaga was killed by a samurai named Akechi Mitsuhide, who later became an enemy to Tokugawa Ieyasu.

The art of ninja fighting was transmitted from father to son, or from master (sensei) to best students. But in the middle of 17th century, Nakagawa Sosuntzin created a ninja school in the Mutsu Province. It was called Nakagawa-ryu and taught ninjitsu method of fighting. Nakagawa Sosuntzin himself trained a group of 10 men, which he called Hayamiti-no-mono (men of the short hit). Ninja were taught many more things than a samurai. He had to be skilled at handling swords, spears, bows and many more; but also he had to know about explosive and poisonous substances, to be a good path finder and to survive in different situations. Usually they were trained from young age and should have maintained their physical shape. A ninja who could read and write was very appreciated. 

A ninja usually wore black clothes which helped him to hide in the dark. If they had to fight on the battlefield, they put on a light armor, which protected him but also permitted to move easily. On the feet they worn Japanese socks which separated the big toe (the socks were called tabi). 

The diversity of ninja weapons and attributes is much wider than that of the samurai. The main weapon of ninja was the sword. Ninja sword was usually shorter than samurai katana and had a straight blade. When they climbed, the sword was put on the left shoulder, thus the handle of the sword was close to the left ear. Ninja also used different types of throwing knives, and a weapon for fist called tagaki. They used metallic claws on their feet which served them for climbing and for feet hits.

They are also very close to the other form of Japanese killer, a samurai.

In a modern democracy, a senate is a group of people who are part of a legislature. A legislature passes or changes laws for their country, state, or other area. Members of a senate are called senators. Some legislatures have two groups of people (working in separate places) called "houses". A senate can be called a "House of Senators". The other house of such legislatures is called a "House of Representatives" or House of Commons. In such legislatures, both houses must pass the same bill to make it a law. Examples of modern democratic areas having legislatures with senates are the United States of America (U. S.), Canada, Australia and many states in the U. S. The senators are elected by citizens in areas the senators represent. 

The first ever senate was the Roman Senate. 

Senate is also the name of the ruling body of some universities.

It has long been the economic centre of northern Nigeria, and a centre for the sale of groundnuts. Kano is known for the Bayero University and a railway station with trains to Lagos, moving through Kaduna, while Kano International Airport can be found nearby. Kano has long been a centre for Nigeria's Islamic culture; one of the country's finest mosques lies in the city.

It is also the site where the Kano river project was developed. This is a large irrigation scheme.

The city of Kano was founded around A.D. 1000 as an Hausa city of its own. Kano remained a big emirate, or Muslim kingdom, until the making of the country, Nigeria, in 1903. Kano became known for its trade in gold, leather, ivory, salt and slaves within the area. This perhaps is the reason for the city's wealth and power in the 14th century, when Islam gained a growing following. By the 15th century, the first Central Mosque had been built in the city.

Escherichia coli or E. coli is a bacterium that can be found in human intestines. Scientists have studied "E. coli" very well, and know more about how "E. coli" cells work than any other organism. E. coli is not always harmful. In fact, the only known harmful strand is O157.

"E. coli" normally grow in soil and in the large intestines of many mammals, including humans. Most strains of "E. coli" do not cause disease, but instead help animals get vitamins and digest food. Some strains of "E. coli" cause sickness in people.

"E. coli" are not usually in food or water. When food has not been prepared with clean equipment, "E. coli" can grow in the food. When "E. coli" are found in water, this may mean that the water has touched sewage. 

It is named after Theodor Escherich, who discovered it, in 1885. It was officially named after him in 1919.

The best treatment for E. coli is plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.

Hemoglobin (also spelled haemoglobin) is a protein in the blood which contains Iron and is used to transport oxygen around the body. Hemoglobin are found in the red blood cells. Because hemoglobin are red, red blood cells are red. Hemoglobin are very small, and several million can fit in each red blood cell. There are millions of hemoglobins in each red blood cell and millions of red blood cells in the human body. 

When hemoglobin has oxygen in it, its called oxyhemoglobin. 

Hemoglobin is made from three parts: a heme molecule, a globin chain, and an iron atom. Heme is an organic molecule. This means it contains Carbon. Each hemoglobin molecule has four globin chains, four heme molecules, and four Iron atoms. Globin is a protein that is in the body. Each globin chain surrounds a heme. The Iron atom goes in the middle of the heme molecule. When hemoglobin is in the lungs, it picks up oxygen in its heme, and carries it to the rest of the body.

Sergei Prokofiev

Sergei Sergeyevich Prokofiev () (b. Sontsovka, Ukraine 23 April 1891; d. Moscow 5 March 1953) was a Russian composer and pianist who came from Ukraine. During his lifetime, Ukraine was part of Russia. Together with Dmitri Shostakovich he is one of the greatest Russian composers of the 20th century. Children all over the world love to listen to his musical story "Peter and the Wolf" and the music for "Lieutenant Kije", but he wrote many other great works including symphonies, concertos, piano sonatas, ballets and operas.

Prokofiev was born into an educated family whose mother recognized very early her son's musical gifts. His father was a college-educated agronomist who managed the farm-site of his employer in the Ukrainian steppe. His mother played the piano reasonably well in her son's opinion. The young Sergei started composing at a very early age. By the time he was eleven he had written two operas and a series of small piano pieces he would later call "little puppies". Soon he was writing music with unusual time signatures and in unusual changes of key.

Prokofiev's formal musical education began when, as a young boy, he started taking lessons from Reinhold Glière. In 1904 he went to study at the Conservatory in St Petersburg. He was a brilliant student, but he often disagreed with the way the professors were teaching. He was bored with the lessons in orchestration from Rimsky-Korsakov and the counterpoint lessons from Liadov although he could have learned more from these great men. His main friends were the composers Nikolai Myaskovsky and Boris Asafiev. He often showed them his latest piano compositions which sounded very modern. Many of St. Petersburg's newspaper critics did not like his music, while others felt he showed great promise and was sure to be a "futurist".

Prokofiev spent the summer of 1909 back at home in the small Russian farming village of Sontsovka in what is now Ukraine where his father was an estate manager. He worked in a way that was to be typical of him all his life: he carefully kept a diary until the middle 1930s, was an excellent chess player and writer, kept making changes to a number of his earlier works. He often borrowed music from one composition and put it in another, or used unfinished works in new compositions.

When he returned to St Petersburg he took piano lessons from a teacher at the St. Petersburg Conservatory called Anna Esipova. She worked hard to discipline him in his playing although he did not appreciate her efforts. He also took conducting lessons from Nikolai Tcherepnin who taught him to like late-Romantic composers such as Scriabin and Debussy. He wrote some music himself in this style, but most of the music he wrote at this time sounded very harsh and dissonant and, although he was becoming quite famous, many people hated it. When he finished his studies at the Conservatoire he won its top prize (the Rubinstein Prize) with his "First Piano Concerto", although the examiners had found it hard to agree and Rimsky-Korsakov said that Prokofiev was "gifted but immature".

Prokofiev travelled to London where he met many famous people including Diaghilev who had a very skilled ballet group called Ballets Russes. The composer Igor Stravinsky had been writing ballet music for Diaghilev’s dancers. Prokofiev particularly loved Stravinsky’s "Rite of Spring" and it influenced his music. He wrote an opera "The Gambler" based on the novel by Brusilov but the singers and the orchestra did not understand his music and refused to perform it. One of the first works of Prokofiev to become known all over the world was his First Symphony known as the "Classical Symphony". He made the music sound like that of composers from the Classical period such as Haydn. This symphony is still very popular today.

In 1917 the Russian Revolution took place. The country was in a chaotic state so Prokofiev went to the United States. After a journey which took four months via the Transsiberian railway, Tokyo and San Francisco, he arrived in New York. His first real success came from his connections with Cyrus McCormik in Chicago. His first major commission was the opera "The Love for Three Oranges" for the Chicago Lyric Opera. It was popular in Chicago but not in New York City where he really wanted to make his reputation. He soon traveled to Paris to see Diagalev again whom he had met earlier in London. His first ballet for him was "Ala and Lolly" which Diagalev did not like and would not perform. This ballet later became Prokofiev's "Scythian Suite". His next ballet was more successful, "The Tale of the Buffoon". He also wrote his "Third Piano Concerto" which is his most popular concerto for piano. Prokofiev lived off and on in Paris for fourteen years, but he often went on tour, performing his works on the piano. In 1928 his "Third Symphony" was first performed, much of which was based on music from his opera " The Fiery Angel" which was never performed completely in his lifetime. In the late-1920s he was invited back to Russia. Although many Soviet people tried to persuade him to stay there he decided to remain in the West where he was starting to have a very successful career. It was not until 1936 that he finally decided to move back to Russia. Life was not easy in the Soviet Union for all types of creative people such as musicians, poets, writers and film makers. Composers were expected to write music which would make ordinary people happy and make them feel proud of their country and of the communist revolution. Any music that did not do this was called “decadent” or “formalist”. Many artists where punished for creating works that did not do what the socialist politicians expected of them. Prokofiev had never been interested in politics, and he thought the politicians would leave him in peace so that he could write the kind of music he liked.

Back in Russia Prokofiev settled in Moscow. He wrote several children’s pieces including "Peter and the Wolf". He was asked to write music for two important jubilees: the 20th anniversary of the Revolution and the centenary of Pushkin’s death. He took great care over this music. Much of what he wrote was to be directed by Meyerhold, but Meyerhold was arrested, later tortured and murdered so the whole project never happened. Some of the music written for the Pushkin centenary was later used in his opera "War and Peace", the "Stone Flower" ballet and Symphonic Waltzes. He also wrote a very large piece called "Cantata for the Twentieth Anniversary of the October Revolution", using words by Marx, Lenin and Stalin for a total of 500 performers. The music included realistic effects such as gun shots, machine-gun fire and sirens. However, many critics said that the music was vulgar, and it was not performed until 1966, long after Prokofiev’s death. He tried to make the soviet authorities pleased by writing a "safe" opera called "I am the Son of the Working People" but the politicians stopped it during its early auditions. The opera was going to be produced by Meyerhold, but again it never happened because Meyerhold was arrested and executed.

The World War II was a time of change for Prokofiev for several reasons. In 1941 his marriage to Lina Llubera came to an end and his new companion Mira Mendelsohn, and later wife, saw him through his last years. Lina was a foreigner and marriage to foreigners was made illegal (forbidden) at that time. In 1948 she was arrested, charged with being a spy, and sent to a labour camp. On the other hand, Mira had lived her entire life within the Soviet system and was much more aware of how to survive in the politacally-charged times. In 1945, shortly after the premier of his Fifth Symphony, he had a stroke which was the beginning of a period of bad health. He spent a lot of time away from Moscow where it was unsafe. The first signs that his health was to be poor occurred in Alma-Ata in 1943 when he had a fainting spell. He was an workaholic and this, plus the pressures placed upon him by the Soviet system, forced him to withdraw from an active social life in Moscow. Prokofiev lived with Mira for the rest of his life. Lina was freed from the labour camp after Stalin’s death. Later she left the Soviet Union and she died in London in 1989.

During the war Prokofiev composed a lot of his best music. He wrote his last piano sonatas as well as working on his operas "Betrothal in a Monestary" after Sherican, and "War and Peace" (based on the novel by Tolstoy) and writing his film music for both Eisenstein’s "Alexander Nevsky" and "Ivan the Terrible" and composing his Fifth Symphony. The first performance of this symphony, given on 13 January 1945, was the last time he conducted in public. He spent the rest of his life in a house in the country to the west of Moscow, although during his last winters he lived in Moscow close to his doctors. Even in these last years he was not to find peace. Stalin’s rule of terror had serious effects on all Soviet artists. In 1948 a committee of the Communist Party spoke out against several Soviet composers including Prokofiev. They said that his music was “formalist” and “alien” to the Soviet people. His opera “War and Peace” was not allowed to be performed because it was neither lyrical nor patriotic enough. The works he wrote in his last years were mostly ones which the politicians officially approved. His last great work of this period is the "Symphony-Concerto" for cello and orchestra which used a lot of music from the unsuccessful "Cello Sonata", and greatly revised with the help of the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich.

Prokofiev died of a brain haemorrhage on 5 March 1953. His death was hardly mentioned in the newspapers because the dictator Stalin died on the same day.

Arab Christians

Arab Christians are people who speak Arabic and have the religion of Christianity.

Most Christian Arabs live in the Middle East, where Islam is the biggest religion. The largest number of Arab Christians are in Egypt (around 8 millions). In Arab populations of these places (the Americas, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and America), a big number of these Arabs are Christians. In Brazil, there are more than 12 million Arabs, and most of these people are Christian.
For hundreds of years, Arab Christians have lived peacefully with Muslims and Jews. Even after the spreading of Islam from the 7th century AD onwards, many Christians chose not to change their religion to Islam. Instead, they kept Christianity as their belief. As Muslims call them the "People of the Book" (with Jews), Christians in the area are to obey Islamic laws. This is called the "Shari'ah" law.

Arab Christians have been around before Arab Muslims. This is because there were many Arab tribes that became Christians since the first century. They were the Nabateans (whose ancestors were Aramean) and the Ghassanids (who were of Qahtani origin and spoke Yemeni-Arabic and Greek). They protected the south-eastern parts of the Byzantine Empire in north Arabia. 

Arab Christians made important contributions to the Arab world, and they still do. Some of the best poem writers at certain times were Arab Christians, and many Arab Christians were doctors, writers, government staffs, and people who knew a lot about literature.

<doc id="48243" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48243" title="Synthesizer">
Synthesizer

A musical synthesizer is an instrument that uses electricity to make musical sounds. Very often synthesizers have a keyboard like that of a piano. When playing a piano keyboard, sounds are made by hitting soft hammers against strings pulled very tight. When playing a synthesizer keyboard, sounds are made by turning electrical oscillators on and off. Since "synthesizer" is such a big word, the word is usually shortened to "synth".

An oscillator is something that "vibrates", or repeats the same pattern. The pendulum of a clock, for example, is a very slow oscillator. A piano string "oscillates" when struck by a hammer.

Electric oscillators might be made using transistors. They turn electricity into electrical patterns, or signals, that repeat over and over. When different keys are pressed , different notes are heard. This is done by making the signal from the oscillator repeat at different rates. 

The signal can be boosted in strength and sent straight to a loudspeaker. But the sound of a simple signal can be boring after a while. Sounds can be made more interesting in many ways!


By combining many of these methods, synths can now sound very much like older instruments. For one example, special synths called "drum synths" are used just to make the sounds a drummer might make. Synths can also make many new sounds never heard before.

In the early 2000s, computers got fast enough so "software synths" could be made. These are computer programs designed to look and work like a synth. They tend to be less expensive, so more can be used. Most of these programs can be downloaded for free, however this may be illegal, which means that the police officers may arrest the player and send that person to jail.

There are special tools available to play synths. For example, a thing called a "wind controller" lets players of wind instruments use their special skills. But there is still a need for more ways to control synths to make them more expressive.

John Foxe

John Foxe (1516–April 8, 1587) is remembered as the author of "Foxe's Book of Martyrs".

Foxe was born at Boston, in Lincolnshire, England of a prominent family. In 1535 Foxe was admitted to Magdalen College School. He became a fellow July 1539. 
Foxe resigned from his college in 1545, after referring to it as "a prison." During his time at Oxford he became an evangelical, meaning that he decided for Protestant beliefs not accepted by the Church of England under Henry VIII. 
As he wanted to leave Oxford, Foxe looked to other evangelicals for help but received only advice and a little money. Foxe married Agnes Randall on February 3, 1547. 

With the death of Henry VIII in January of 1547 Foxe's prospects (and those of the evangelical cause generally) changed for the better. Foxe was ordained deacon by Nicholas Ridley on June 24, 1550.

In the fall of 1554 Foxe moved to Frankfurt, where he lived with Anthony Gilby in the English colony of Protestant refugees. 
Foxe then removed to Basel where he lived and worked with John Bale and Lawrence Humphrey.

In 1559, when Mary I had died Foxe returned to England. He lived for some time at Aldgate, London, in the house of his former pupil, Thomas Howard. Foxe started publishing works of religious controversy and worked on a new martyrology, which would become the "Foxe's Book of Martyrs". 
Foxe was ordained priest by Edmund Grindal, now Bishop of London, on January 25, 1560, and he moved to Norwich to live with its bishop, John Parkhurst. On March 23 of the following year the first edition of Foxe's Book of Martyrs was published.

Foxe was one of the earliest students of Anglo-Saxon, and he and Day published an edition of the "Saxon gospels" with the help of Archbishop Parker.
Foxe died on the 8th of April 1587 and was buried at St. Giles's, Cripplegate.

<doc id="48246" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48246" title="Evangelicalism">
Evangelicalism

The word evangelicalism mostly means religious practices and traditions which are found in conservative Protestant Christianity. 

Evangelicalism is typified by an emphasis on evangelism, a personal experience of conversion, biblically oriented faith and a belief in the importance of Christian faith to cultural issues. In the late 20th century and early 21st century, Protestant people, churches and social movements have often been called "evangelical" in contrast to Protestant liberalism. 

In continental Europe the word Evangelical is often understood to mean Protestant or even Lutheran as a literal translation of the German "evangelisch". In Germany, the Protestant religious group known as Lutherans in the USA and other places throughout the world are exclusively referred to as "die Evangelischen" or the Evangelicals belonging to the Evangelical Church in Germany.

Millipede

Millipedes are arthropods. They have very long bodies. Millipedes are segmented. They have between 20 to over 100 segments. Except for the first few segments, each segment has 2 pairs of legs. So far, about 10.000 different species of millipedes have been identified. The animals are detrivores, they eat what is left over. In most of the cases, this is decaying leaves and other plant matter. Most millipedes are poisonous. This protects them from being eaten. They are usually slow movers. 
They can easily be told apart from centipedes. Centipedes move faster, and only have one pair of legs per segment. 
Millipedes were among the first animals to colonize the land.

Edward V of England

Edward V (4 November 1470–1483) was the King of England from 9 April 1483 until he was removed two months later, on 25 June 1483. 

Edward was born at Westminster while his father, King Edward IV of England, was in exile in Burgundy. The King, Henry VI, said his mother and his sisters would be safe if they stayed at the abbey. When Edward IV came back and took over the throne again, Edward became his heir and was given the title "Prince of Wales". Edward IV thought it would be right for the Prince of Wales to rule Wales, so he sent little Prince Edward to live in Ludlow Castle, where the Council of Wales met. The prince was helped by his uncle, Anthony Woodville, Earl Rivers, and began to learn how to be a ruler. His mother, Queen Elizabeth, was often with him, and his father, the king, also visited.

The prince spent most of his time at Ludlow until he was twelve, when his father the king suddenly died. The prince had to go straight to London to take the throne, and his uncle, Earl Rivers, went with him. On the way, they were met by another of his uncles, Richard, Duke of Gloucester. The Duke was a younger brother of King Edward IV, and the king had given him the title of "Lord Protector" in the hope that he would look after Prince Edward until he was old enough to be the real king.

Instead of arranging a coronation for the new king, Duke Richard decided to take the throne for himself, and became King Richard III. He sent Prince Edward to live in the Tower of London and wait for his coronation. He also got Edward's younger brother, Prince Richard, Duke of York, to come and live at the Tower. Earl Rivers was executed by Richard. Gloucester was able to convince people that the two young princes were not the legal heirs to the throne. On 25 June 1483, the Parliament said that Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was the legal king. 

After a few months, the two boys disappeared, and what happened to them is still a mystery today. Most people think that the two boys were murdered. They became known as the Princes in the Tower. It is most likely they were killed by their uncle, Richard III. It is also possible that they were killed by Henry VII, who became king two years later.

In 1674, during building work at the Tower, a wooden chest was found under a staircase in the White Tower. It contained the bones of two young boys. It has never been proved that these are the missing princes, but King Charles II had the bones buried in Westminster Abbey. In 1933 the bones were looked at again by scientists who believed that they were the two princes.

It takes its name from the heavily populated City of Leicester, its traditional administrative centre, although the City of Leicester is today administered separately from the rest of Leicestershire. The county borders onto Lincolnshire, Rutland, Northamptonshire, Warwickshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, and Nottinghamshire.

Leicestershire was recorded in the Domesday Book.

Northamptonshire

Northamptonshire (abbreviated Northants or N'hants) is a county in central England with a population of 629,676 (2001 census). It has borders with Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Rutland, Cambridgeshire, Peterborough, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire (including the Borough of Milton Keynes), Oxfordshire, and Lincolnshire (England's shortest county boundary: 19 metres). The county town is Northampton.

Northamptonshire has often been called the county of "squires and spires" due to its wide variety of historic buildings and country houses.

Northampton is by far the largest town in the county, with a population of 194,122. This is followed by Corby (53,174), Wellingborough (48,428), Kettering (47,000), Rushden (25,849) and Daventry (22,367). Most of the county's population is concentrated in a central north-south.

Cherwell Edge in Northamptonshire () is near the River Cherwell, north-west of Banbury, England. The once heavily wooded hill and valley was mostly cleared many years ago. The area now also covers the near by Cherwell Edge Golf Club that was recently built by it too. The golf club is used by various local residents.

These are the main settlements in Northamptonshire with a town charter, a population over 5,000, or otherwise notable.

Two major canals - the Oxford and the Grand Union — join in the county at Braunston.
A branch of the Grand Union Canal connects to the River Nene in Northampton.
Two trunk railway routes, the West Coast Main Line and the Midland Main Line traverse the county.
Before nationalisation of the railways in 1948 and the creation of British Railways), Northamptonshire was home to three of the "Big Four" railway companies; the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, London and North Eastern Railway and Great Western Railway. Only the Southern Railway was not represented.

Fractal geometry

Fractal Geometry is the study of sets called fractals. When drawn, a fractal is very rough-looking. Also, it can be cut into parts which look quite like a smaller version of the set that was started with. Another thing that fractals have is a dimension which is not what people would expect - often it is not a whole number. Fractals have very simple descriptions. Last of all, even in very small parts of the set, the set will still look very rough.

The Koch Curve is a simple example of a fractal. First, start with part of a straight line - called a straight line segment. Cut the line into 3 same-sized pieces. Get rid of the middle of those pieces, and put in the top part of a triangle with sides which are the same length as the bit to cut out. We now have 4 line segments which are touching at the ends. We can now do what we just did to the first segment to each of the 4 bits. We can now do the same thing again and again to all the bits we end up with. We now do this forever and look at what we end up with.

The length of the Koch Curve is infinity, and the area of the Koch Curve is zero. This is quite strange. A line segment (with dimension 1) could have a length of 1, but it has an area of 0. A square of length 1 and width 1 (with dimension 2) will have area 1 and length of infinity.

So, the Koch Curve seems to be bigger than something of dimension 1, and smaller than something of dimension 2. The idea of the similarity dimension is to give a dimension which gives a better idea of length or area for fractals. So, for a Koch Curve, we want a dimension between 1 and 2.

The Koch Curve can be cut into 4 pieces, each of which are formula_1 of the size of the original. We call the number of pieces that a fractal can be cut into formula_2, and we call the size difference formula_3. We put those into the equation:

formula_4

Where formula_5 is the logarithm of a number. This number is the Hausdorff Dimension of the fractal. In the Koch Curve, this is formula_6 as we wanted.

The Koch Curve is one of the simplest fractal shapes, and so its dimension is easy to work out. Its similarity dimension and Hausdorff dimension are both the same. This is not true for more complex fractals.

The Koch snowflake (or Koch star) is the same as the Koch curve, except it starts with an equilateral triangle instead of a line segment.

Fractals have many applications e.g. in biology (lung, Kidneys, heart rate variability etc...), in earthquakes, in finance where it is related to the so called heavy tail distributions and in physics. This indicates that fractals should be studied to understand why fractals are so frequent in nature.

Earl

An Earl or Jarl was an Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian title, meaning "chieftain" and it referred especially to chieftains set to rule a territory in a king's stead. In Scandinavia, it got out of use in the Middle Ages, whereas, in Britain, it became synonymous with the continental count.

Today, an earl is a member of the British peerage and ranks below a Marquess and above a Viscount. A British Earl is equivalent to a continental Count. Since there is no feminine form of Earl, the wife of an Earl bears the rank of Countess (the continental equivalent).

Lobster

Lobsters are large crustaceans that live in the sea. They form the family of Nephorpidae, which is sometimes also called Homaridae. Lobsters are an economically important type of seafood.

Several different groups of crustaceans are known as lobsters. When people talk about lobsters, they mean "clawed lobsters" most of the time, such as the genus "Homarus". Clawed lobsters are not closely related to spiny lobsters or slipper lobsters, which have no claws ("chelae"), or squat lobsters. The closest relatives of clawed lobsters are the reef lobster "Enoplometopus" and the three groups of freshwater crayfish.

Smaller kinds are sometimes called "lobsterettes". Lobsters are invertebrates, and have a hard exoskeleton (outer skeleton), which protects them. Like most arthropods, lobsters must shed it in order to grow. This is called "moulting". It makes them weak and easy to attack during this time. When they are moulting, some species' colors might change.

Lobsters live on rocky, sandy, or muddy bottoms from the shore to beyond the edge of the continental shelf. They usually live alone in cracks or in under rocks.

Lobsters usually eat live food, consisting of fish, mollusks, other crustaceans, worms, and some plant life. Sometimes, they will scavenge (eat dead plants and animals) if necessary, and may eat each other (cannabalism) when they are in ; however, this has not been observed in the wild. Lobster skin in the stomachs of lobsters has been found before, although this is because lobsters will eat their shed skin after molting  . Lobsters grow throughout their lives and it is not unusual for a lobster to live for more than 100 years . They can thus reach impressive sizes. According to the Guinness World Records, the largest lobster was caught in Nova Scotia, Canada and weighed 20.14 kg (44.4 lb).
Being arthropods, lobsters are largely bilaterally symmetrical (they are the same on the left and right sides). Clawed lobsters often have unequal, specialized claws, like the king crab. A freshly caught lobster will have a claw that is full and fleshy, not small. Lobsters have the cephalothorax which is the head connected to the thorax, both of which are covered by the carapace , of chitinous composition, and the abdomen. The lobster's head has two pairs of antennae, three pairs of jaws. Because a lobster lives in a murky environment at the bottom of the ocean, its eyesight is poor and it mostly uses its antennae to feel around. Studies have shown that the lobster eye is formed with a reflective structure at the top a rounded retina (eye part). In contrast, most complex eyes use lenses that change the direction of rays and a inward-curving retina . The abdomen of the lobster includes swimming legs and a tail fan.

In general, lobsters move slowly by walking on the bottom of the sea floor. However, when they are in danger and need to escape, they swim backwards quickly by curling and uncurling their abdomen. A speed of 5 metres per second has been recorded.

<doc id="48324" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48324" title="Spiny lobster">
Spiny lobster

Spiny lobsters, also known as rock lobsters are a family (Palinuridae) of about 45 species of crustaceans, in the Decapoda Reptantia. Spiny lobsters are also called "crayfish", "sea crayfish" or "crawfish".

Although they superficially resemble true lobsters in terms of overall shape, and that they also have a hard carapace and exoskeleton, the two groups are not closely related. Spiny lobsters can be easily distinguished from true lobsters by their very long, thick, spiny antennae, and by their complete lack of claws ("chelae"); true lobsters have much smaller antennae and claws on the first three pairs of legs, with the first being particularly enlarged. Like true lobsters, however, spiny lobsters are edible and are an economically significant food source; they are the biggest food export of the Bahamas .

Spiny lobsters are found in almost all warm seas, including the Caribbean and the Mediterranean Sea, but are particularly common in Australasia, where they are referred to commonly as crayfish or sea crayfish ("Jasus novaehollandiae" and "Jasus edwardsii"), and South Africa ("Jasus lalandii"). A new species, "Palinurus barbarae" was described in 2006.

The largest spiny lobster on record was over 1 m (3 ft) long and weighed over 11.8 kg (26 lb).

Spiny lobsters tend to live in crevices of rocks and coral reefs, only occasionally venturing out at night to seek snails, clams, crabs, sea urchins or carrion to eat. Sometimes, they migrate "en masse", in long files of lobsters across the sea floor. Potential predators may be deterred from eating spiny lobsters by a loud screech made by the antennae of the spiny lobsters rubbing against a smooth part of the exoskeleton . Spiny lobsters usually exhibit social habit by being together. However recent studies indicate that healthy lobsters move away from infected ones and leaving the diseased lobsters to fend for itself .

The furry lobsters ("e.g." "Palinurellus") are sometimes separated into a family of their own, the Synaxidae, but are usually considered members of the Palinuridae. The slipper lobsters (Scyllaridae) are their next closest relatives, and these two or three families make up the Achelata. Genera of spiny lobsters include "Palinurus" and a number of anagrams thereof: "Panulirus", "Linuparus", "etc." (Palinurus was also a helmsman in Virgil's Æneid.)

Bromeliad

Bromeliads are a family of tropical plants which includes the pineapple and several colourful houseplants. They are nearly all from Latin America and the Caribbean islands, except for Spanish moss from the southern United States, and a single kind from Africa. 

Pineapples (Latin name: "Ananas"). See Pineapple.

Air plants (Latin name: "Tillandsia") are very curious because they do not need any roots to stay alive. Instead they soak up moisture from the air around them through tiny, silvery scales on their leaves. They have so many of these scales that the whole plant can look grey. In the wild they grow on tree banches in rainy and misty areas. In the Caribbean there is a kind that grows on telephone wires!

Urn plants (Latin name: "Aechmea") are easy to keep. They grow to about 60 cm across, but because the stiff, green-and-grey leaves have spiny edges, they need to be out of the way. Urn plants got their name because they have a hole in the middle made by the ring-shaped arrangement of their leaves. This central urn fills up with rainwater in the wild and is often home to insects and frogs. Its flowers are held high on a single stem, and protected by a globe of small, pink leaves which lasts for several months.

Vriesias (Latin names: "Vriesia" and "Guzmania") are like urn plants, but they have no spines and their leaves are softer. They are often sold in flower shops (and sometimes in supermarkets) and are very easy to look after. Their flowers grow on a single stem, protected by flattened, colourful leaves. It is better not to fill the central space with water, as these soft-leaved plants might rot. instead their soil should be watered.

Spanish moss (Latin name: "Tillandsia usneoides") is a grey plant found hanging from trees in the swamps of the southern United States, especially in Louisiana but as far east as coastal Virginia. To the south it spreads as far as Chile and Argentina. It gained its current name from Spanish and French colonisers in the Gulf of Mexico. The French called it "Barbe Espagnole" ("Spanish beard") to insult their rivals, and the Spanish in turn called it "Cabello francés" ("French hair"). Today "Spanish moss" survives as a mild version of the French taunt, although some call the plant "Graybeard". 

Bromelia, the plant which gives its name to the family, is the only other bromeliad with edible fruit. Its berries taste a bit like pineapple, but are less tasty, and there are not very many on each plant.

Fascicularia is the only bromeliad that can be grown in frosty areas. It is not killed by frost if it is kept dry in the winter.

Pitcairnia is the only wild bromeliad outside the Americas. One species, "Pitcairnia feliciana", was discoved living in West Africa. It is probably descended from seeds carried by migrating birds.

Puya is the largest bromeliad. It can grow up to nine metres tall. It lives in the Andes mountains, and is sometimes eaten by bears for its nectar. In Chile the young leaves of some puyas are eaten in salads.

An oscillator is something that "vibrates", or repeats the same pattern. Many things in nature move back-and-forth or up-and down when pushed or struck. In time, natural oscillators slow down and stop because of friction.

<doc id="48335" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48335" title="Eucalyptus">
Eucalyptus

Eucalyptus is a name for a kind of tree. Nearly all of them are from Australia. Eucalyptus can be found in almost every part of the Australia. 

There are more than 700 species of eucalypts. They have many local names, like gum trees, mallee, box, ironbark, stringybark and ash.

Eucalypts have special flowers and fruits that no other trees have. When it flowers a bud cap made of petals grows around the flower until it is ready to open. Then the bud cap falls off to reveal a flower with no petals. 

The woody fruits are called gumnuts. They are roughly cone-shaped and open at one end to release the seeds.
Nearly all eucalypts are evergreen but some tropical species lose their leaves at the end of the dry season. The leaves are covered with oil glands. These oils are often used to treat coughs and colds.

Many Eucalypts also change the shape of their leaves as they get older. Young eucalypts have round leaves. When one to a few years old, the leaves of most kinds become longer and spearhead or sickle shaped. A few kinds keep the round leaf shape all their lives. Most species do not flower until the adult leaves starts to appear.

The bark dies every year. In smooth-barked trees most of the bark falls off the tree, leaving a smooth surface that is often colourfully marked. With rough-barked trees the dead bark stays on the tree and dries out. Many kinds of eucalyptus trees have smooth bark at the top but rough bark lower down. These different kinds of bark are used to arrange the eucalypts into groups - this is useful because there are hundreds of kinds of eucalypts, and breaking down the group in this way makes the group easier to understand.

The different groups are:

Today, specimens of the Australian Mountain Ash, are among the tallest trees in the world at up to 92 metres in height and the tallest of all flowering plants; taller trees such as the Coast Redwood are all conifers. There is evidence that at the time of European settlement of Australia some Mountain Ash were indeed the tallest plants in the world.

Most eucalypts cannot survive frost, or can only stand light frosts down to -3 °C to -5 °C. The hardiest eucalypts are the so-called Snow Gums such as "Eucalyptus pauciflora" which is capable of withstanding cold and frost down to about -20 °C. Two sub-species (wild varieties) of this tree can survive even colder winters.

Several other kinds, especially from the high plateau and mountains of central Tasmania, have produced extreme cold-hardy forms. It is seed from these hardy strains that are planted for ornamental trees in colder parts of the world.

An oil found in eucalyptus leaves is a strong, natural disinfectant, which is used in some medicines, but can be poisonous if too much is taken. Several marsupials, such as koalas and some possums, are partly resistant to it. These animals can tell which plants are safe to eat by their smell. 

Eucalypts make a lot of nectar, providing food for many insects.

Eucalypts have a habit of dropping entire branches off as they grow. Eucalyptus forests are littered with dead branches. The Australian Ghost Gum "Eucalyptus papuana" is sometimes called the "widow maker", due to the high number of tree-felling workers who were killed by falling branches. Many deaths were actually caused by simply camping under them, as the trees shed whole and very large branches to save water during droughts. For this reason, you should "never" camp under large eucalyptus branches.

On warm days eucalyptus oil vapour rises above the bush to create the well-known distant blue haze of the Australian landscape. Eucalyptus oil catches fire very easily, and bush fires can travel quickly through the oil-rich air of the tree crowns. The dead bark and fallen branches are also flammable. Eucalypts are well adapted for periodic fires - in fact most species are dependent on them for spread and regeneration. They do this in several ways: by sprouting from underground tubers, hidden buds under their bark and from seeds sprouting in the ashes after the fire has opened them.

Eucalypts began between 35 and 50 million years ago, not long after Australia and New Guinea separated from Gondwana. Their coming coincides with an increase in fossil charcoal deposits (which might mean that fire was important to them even then), but they remained a minor component of the rainforest until about 20 million years ago, when the gradual drying of the continent and lessening of soil richness led to the growth of a more open forest type, with mainly "Casuarina" and "Acacia" trees. With the arrival of the first humans about 50 thousand years ago, fires became much more frequent and the fire-loving eucalypts soon came to account for roughly 70% of Australian forest.

Eucalypts grow back quickly after fire. 
The two valuable timber trees, Alpine Ash and Mountain Ash, are killed by fire and only grow back from seeds. The same fire which had little impact on forests around Canberra has resulted in thousands of hectares of dead forests.

Eucalypts have many uses which have made them important. Because of their fast growth, the main benefit of these trees is the wood. They provide many uses, such as planting in parks and gardens, timber, firewood and pulpwood. Fast growth also makes eucalypts suitable as windbreaks.

Eucalypts draw a very large amount of water from the soil. They have been planted (or re-planted) in some places to lower the water table and reduce the amount of salt in the soil. Eucalypts have also been used as a way of reducing malaria by draining the soil in such places as Algeria, Sicily mainland Europe and California. Drainage removes swamps which provide a habitat for mosquito larvae, but such drainage can also destroy harmless habitats by accident.

Eucalyptus oil is refined from the leaves by steaming. It can be used for cleaning, deodorising, and in very small amounts in food supplements, especially sweets, cough drops and decongestants. Eucalyptus oil is an insect repellent (Fradin & Day 2002).

The nectar of some eucalyptus produces high quality honey. In the western United States the flowering is in late January, before the flowering of other nut and fruit trees; this means that its nectar can be easily made into its own kind of honey, which is said to have a buttery taste.

The ghost gum's leaves were used by Aborigines to catch fish. Soaking the leaves in water releases a mild tranquiliser which stuns fish, making them easy to catch.

Eucalyptus is also used to make the digeridoo, a musical wind instrument made popular by the Aborigines.

Eucalypts were first introduced to the rest of the world by Sir Joseph Banks, botanist on the Cook expedition in 1770. They have since been introduced to many parts of the world. Several species have become invasive (spreading out of the area they were planted in) and are causing major problems for local wildlife. 

In Spain, they have been planted in pulpwood plantations, replacing native oak woodland. As in other such areas, while the original woodland supports kinds of native animal life, the eucalypt groves cannot support the local wildlife, leading to silent forests and the decline of wildlife populations. On the other hand, eucalyptus helps several industries, such as sawmilling, pulp, and charcoal making. 

In the 1850s many Australians traveled to California to take part in the California Gold Rush. Much of California has similar climate to parts of Australia, and some people had the idea of introducing eucalyptus. By the early 1900s thousands of hectares of eucalyptus were planted with the encouragement of the state government. It was hoped that they would provide a renewable source of timber for construction and furniture making. However this did not happen partly because the trees were cut when they were too young and partly because the Americans did not know how to process the cut trees to prevent the wood from twisting and splitting.

One way in which the eucalyptus, mainly the blue gum, proved valuable in California was in providing windbreaks for highways, orange groves, and other farms in the mostly treeless central part of the state. They are also admired as shade and ornamental trees in many cities and gardens.

Eucalyptus forests in California have been criticized because they drive out the native plants and do not support native animals. Fire is also a problem. The 1991 Oakland Hills firestorm which destroyed almost 3,000 homes and killed 25 people was partly fueled by large numbers of eucalyptus in the area close to the houses.

In some parts of California eucalyptus forests are being removed, and native trees and plants restored. Some people have also illegally destroyed some trees and are suspected of bringing in insect pests from Australia which attack the trees.

In 1910 the eucalyptus were introduced on Brazil for timber substitution and the charcoal industry. Regrettably the long term effects were not studied, and in the present the eucalyptus is causing problems because of its high consumption of water. This causes the soil to dry out, killing many local plants which the local animals need to survive.

Cell theory

Cell theory is a way to describe the biology of living things. Cell theory says that the cell is the basic unit of life. Cells by themselves are alive, but they can also be part of a larger living thing. The smallest living organisms (like bacteria but not viruses) and the biggest ones (like humans and whales) are all made of cells. Very small organisms like bacteria and amoebas are only made of one cell each, so they are called unicellular organisms ("uni" means "one"). Larger organisms are made of many cells, and they are called multicellular organisms.

Cell theory has 3 basic points: 

Cells are born from older cells, in a process called cell division. Cells contain information that is passed from the parent cell to the daughter cells, so that the daughter cells can do what they need to do. This information is carried on molecules called DNA.

Because cells are alive, they must be able to eat and do other things to stay alive. All cells have chemical ways of consuming food. These are part of its metabolism.

Even though there are many kinds of cells, they have some similarities too. Many of the chemicals inside of them are the same.

Robert Hooke discovered cells in 1663. He used a microscope to look at a piece of cork cambium. What he saw through the microscope reminded him of the small rooms that monks lived in. These rooms were called "cellula" in Latin, so Hooke called his discovery "cells". Hooke did not know that he was looking at dead cell walls and not living cells.. These cell walls did not have the nucleus and other organelles found in most living cells.

The first man to look at a live cell under a microscope was Anton van Leeuwenhoek. In 1674, he described the algae "Spirogyra". He also described bacteria, which he called "animacules".

Oxfordshire

Oxfordshire (short Oxon, from the Latinised form "Oxonia") is a county in the South East of England, bordering on Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, and Warwickshire.

It is divided into five local government districts: Oxford, Cherwell, Vale of the White Horse (after the "Uffington White Horse"), "West Oxfordshire" and "South Oxfordshire".

The county has a major tourism industry. The area is known for the concentration of motorsport companies and facilities. Oxford University Press has headed a concentration of print and publishing firms; the university is also linked to the concentration of local biotechnology companies.

The main centre of population is the city of Oxford. Other significant settlements are Bicester, Banbury, and Chipping Norton to the north of Oxford; Witney to the west; Thame and Chinnor to the east; and Abingdon, Wantage, Didcot and Henley-on-Thames to the south. Future population growth in the county is hoped to be concentrated around Banbury, Bicester, Didcot and Witney, near the South Midlands growth area.

The highest point of the county is Whitehorse Hill, in the Vale of White Horse, reaching 856 feet (261m).

The county of Oxfordshire was formed in the early years of the 10th century.

Historically the area has always had some importance, it has been good agricultural land resting between the main southern cities and Oxford (whose name came from Anglo-Saxon "Oxenaford" = "ford for oxen"). The area was part of the Cotswolds wool trade from the 13th century. The Great Western Railway reached Didcot in 1839. Morris Motors was founded in Oxford in 1912 and MG in Abingdon in 1929. The importance of agriculture as an employer has gone down in the 20th century; today less than one percent of the county's population are involved.

The Vale of the White Horse and parts of South Oxfordshire south of the River Thames were historically part of Berkshire, but were added to the administrative county in 1974.

<doc id="48364" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48364" title="Minnie Mouse">
Minnie Mouse

Minnie Mouse is a cartoon character. She is Mickey Mouse's girlfriend. They were both created by Walt Disney. Her birthday is on 18th November 1928. But she only first appeared in 1928, in “Plane Crazy”. She is also known as Princess Minnie and Maestro Minnie. Minnie's favourite foods are cheese, chocolate and cake. She loves listening to Jazz Music. 

Minnie Mouse’s parents are both farmers. Marcus Mouse is her father’s name. His name was first used in the comic strip story “Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers” (published 22 September- 26 December, 1930). But Minnie’s mother’s name is Margie Mouse. Minnie Mouse also has a sister called Mandie Mouse. Minnie Mouse has twin nieces, Millie and Melody, [Mandie's daughters], they are rarely seen now and when they are seen they are on their own [without the other twin]. Marshal Mouse, Marcus Mouse's father and Minnie Mouse's grandfather, was also a farmer. He is also seen in "Mr Slicker and the Egg Robbers".

Minnie Mouse has two pets, a dog and a cat. The dog is called Fifi. Fifi has 5 puppies with Mickey’s dog, Pluto. Pluto was Mickey’s first dog; he was called Rover at that time. She also has a cat called Figaro, this is the same cat which appears in the Disney movie Pinocchio.

Walt Disney said in a interview in 1933 that in private Mickey and Minnie are married. He also said that many people asked him about this. Depending on the movie, Minnie and Mickey are married or sometimes not married but always married and not married.

From 19th January 1942 to 2nd May 1942 there was a comic magazine called “The Gleam”. In this magazine once it said that Minnie’s real name was Minerva Mouse. But the Walt Disney head office said that there is no register about her real name as Minerva. There is not much information about Minerva, but she is similar to Minnie’s character. Therefore many people miss understood that Minerva was Minnie’s real name. Formally Minnie’s name is only registered as “Minnie Mouse”.
However some sources say that Minerva is Minnie’s real name, and that Minnie’s full name is Minerva “Minnie” Mouse.
More likely is that Minnie's original name was the German/Dutch Wilhelmina, which is about the only name for which Minnie is the "official" abbreviation (http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/0/Minnie). Possibly, this fact was suppressed during the 1930s, as Germany became more unpopular due to its political and racial leanings.

It seems that Minnie’s closest friends are Daisy Duck, Donald Duck’s girlfriend, and also sometimes Clarabelle Cow. She often goes shopping with Daisy and she spends a lot of time with her. Her friendship with Daisy is more of a product of recent cartoons, as they never interacted with each other during the Classic shorts. Minnie also has another friend called Honor the Hippo and they keep their secrets in bits of moss on the pavement. Minnie's other friend Carly the Cat has a middle parting in her long hair.

Notostraca

The order Notostraca has just two living genera in it. "Triops" and "Lepidura". The two genera are considered 'living fossils', as they have not changed in outward form since the Triassic.

Notostracans, or tadpole shrimps, are omnivores living on the bottom of temporary pools and shallow lakes. They live in pools of water on every continent except Antarctica. They grow very quickly, and can reach adulthood in a week. "Triops" only live for a short time; a record-breaking female only lived to be 100 "days". When their pools dry up,adult tadpole shrimp die. Their eggs, however, stop developing for a time. When they are in water again, they come to life, and new "Triops" are hatched. This is because of a state known as diapause, where eggs can lie dormant for up to twenty years before hatching again.

The fossil record of Notostraca is extensive. They occur in a wide range of geological deposits, reaching back to the Carboniferous. The lack of major morphological change since 250 million years ago has led to Notostraca being described as living fossils.

The Notostraca abandonned filter feeding in open water, and took up a benthic lifestyle in muddy waters, taking up food from particles of sediment and preying on small animals.

Notostracans keep the ancient condition of having two separate compound eyes. These touch but do not become united, as does happens in other groups of Branchiopods.

Porphyria

Porphyria is the name for certain medical conditions or diseases. Those who suffer from the disease can not make certain substances in the blood. The condition may be because of a genetic deficiency or because it was acquired in some way. This will manifest in either skin problems, or some diseases of the nervous system, or both. Drugs are available that can at least treat the symptoms. This disease is most common in European countries and often affects the skin. When someone is affected by Porphyria they will start to lose their hair about two weeks after having an attack. There is no cure for the hair loss, however, there is medication available to help prevent attacks.

Diatom

Diatoms (Greek: "dia" = through + "temnein" = to cut: "cut through") are a big group of eukaryotic algae. They are one of the most common types of phytoplankton. Most diatoms are unicellular, although some form chains or simple colonies. Diatom cells are encased within a unique cell wall made of silica (SiO). These walls, called frustules, take many forms, some quite beautiful and ornate. They usually consist of two asymmetrical sides with a split between them, which gives the group its name.

Diatom chloroplasts were probably derived from those of red algae. The fossil record of diatoms starts in strata of the Lower Jurassic, ~185 million years ago. Molecular clock evidence suggests an earlier date for their origin. The entire genomes of two species of diatom have been analysed. The analysis reveals that hundreds of genes in both species came from bacteria.

Diatoms have some practical uses. Diatom communities are a popular tool for monitoring environmental conditions, past and present. They are commonly used in studies of water quality. They are also of interest to nanotechnology.

Decapitation

Decapitation or beheading is the act of cutting off the head from the rest of the body of a living thing. "Beheading" usually means that the removal of the head is intentional. It is generally done during a murder or execution with an axe, sword, or guillotine. If the removal of the head is an accident or unintentional, it is called "decapitation". It can happen because of an auto accident, explosion, factory accident, a mistake during a hanging or some other violent accident.

Decapitation is always fatal, that is, the result is always death.

Decapitation can also describe the removal of a head from a body that is already dead. In these situations, the head is usually a trophy or a public display of warning.

Beheading was the usual means of death penalty in Scandinavian countries in the past. Noblemen were behaded with a sword, commoners with an axe. The last execution by beheading in Finland occurred in 1822, when a farmhand Tahvo Putkonen was beheaded for murder. The last beheading in Sweden occurred in 1910, when Johan Andersson-Ander was guillotined for murder. Also Germany, France and Belgium favoured beheading in the past. In those countries was carried out by guillotine.

Last beheading in Europe occurred 1977, when a Tunisian murderer Hamida Djandoubi was guillotined in France. 

Some countries, especially Arab countries or former French colonies, still use beheading as the means of execution. In Saudi Arabia, the convicts are beheaded with a sword.

The executioner who performs beheadings is called a headsman.

Dmitri Mendeleev

Dimitri Mendeleev (born Dmitriy Ivanovich Mendeleyev, February 8 (O.S. January 27) 1834 in Tobolsk – February 2 (O.S. January 20) 1907 in Saint Petersburg) was a Russian chemist. He is said to be the main creator of the first version of the periodic table of elements. Many of the predictions made in his periodic table (such as the properties of elements undiscovered at the time) were later proved correct by experiments.

Mendeleev was born in Verhnie Aremzyani village, near Tobolsk, to Ivan Pavlovich Mendeleev and Maria Dmitrievna Mendeleeva (née Kornilieva). His grandfather was Pavel Maximovich Sokolov, a priest of Russian Orthodox Church from the Tver region. Ivan, along with his brothers and sisters, obtained new family names while attending theological seminary.

Mendeleev is thought to be the youngest of 14 siblings, but the exact number differs among sources. At the age of 13, after the death of his father and the destruction of his mother's factory by fire, Mendeleev attended the Gymnasium in Tobolsk.

In 1849, the now poor Mendeleev family relocated to Saint Petersburg, where he entered the Main Pedagogical Institute in 1850. After graduation, tuberculosis caused him to move to the Crimean Peninsula on the northern coast of the Black Sea in 1855. While there he became a science master of the Simferopol gymnasium №1. He returned with fully restored health to Saint Petersburg in 1857.

Work was made by others in the 1860s to suggest that the elements display periodicity. John Newlands, who published his Law of Octaves in 1865. The lack of spaces for undiscovered elements and the placing of two elements in one box were criticized and his ideas were not accepted. Another was Lothar Meyer, who published a work in 1864, describing 28 elements. Neither attempted to predict new elements. In 1863 there were 56 known elements with a new element being discovered at a rate of approximately one per year.

Mendeleev made other important contributions to chemistry. The Russian chemist and science historian L.A. Tchugayev has characterized him as "a chemist of genius, first-class physicist, a fruitful researcher in the fields of hydrodynamics, meteorology, geology, certain branches of chemical technology (explosives, petroleum, and fuels, for example) and other disciplines adjacent to chemistry and physics, a thorough expert of chemical industry and industry in general, and an original thinker in the field of economy." Mendeleev was one of the founders, in 1869, of the Russian Chemical Society. He worked on the theory and practice of protectionist trade and on agriculture.

<doc id="48410" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48410" title="Wakizashi">
Wakizashi

The wakizashi is a traditional Japanese sword. It is shorter than the katana, which was well known in the beginning of the 17th century as a "kodachi" sword. The two swords were always carried together: the wakizashi finished off the work of the katana sword. Such a sword could be from 30cm to 60cm (12 to 24 inches) long. A small version was called a "ko-wakizashi", a longer one was called an "o-wakizashi". 

A wakizashi had a slightly curved blade with a square-shaped hilt (handle). The hilt and the scabbard (the case in which the sword is kept) of a wakizashi was richly decorated with traditional motifs. A wakizashi was more decorated than a katana because it was not used as much as a katana, but still carried everywhere. Another distinctive feature is the scabbard (called a "saya"). The sayas were made to be like the katana but they could have extra pockets for smaller knives, a hair arranger, etc. 

The katana and the wakizashi together are called a daishō, which is translated as "large and small". The first part of the word ("dai") means "big" and stands for the katana sword; the second ("sho") stands for wakizashi. Wakizashi was more decorated than a katana and it was thinner, this is why it was designed to cut through softer targets. So it was a sword to make dangerous cuts in weak points of the human body. The use of a daishō on the battlefield gave its user a big advantage. With the two swords the samurai could keep the enemies within a radius of action ranging from 2 to 7 feet (1 to 3 1/2 meters). Miyamoto Musashi, a famous Japanese samurai, was especially skilful at using the daishō.

A wakizashi sword was an irreplaceable weapon for a samurai. The tradition says that when entering a house or any other building, the samurai has to leave his katana with a servant, but the wakizashi could be worn at all times and places. This is why the wakizashi is often called the samurai's "side arm". The wakizashi followed his master even when he went to sleep, because it was always near the bed. 

The wakizashi was carried along the thigh and was usually used with one hand; the other hand was used for the katana. The wakizashi proved to be very effective when the katana's length and weight made it hard to use. The wakizashi needs less force to use and it is more maneuverable. 

The wakizashi was also the sword used by merchants and artisans (types of traders) who were forbidden from wearing a katana. This fact explains a greater number wakizashi swords were found than katanas. There are even more wakizashi swords than katana swords, although the katana swords had greater meaning for Japanese society. 

The wakizashi sword was much used in the ritual of seppuku (suicide because of lost honor). In this ritual it was used along with the shortest Japanese sword - Tanto. The wakizashi was thrust into the torso (body), cutting open vertically. This kind of death was considered honorable for a samurai. When a female samurai committed seppuku she would only cut her own throat.

Albert Camus

Albert Camus (November 7, 1913 – January 4, 1960) was a French philosopher and writer. Camus wrote novels and plays. Camus was born in Algeria, a country in the North part of Africa. He had French parents. Many people think that Camus is an existentialist philosopher. Existentialism is a philosophy that is very different from other ways of thinking. Camus won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957.

Albert Camus was born in Algeria to a poor working class family. His mother was Spanish and his father was French. His father died in battle and he was left to live with his grandmother. When he was 17 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, which was very impactful on him at that point in his life. It limited him greatly in his athletics as well as in his career opportunities, due to the fact that tuberculosis is quite contagious. For this reason he claimed that his disease “set him free” because he would have done something else with his life had he seen the opportunity. He went to the University of Algiers, where he graduated with a degree in 1935. In the 1930s, Camus became interested in politics. In 1935, Camus joined the French Communist Party, a political group. In the late 1930s, Camus was a writer for the socialist newspaper, the "Alger-Republicain".

In 1941, Camus wrote his first novel, which was called "The Stranger". During World War II, Camus joined the French Resistance to fight against the Nazi army. After World War II, Camus became friends with another writer called Jean-Paul Sartre. Camus and Sartre often talked about philosophy and politics in small restaurants called cafés.

Camus wrote books about philosophy (ways of thinking) which said that life was "absurd" (makes no sense, or has no meaning). In the 1950s Camus tried to improve human rights. In 1960, Camus died in a car crash. He had two children, Catherine and Jean.

The Angevin Empire was a collection of states ruled by the Angevin Plantagenet dynasty. The Plantagenets, Henry II of England, Richard I of England, and John of England, ruled over an area from the Pyrenees to Ireland during the 12th and early 13th centuries. Their empire was roughly half of medieval France as well as all of England and Ireland. The name "Angevin" came from the French region and town of Anjou which was the home of the Plantagenet family.

<doc id="48423" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48423" title="Sea of Galilee">
Sea of Galilee

The Sea of Galilee is Israel's largest freshwater lake, about 53 kilometers (33 miles) around, about 21 km (13 miles) long, and 13 km (8 miles) wide; it has a total area of 166 km², and a depth of about 43 meters. At 209 meters below sea level, it is the lowest freshwater lake on Earth, and the second lowest lake in the world after the Dead Sea, a saltwater lake. It is not a real sea - it is called a sea because of tradition. 

The lake is also known on modern maps as Lake Galilee or Lake Tiberias, in the region of Galilee. In modern Hebrew, it is known as (ים כנרת), "Sea of Kinnereth" (Numbers 34:11; Joshua 13:27). It has also been called the Lake of Gennesaret or the Sea of Gennesaret (Luke 5:1) after the name of a small fruitful plain on its western side. The Arabic name for the lake is (بحيرة طبريا) meaning "Lake Tiberias". Other names are: Ginnosar, Lake of Gennesar, Sea of Chinneroth, Sea of Tiberias (Roman) and Waters of Gennesareth.

Its main source is the Jordan River, which flows through it from north to south. The lake is deep in the Jordan Great Rift Valley, the valley caused by the separation of the African and Arabian Plates. Because of this, the area has earthquakes and, in the past, volcanic activity. 

Due to its low-lying position in the rift valley, surrounded by hills, the sea can get sudden violent storms; as in the New Testament story about Jesus calming the storm. A main feature of the lake seems to be that it is always changing. It is still famous, just as in New Testament times, for having plenty of fish, and in today's restaurants, "St. Peter's Fish" (tilapia) is very popular.

The Sea of Galilee is on the ancient Via Maris road which linked Egypt with the northern empires. The Greeks, Hasmoneans, and Romans started towns and settlements here: Gadara, Hippos, Tiberias and others. The 1st century historian Flavius Josephus wrote of a large fishing industry at this time, with 230 boats regularly working in the lake.
Much of the ministry of Jesus was on the shores of Lake Galilee. In those days, there were many settlements and villages all around the lake and plenty of trade and ferrying by boat. The gospels of Mark (1:14-20), Matthew (4:18-22), and Luke (5:1-11) tell how Jesus got four of his apostles from the shores of Lake Galilee: the fishermen Simon and his brother Andrew, and the brothers John and James. One of Jesus' famous teachings, the Sermon on the Mount, was given on a hill overlooking the lake. Many of his miracles were also recorded to have been here: his walking on water, calming a storm, feeding five thousand people and many others.

In 135, the second Jewish revolt against the Romans, called Bar Kokhba's revolt, was put down. The Romans responded by sending all Jews away from Jerusalem and not letting them come back. The center of Jewish culture and learning thus moved to the region of the Kinneret, particularly to the city of Tiberias. 

In the time of the Byzantine Empire, the lake's importance in Jesus' life made it a major destination for Christian pilgrims. This led to the growth of a tourist industry, with package tours and plenty of comfortable inns.

The lake lost importance when the Byzantines lost control of it. The area came under the control of the Umayyad Caliphate and later Islamic empires. Except for Tiberias, little by little, the major towns and cities began to be left empty. In 1187, Saladin defeated the armies of the Crusades at the Battle of Hattin, mainly because he cut the Crusaders off from the valuable fresh water of the Sea of Galilee.

In 1909 Jewish pioneers built their first cooperative farming village (kibbutz), Kvutzat Kinneret which trained Jewish immigrants in farming and agriculture. Kinneret was the center of the Kibbutz culture of early Zionism.

In 1923 an agreement between the United Kingdom and France set the border between the British Mandate of Palestine and the French Mandate of Syria. The British gave the southern Golan Heights to the French in return for the northern Jordan Valley. The border was drawn again so that both sides of the Jordan river and the whole of the Sea of Galilee, including a 10-meter wide strip along the northeastern shore, were made a part of Palestine. The 1947 UN Partition Plan put this area inside the Jewish state.
During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Syria occupied the lake's northeastern shore. In 1967, the State of Israel took control of the entire Sea of Galilee, as well as the Golan, during the Six Day War. Syria still claims the northeastern shore of the sea, arguing it is a part of the Golan Heights. 

Israel's National Water Carrier, built in 1964, takes water from the lake to the population centers of Israel, and is the source of most of the country's drinking water. Israel also supplies water from the lake to the West Bank and to Jordan (under the terms of the Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace). More demand for water and some dry winters have resulted in a lower water level that is sometimes dangerous.

Today, tourism is again very important in the area. The entire Sea of Galilee is a popular holiday resort area. The many historical and spiritual sites around the lake, especially its main town Tiberias, are visited by millions of local and foreign tourists every year. Other economic activities include fishing in the lake and agriculture, particularly bananas, in the fertile belt of land surrounding it.

A key attraction is the site where the Kinneret's water flows into the Jordan River. Thousands of pilgrims from all over the world come to be (re-)baptized there every year.

Seppuku

Seppuku is a Japanese ritual when a Samurai cuts his belly. It was considered that seppuku was an honorable way to die. 
Seppuku is also referred to as hara-kiri, which is translated from Japanese as "belly-cutting". The Japanese considered, though, that this name was offensive for such an honorable cause.

Seppuku was a key part of bushido, the code of the samurai warriors; it was used by warriors so that they would not fall into enemy hands and be ashamed. It was possible also that a samurai received an order from his master to commit seppuku. Since seppuku was an honorable act, a warrior was allowed, in some cases, to commit it, rather than to be executed, so that he could protect his honor. It was not expected that warriors, who were not considered samurai, to commit seppuku. Samurai women had to ask for permission to commit seppuku.
This act could be performed either with a ritual, or quietly on the battlefield, while other warriors fight the enemy.
The main weapon used to commit seppuku was the samurai's knife called tantō or the short sword, called wakizashi. A samurai who wants to commit seppuku would take the weapon he chose, he would open his kimono, stab the blade into his belly and then he would make a deep cut from left to right. An assistant of the warrior committing seppuku (called "kaishakunin") would finally decapitate the warrior.

Sow bug

A sow bug or woodlouse is a small land arthropod (jointed-legged animal). They are often confused with centipedes, millipedes or insects, but are actually crustaceans. They have fourteen legs and breathe through gills. Because of the gills, woodlice need water in the air around them. They mostly eat dead plants, and are considered helpful, because they act as "garbage collectors." Some species can roll up into a ball when in danger. In such position, their hard shell faces out, protecting the softer parts of the body.

Sow bugs do not look like shrimps or crabs, although they are closely related.

<doc id="48437" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48437" title="Lady beetle">
Lady beetle

Lady beetles are the Coccinellidae, a family of beetles. All species are protected by noxious fluids based on cyanide, and most have warning colouration, such as red with black spots.

They are often called "lady bugs" or "ladybirds", but biologists prefer the term "lady beetle".

Coccinellids are found worldwide, with over 5,000 species. Most species are carnivorous, feeding mainly on 
the "true bugs", the Hemiptera. Their favourite food is pests such as aphids (greenfly) or scale insects. Their larvae are also voracious (greedy) eaters of greenfly.

"Harmonia axyridis" (or the Harlequin ladybug) was introduced into North America from Asia in 1988 to control aphids but is now the most common species as it is out-competing many of the native species. It has since spread to much of western Europe, reaching the UK in 2004.

Coccinellids are often brightly coloured to warn potential predators. This phenomenon is called aposematism and works because predators learn by experience to associate certain prey phenotypes (appearance) with a bad taste (or worse).

Mechanical stimulation (such as by predator attack) causes "reflex bleeding" in both larval and adult ladybird beetles, in which a toxin is put through the joints of the exoskeleton, deterring feeding. This method works well; birds and cats seldom try twice.

Most people know lady beetles as small, round, red beetles with black spots on their backs. 

Not all lady beetles are red, and not all red lady beetles have spots. Some lady beetles are very little and are black and hairy. Lady beetles vary in color as red, orange, or yellow with black spots. They can also be black with red spots. Some are missing spots altogether. There are even a few kinds of ladybeetles with metallic blue iridescence, and some have checkerboard markings or stripes.

Most of the black part of the ladybeetle is the thorax, also called the pronotum. It sometimes has spots on it, and sometimes it is all black.

Most coccinellids as adults. In "Harmonia axyridis", eggs hatch in 3–4 days from clutches numbering from a few to several dozen. Depending on resource availability, the larvae pass through four instars over 10–14 days, after which pupation occurs. After several days, the adults become reproductively active and are able to reproduce again, though not late in the season. Total life span is 1–2 years on average.

It only takes about four weeks for the ladybeetle to transform from a tiny egg to an adult. Some females can lay up to 1,000 eggs in one summer. The ladybeetle may lay her eggs near an aphid colony, or on plants where the larvae will have a ready supply of food when they hatch.

Almost all lady beetles are insectivores, which means they eat other insects. Many of these insects have soft bodies, such as aphids. Even baby lady beetles eat other insects. Aphids are a huge problem for farmers and gardeners, and therefore a ladybug is a very good help to the farmers. Some species of ants herd aphids like sheep, and will attack a ladybeetle that tries to eat one of their aphids.

Thirteen Colonies

The Thirteen Colonies were British colonies in North America. The colonies were started for a few reasons. Some people thought they would make a lot of money in new goods in America that could not be found in Europe, such as tobacco. Others left to find religious freedom or just to make a new start. Some wanted to be in charge and change things that they did not like in England. The first colony was Virginia. It was started in 1607 at Jamestown. The last colony of the thirteen to be started was Georgia in 1732.

The Thirteen Colonies (listed from north to south):

After the French and Indian War, Great Britain made new taxes and other laws that angered some people in the colonies. This led to war between Great Britain and its former colonies. This war was called the American Revolutionary War. The colonies said they were independent of Great Britain on July 4, 1776, in the Declaration of Independence. The colonies became known as the United States of America.

Stillbirth

A stillbirth happens when a fetus (unborn baby) dies while still inside the mother or dies during delivery (childbirth). It is said that the delivered baby is "stillborn". Stillbirth is different from a miscarriage because a stillbirth happens after the baby has been living inside its mother 20 to 24 weeks (depending on the country). It is called a miscarriage if the baby lived inside the mother for less time.

The causes of many stillbirths are unknown, even when autopsies are done on the baby. Some possible causes include:

The number of stillbirths in the United States is about 1 in 115 births, which is about 26,000 a year, or one every 20 minutes. In developing countries, where medical care is not as advanced or good, the number of stillbirths is higher. 

In Australia, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the rate is about 1 in 200 babies. .

In the UK, any baby that leaves its mother's body after 24 weeks and does not show any signs of life is called a "stillbirth". The parent(s) must register the baby and a Stillbirth Certificate is given to the parent(s). 

In Australia, any stillborn fetus that weighs more than 400 grams and lived in the mother for more than 20 weeks must be registered.

The United States does not have a formal definition of "stillborn" babies. All pregnancies are legally called either: "live birth", "fetal death", or "induced termination of pregnancy" (abortion). The law does not have a difference between a stillbirth and a miscarriage. However, it is recommended to register infants who weighed over 350 grams or who lived over 19 weeks inside the mother before dying.

Art films are usually made by smaller movie companies. These companies do not have much money compared to the large movie studios, for example, Paramount Pictures or Walt Disney Pictures. Art films usually have different plots (stories) than blockbuster movies. They usually tell more creative or unusual stories than blockbuster movies. 

Art films often show controversial or sad stories. These types of movies may have sad endings. They are sometimes hard to understand, because the movie may be about people's feelings, thoughts, or dreams. 

For these reasons, art films are not shown in many cinemas or theaters. This means that art films do not have large audiences and do not make a lot of money. They are generally promoted by people who see the movie and then tell their friends to go see it.

The opposite of an art film is a popular blockbuster movie. Blockbuster movies have famous actors and large budgets. They are made so that millions of people will pay money to see the movie. 

To understand why movie directors make art movies, one has to know about blockbuster movies. Blockbuster movies are part of the reason why people make art films. Movie directors making art films try to make them very different from blockbuster movies. The movie is a more personal statement by the director. Blockbusters are made for commercial reasons and art films are made for personal reasons.

Blockbuster movies often have very large budgets. This money is used to pay large salaries for the actors. It pays for special effects and for advertisements. Art movies have small budgets. They usually have unknown or little-known actors. Some even use amateur actors. Some art films will even use regular people with no experience as actors to work as the actors. It is not uncommon for Art film directors to use friends and family members as actors. 

Blockbusters often use simple stories and characters that have been used before in other movies. Art movies usually use strange or unusual stories and characters that the audience may not have seen before.

In blockbuster movies, there is usually a happy ending. All of the problems in the story are figured out or fixed by the end of the movie. In art movies, there is often a sad ending. They can also have endings which are either hard to understand or could mean many different things. These endings are used so that the audience will have to think about what might have happened in the story. 

Blockbuster movies have a large amount of television advertising, billboards and internet sites. Art films often have little or no advertising.

Blockbuster movies are very popular. This causes more movies to be made using the same story and characters. For example, the "James Bond" movies all tell stories about the British spy named James Bond. The "Star Wars" science fiction movies all tell stories about spaceships and outer space wars. Art films are very rarely made into franchises with sequels. This is because directors of art films are often trying to create a new movie with new ideas for each movie they make. Some art films do have sequels. This will most often happen when the movie was very well liked and the director wanted to tell more stories using some of the same characters. 

Rarely, an art film can be so well liked that a franchise is created because of it. The "View Askew" universe is an example of this. Kevin Smith wrote and directed the movie "Clerks". He produced the movie himself with a friend, Scott Mosier. They named their production company, View Askew Productions. This movie was an art film. It had a small budget, dealt with personal issues and its actors were mainly Smith's friends and family. Smith even played one of the characters himself. The movie was very popular and sold well when it was released on DVD. Universal Pictures, a large Hollywood studio, asked him to make a movie for them. He used two of his characters from "Clerks", Jay and Silent Bob, as part of the new movie. He later used Jay (played by Jason Mewes and Silent Bob (played by Smith) is three other movies he wrote: "Dogma", "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" and "Clerks 2", a sequel to "Clerks". 

David Bordwell is a professor from the United States. He studies movies at a university. He thought of a way of explaining what an "art film" is in 1979. He wrote that art films are different from regular Hollywood movies. Regular Hollywood movies have a clear story and plot. Art film often have much stranger stories. In an art film, the stories may be hard to understand. As well, in an art film, the audience may have a hard time understanding what is going on. Art movies are often about people's feelings and thoughts. Art movies are often about big questions that a person has to answer about who they are or what they should do in a situation.

Steppe

In physical geography, a steppe is a plain without trees (apart from those near rivers and lakes); it is similar to a prairie, although a prairie is generally considered as being dominated by tall grasses, while short grasses are said to be the norm in the steppe. The world's largest steppe, sometimes called The Great Steppe, is in Russia. Another large steppe area is located in the central United States and western Canada.

It may be semi-desert, or covered with grass or shrubs or both, depending on the season and latitude. The term is also means the sort of climate that is to be found in regions too dry for a forest, but not so dry that there are only deserts. The soil is too moist for a desert, but too dry for normal forest life. Steppes receive slightly more rain than deserts do.

Champagne (wine)

Champagne is a sparkling wine that is named after the Champagne region, a region in France with many vineyards that grow grapes and make wine. Many people call all sparkling wines "champagne" but according to trade laws, only sparkling wine from the Champagne region can be called champagne. 

Champagnes must be made from certain kinds of grapes. They can be made from white Chardonnay grapes, or red Pinot Noir or Pinot Meunier grapes. Even if red grapes are used, most champagnes look white or sometimes pink (rosé).

Champagnes have different names depending on how much sugar is added. Here is a list of kinds of champagnes from least sweet (called "dry") to most sweet (called "wet"/"doux"):

"Brut" is the most common type of champagne.

Champagne, like all sparkling wines, is carbonated. Because of all the bubbles, champagne is sometimes called "bubbly" (ex. "We're going to have "bubbly" at our wedding.")

Champagne can be opened in a way that the cork "pops" out and the champagne sprays out in a bubbly foam. Usually this is done only at celebrations. It can be achieved by shaking the bottle before opening it. Normally, care should be taken when opening champagne bottles so that it does not make a mess. When done correctly, the cork will come out quietly, more like a sigh than a pop.

Champagne is usually served in a champagne flute (a tall, narrow glass). The shape of the glass helps keep the bubbles for a longer time.

Champagne is always served cold (chilled). The best temperature is 7 to 9 °C (43 to 48 °F). Often the bottle is chilled in a bucket of ice before and after opening.

<doc id="48558" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48558" title="Alexander Pushkin">
Alexander Pushkin

Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin (born May 26 (June 6, New Style) 1799, Moscow; died January 29 (February 10 New Style), St Petersburg) was a Russian poet, novelist, dramatist and writer of short stories. People think he was the greatest Russian poet. He started the great tradition of Russian literature. Pushkin wrote in a way that no other Russian had done: he used the Russian language in the way it was spoken instead of writing in a style based on old church books. His influence on other Russian writers was enormous and many Russian composers set his stories and poems to music. Fewer people outside Russia read Pushkin's poems. This is because his poetry is very hard to translate well into other languages because the words are full of special meanings in Russian culture. Pushkin was killed in a duel in 1837 at the age of 37. 

Pushkin's father came from an old aristocratic family. On his mother's side Pushkin had African ancestors. His great-grandfather Abram Gannibal was an Abyssinian who was living in a palace of the Turkish sultan in Istanbul. The Russian ambassador bought him as a present for Peter the Great, the tsar of Russia. Gannibal became a favourite of Peter the Great and he was sent to Paris to study. He became very rich. Pushkin was proud of his great-grandfather and wrote about him in a novel called "The Negro of Peter the Great".

In 19th century Russia all aristocratic families learned to speak French, so Pushkin and his brother and sister spoke and wrote in French more than in Russian. The children were cared for by a nurse, Arina Rodionovna Yakovleva. It was the nurse who taught them to love the Russian language. She told the children Russian folktales. Pushkin also spoke Russian to the peasants and he read many books in his father's library.

When he was 12 he went to a new school called the Imperial Lyceum at Tsarskoye Selo. Years later this school was renamed Pushkin after their famous pupil. He soon started writing romantic poems in Russian using Russian tales of heroes and adventures. "Ruslan and Ludmila" was a poem that was later to be made into an opera by Mikhael Glinka.

In 1817, Pushkin got a job in the foreign office at St. Petersburg. He soon became interested in politics and supported the Decembrist revolt of 1825 when a group of noblemen and army officers tried to put another tsar in power and make him less powerful. Pushkin wrote some political poems. The result was that he was told he had to leave St. Petersburg. He had to spend six years in exile in the south of the country: in the Caucasus and the Crimea. He wrote about his experiences in the south in several romantic narrative poems (long poems which tell a story). He started work on a novel in verse called "Yevgeny Onegin" (or "Eugene Onegin"). He did not finish it until 1833. This was to be his most famous work. It was used by many musicians including Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky who made it into an opera. The poem shows typical Russian people in the society of his day. 

Pushkin was angry that he was still in exile and he wrote many letters to his friends. Many of these letters were later published. He spent a lot of time drinking, gaming and fighting with swords. He fell in love with the daughter of a Count for whom he was working. The Count managed to get Pushkin exiled to his mother's estate near Pskov at the other end of Russia. Pushkin spent two years here. He was lonely, but he studied Russian history and talked to the peasants. The poems he wrote were full of ideas from Russian culture. He wrote one of his major works: "Boris Godunov", a drama about a story from Russian history. The composer Modest Mussorgsky later made an opera from it. Boris Godunov was a cruel tsar in the 17th century. Pushkin's play shows that the ordinary people had a lot of power. This made it difficult for Pushkin to get it published.

After the revolt in 1825 the new tsar Nicholas I realized that Pushkin was by now very famous. He also realized that he had not taken part in the revolt, so he allowed him to return. The tsar said that he himself would censor Pushkin's works before they were allowed to be published. He said that he was going to be a good tsar and help the poor people (the serfs) to become free. Pushkin was in a difficult position because he could not write anything that the tsar would not like.

He had to be very careful not to say bad things about the rulers of the country. The police watched him very carefully. Yet at this time Pushkin wrote a large number of great works, almost each one of them being the first of their kind in Russian literature. One example is the short story "The Queen of Spades", which Tchaikovsky made into an opera and which was to be a great influence on the novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky.

In his last years, Pushkin was again in government service in St. Petersburg. He married in 1831 and had to spend a lot of time in society at court. He wrote more and more prose. He wrote a history of Peter the Great and a historical novel "The Captain's Daughter". He kept asking the tsar to let him resign from his job and go to the country to spend his time writing. The tsar would not allow that. In 1837, Pushkin was killed in a duel. He had been forced to fight the duel in order to defend his wife's honour.

The Russian language today would be very different if it had not been for Pushkin. Using the language as it was spoken by the people he made it into a language which was simple but which could also express deep feelings. His works were a great influence on later writers like Ivan Turgenev, Ivan Goncharov and Leo Tolstoy. "Yevgeny Onegin" was the first Russian novel which told a story about the society of the time. His works have been translated into all the major languages

Exile

Exile means being sent away from the country or area where you live. People are usually exiled for political reasons or sometimes because they have committed a crime. They may have said bad things about the rulers in that country or tried to get into power themselves. People are not exiled in democratic countries, but many famous people in history have been sent into exile.

Exile may mean that someone is sent out of the country, but sometimes they are sent to another part of the country (this is called "internal exile"). Sometimes people have made their own decision to leave their country as a protest against the way it was being ruled. This is called "self-imposed exile".

In the Old Testament the Jews were exiled to Babylon. In Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome people were often sent into exile. For several centuries Russia (in the 20th century the Soviet Union) sent many people into exile, often to labour camps in Siberia. Thousands of people from Europe including many famous people went to the United States when the Nazis came to power in Germany in the 1930s.

One famous person who was sent into exile was Napoléon Bonaparte who was exiled from France, first to Elba and then to St Helena.

The cellist Pablo Casals went into self-imposed exile as a protest against the government of Spain. He said he would not come back until Spain was a democracy.

Flagellum

A flagellum (plural: "flagella") is a long, whip-like projection of a cell composed of microtubules. They help propel cells and organisms in a whip-like motion. The flagellum of eukaryotes usually moves with an “S” motion, and is surrounded by cell membrane.

Flagella are structurally almost identical with the much smaller Cilia. So much so that it has been proposed protists bearing either should be unified in the Phylum "Undulipodia". Previously, Margulis had proposed that the Ciliates alone should be placed in a Phylum "Ciliophora". Admittedly, the Protista is a collection of disparate single-celled forms, but while a more sophisticated taxonomy is in flux (changing), Protista is still a useful term.

Cilia and flagella are cell organelles, specialised units which carry out well-defined functions, like mitochondria and plastids. It is fairly clear now that all or most of these organelles have their origin in once-independent prokaryotes (bacteria or archaea), and that the eukaryote cell is a 'community of micro-organisms' working together in 'a marriage of convenience'.

Three types of flagella have so far been distinguished; bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic. The main differences among these three types are summarized below:

Walkman is the invention as well as the brand name of Sony. It represents a portable audio player. Today, similar devices are also called "Walkman". The name describes players that have small sizes and can be carried by one anywhere. The portable player was a revolutionary device since one could take favorite music with him or her.

The year of release of the original Walkman is 1979. The name "Walkman" was used in Japan, while abroad it had other names, one of which was "Soundabout". First the product did not have a name, and then one of the company's staff proposed "Walkman". Because it was a direct translation from Japanese, Sony's leadership seemed skeptical. They thought "Walkman" was not a suitable name for a device which was to be launched in the United States and Europe.

Sony used new ways to introduce its new product on the market and advertise it. The main idea of Sony was to make people aware that Walkman is a product that is unique on the market and that it is both new and fun. 

On June 22 (the date of release) Sony Walkman appeared in Tokyo. The company held an unusual press conference where different journalists were invited to Yoyogi, which is Tokyo's major park. They were given Walkman so to prove that the portable player is fun and easy to use. By 1995 there were already about 150 million Walkman portable players produced.

MPEG-4 is a video and audio standard. Movies in MPEG-4 need less space on a computer and at the same time they have DVD quality. MPEG means Moving Picture Experts Group. Hundreds of researchers and engineers all over the world worked to develop MPEG-4. The work on this standard ended in 1998 and in a few months MPEG-4 was made into a standard all over the world.

Movies that use MPEG-4 standard have high quality and have take up less computer room. Older standards were MPEG-1 and MPEG-2. In comparison with these older versions, MPEG-4 has additional features like having a way to fix problems, lots of quality and size choices, good picture and many more.

MPEG-4 takes into consideration special needs from computer, television areas and telecommunication. It is able to be, besides rectangular pieces of computer information, individual objects in a certain area. An example could be a car driving in front of a background. The background does not change. Since MPEG-4 can be many rectangular images, the car can be treated as another thing, not being a fixed background.

Lewis first became famous as part of a , Martin & Lewis, with singer Dean Martin. They worked together for ten years, appearing onstage, on radio and television, and in movies. They parted ways during 1956. They did not speak for years, but reunited a few times from the 1970s to the 1990s.

Besides his acting career, Lewis was also the director of many of his movies. He was the first director to use video cameras alongside movie cameras, to help with filming scenes. While film takes time to be developed, videotape could be played back instantly, saving time and work if a scene needed to be redone. Other directors soon adopted his technique, and it is still used today.

During the 1970s, Lewis' movies became less popular, and he moved away from acting and directing. In the 1990s, he returned to performing onstage, and continued to perform during the 2000s.

There are categories in breakdances. They are power moves, toprock, ground rock, foot work, and freezes. Many of moves come from gymnastics and kung-fu, and once or twice have support actions that are almost balletic.

Lysergic acid diethylamide

LSD is the shorter name for a drug called Lysergic acid diethylamide. LSD is often called by the slang name acid. LSD is a psychedelic drug which causes people who take it to witness illusions. It also alters their thought processes.

LSD is sometimes used for certain therapies. Most often, it is not taken as a medicine. Instead, it is used as an illegal drug.

LSD is made in a laboratory by chemists. It was invented in 1938 by a Swiss chemist named Dr. Albert Hofmann at the Sandoz Laboratories in Switzerland. Dr. Hofmann was trying to find new drugs, including one against the common cold.

One day in 1943, Hofmann accidentally a small amount of LSD, and noticed strange light patterns in the sky as he went home. He believed that what he had experienced were the effects of the drug. He tried a larger amount next. He ended up with a much stronger reaction to the drug than he expected. Hofmann lay on a couch, afraid he had made himself insane for life. When a neighbor came, found him in trouble, and stayed to look after Hofmann, he was able to calm down, and even said he began to enjoy the plays of colorful shapes and patterns that occurred behind his closed eyes. The next day Hofmann reported to have waken up refreshed and clear-headed, though somewhat physically tired. He also noted that his breakfast tasted unusually delicious that morning.

Sandoz began to offer LSD to doctors and . Sandoz saw it as a help to doctors and therapists so they could get a chance to gain insight into how someone who was mentally ill might see the world. It is known today, that the effects of LSD are very different from those of delusional mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia. For their patients, it was a chance to uncover hidden feelings and thoughts, which could be dealt with in therapy. LSD showed promise in the treatment of problems like alcoholism. Some alcoholics who tried the drug found their need to drink alcohol lessened or went away. They understood better why they had abused alcohol. Unlike other drugs, the for alcohol was not replaced by a craving for LSD. The study showed a 50% success rate, compared to 10% for "cold turkey" methods.

In the United States, the Central Intelligence Agency tested the drug on subjects for different reasons. The name for one of these test projects was MK-ULTRA. Subjects did not know they were given the drug. It was used in to see if it would make people tell the truth, or remember things they had forgotten. It was also used to convince people they were becoming insane, or that things had happened which really had not, such as an invasion from outer space, or a Communist takeover of the country, or that their bodies were in some way. The CIA supposedly felt it was important to learn how ordinary citizens might react to such things if they happened. The drug sometimes made the scenarios more believable. The effects of these experiments were often harmful to the subjects, even years later, because of the intense anxiety or fear caused when someone unknowingly takes a drug like LSD.

LSD first became popular in the 1960s. A Harvard psychology professor called Dr. Timothy Leary began to encourage people to try the drug then. College students willingly took part in LSD experiments. These experiments were made by psychologists and other professionals. Leary and two of the people he worked with, Richard Alpert and Ralph Metzner, thought the transforming effects of the drug could be a kind of of users, in the same way as many religions offered them. They wrote a book, "The Psychedelic Experience", which was based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Leary eventually became well known in the 1960s hippie movement for his about LSD: "Turn on, tune in, drop out". The Hippies were a countercultural movement. A number of famous rock bands, including the Beatles and the Grateful Dead, became known for their use of LSD, and even a new type of rock music, called "acid rock", was born from the fad.

LSD quickly became a popular drug outside of the medical profession. Many people began using or giving LSD out casually. "Acid parties" and "acid tests" became a social . The drug would sometimes be slipped to persons unknowingly, often through "spiked" punch or drinks. Some problems developed, as some casual users began to experience , such as "flashbacks" and psychotic symptoms, though both of these are rare. Sometimes signs of depression and were seen. Due to the spread of LSD use outside of the medical community, the United States government banned LSD (made it against the law to make, have or use) in 1967. Other countries soon followed.

The most common danger of taking LSD is having a bad experience, which is called a "bad trip." During a bad trip, people may feel very scared and worried, and they may have very sad thoughts. A bad trip can lead to lasting bad memories and even mental harm. Users who get out of control, or who try to harm themselves, should be taken for medical help.

Many illegal drugs, such as heroin and cocaine, are very addictive. This means that people who start taking the drug will want to keep taking it, even if it is damaging their physical and mental health. LSD is not addictive to the body or to the mind.

Another danger from using LSD is that it makes a person impaired (intoxicated). When people are impaired, they may have accidents or do things that they would not normally do. In some rare cases, people taking LSD develop a psychosis.

Frequent or regular use of LSD can result in . In a flashback, the person feels the drug beginning to affect him or her again, even though he or she has not taken a dose that day. This can be brought on by stress. Note that over 75% of LSD users claimed never to have "flashed back".

It has been said that some people who use LSD can end up with damage to their chromosomes, but this is a myth based on one wrong report that was disproved soon after it was published.

LSD is illegal in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom and most of Europe. Some countries enforce the laws against LSD very harshly. Other countries do not enforce the law very much. LSD has been manufactured illegally since the 1960s.

Final Fantasy VII is a fantasy role-playing video game for the Playstation. It was released in 1997 by Square Co., Ltd. (now Square Enix).

The main characters you can play as in Final Fantasy VII are Cloud Strife, Aeris Gainsborough, Barret Wallace, Tifa Lockhart, Red XIII/Nanaki, Cait Sith, Cid Highwind, and two secret characters: Vincent Valentine and Yuffie Kisaragi. Sephiroth joins the party in a series of flashbacks, but he cannot be controlled or equipped. However, his status, inventory and equipment, can be checked during Cloud's flashback. 

Important characters in Shin-Ra are Reeve (Head of Urban Development), Hojo (Head of the Science Department), Palmer (Head of Space Exploration), Heidegger (Head of the Peace Preservation Department), Scarlet (Head of Weapons Research and Development), President Shinra, his son Rufus, and members of a secret police organization called the Turks (Elena, Rude, Reno, and Tseng). 

In the original English language release of Final Fantasy VII, Aerith's name was spelled wrong after being translated, as 'Aeris'. Games that came after that had Aeris as a character, like Kingdom Hearts, spelled it right. Although the spelling 'Aeris' is what some people would call wrong, the pronunciation is right, as the letters 'th' in Japanese are pronounced like an English 's'.

The soundtrack for the game was made by Nobuo Uematsu. Music from the game has been released on an original four-disc soundtrack, a single disc album of some arranged tracks titled Final Fantasy VII Reunion Tracks, and piano-only arrangement of some tracks. Popular pieces from the them include Aerith's Theme, a quiet and melodic character theme, and One-Winged Angel, the first composition for the Final Fantasy series to have recorded voices. The game's main theme, heard on the world map in Disc 1, is over 6 minutes long.

Fritjof Capra

Fritjof Capra (born February 1, 1939) is an Austrian-born American physicist.

Born in Vienna, Austria, Capra earned a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Vienna in 1966. He has done research on particle physics and systems theory, and has written popular books on the implications of science with ethycs, metaphysics and society.
In particular in "The Tao of Physics" he makes the assertion that physics and metaphysics are both inexorably leading to the same knowledge. His works all share a similar subtext: that ""there are hidden connections between everything"". Capra is both a Buddhist and a Catholic Christian. 

After touring Germany in the early 1980s, Capra co-wrote a book on Green Politics with ecofeminist author Charlene Spretnak called "Green Politics," in 1984.

Capra pushes for western society to abandon conventional linear thought and the mechanistic views of Descartes. Critiquing Descartes' reductionistic view that everything can be studied in parts to understand the whole, he allows his readers to take an objective and fresh mind, encouraging them to see the world through complexity theory.

Capra is purportedly setting the grounds for change in many new theories, one of which is the theory of living systems, a theoretical framework for ecology. This theory is only now fully emerging but it has its roots in several scientific fields that were developed during the first half of the twentieth century — organismic biology, gestalt psychology, ecology, general systems theory, and cybernetics.

Minor Threat was hardcore punk band from Washington DC from the 1980s. Many other bands which played hardcore punk music in the United States were influenced by Minor Threat's music. Minor Threat's songs were usually short and fast. All of Minor Threat's records were released on the band's own Dischord Records label.

Minor Threat told their listeners they did not use illegal drugs or drink alcohol, which was called being "straight edge." 

Ian MacKaye, Jeff Nelson, bassist Brian Baker, and guitarist Lyle Preslar formed Minor Threat in 1980. Their first records were "Minor Threat" and "In My Eyes" in 1981. The group toured through the United States.
Their song "Straight Edge" had lyrics (words) that told people they did not use illegal drugs or drink alcohol, which was called being "straight edge." Another song called "Out of Step" tells listeners not to smoke, drink, or have casual sex. People often thought that the band was telling others not to do these things but in interviews the band states that straight edge is a personal decision.

Minor Threat broke up in 1983.

The Elizabethan Religious Settlement was Elizabeth I’s answer to the religious quarrels that developed during the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI and Mary I. 

This answer was given in two Acts of the Parliament of England. The Act of Supremacy of 1559 confirmed the English church’s independence from Rome. The Act of Uniformity 1559 decided about the form of the English church.

Often it was seen as the end of the English Reformation and the foundation of Anglicanism. But some historians think that England did not become a Protestant nation on a popular level for a long time since then. There seem to have been great divisions in the population and among the clergy for a long time afterwards.

Unlike most lizards, geckos have voices. A gecko sounds a little like a bird or a frog. In some languages these lizards have names that sound like their calls, for example, both English and Indonesian call one kind gecko (gek KO) and tokay (to-KAY). Another kind of gecko, with a different sound, is called chicak (CHEE chak).

Geckos have no eyelids. Instead, they have a clear membrane (skin) over their eyes. They lick the membrane clean with their tongues. Like most lizards, they can regenerate their tail if they need to.

Many kinds of geckos can walk on walls, windows and ceilings. They can do this because they have special toe pads. A microscope can show that each toe pad is made of thousands of hair-like structures. Each of these structures branches into many smaller ends.

Rutherfordium

Rutherfordium is a chemical element. It has also been named eka-hafnium and unnilquadium. It has the symbol Rf. It has the atomic number 104. It is a very radioactive element that does not exist in nature. It has to be made. Rutherfordium is the first transactinide element.. The isotope that has the longest half-life is Rf. Rutherfordium-265 only has a half life of about 13 hours.

The amount of rutherfordium that has been made is not enough to give much information about it. The element has no present uses. It is thought that the chemistry of rutherfordium will be like the chemistry of hafnium.

Rutherfordium was named after Ernest Rutherford. It was reported that it was first made in 1964 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna, Russia. The scientists reported that they bombarded a different chemical element Pu with the element Ne. The neon-22 particles were accelerated to an energy of 113 to 115 MeV. They claim they detected nuclear fission tracks in a special type of glass with a microscope showing that a new element was there.

In 1969 scientists at the University of California, Berkeley made rutherfordium by banging together Cf and C at very high energies. These scientists said that when they tried to make rutherfordium in the same way as the scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research none of the element was produced.

The scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research claimed that it was first detected in Dubna. They thought it should be named "dubnium" ("Db") or "kurchatovium" ("Ku") for Igor Vasilevich Kurchatov (1903-1960).

The scientists at the University of California, Berkeley thought it should be named "rutherfordium" ("Rf").

The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) decide the name of elements that should be used by everyone. They used "unnilquadium" ("Unq") as a temporary name. Unnilquadium is the systematic element name. In 1997 they resolved the dispute and used the current name of rutherfordium. The chemical element with atomic number 105 was named dubnium.

There are about 3,800 species, which live all over the world, except in cold climates. One type, the marine iguana, lives in the sea. Size varies greatly, ranging from 5 inches to the Komodo dragon's 9 feet and 150 pounds. 
Some kinds of lizard are:
Suborder Lacertilia (Sauria) 

In the traditional taxonomy the Order Squamata is divided as follows:

A modern view is that the snakes and lizards are all infraorders of the Squamata: 

There are other versions, and the taxonomy will probably not settle until more molecular evidence is collected.

The skull structure of both snakes and lizards is distinctive. They can move their upper jaw relative to the braincase. They bear horny scales, and many use venom for attack and deefence.

The Squamates are definitely a monophyletic group; they are a sister group to the Tuatara. Judged by their fossil record, the Squamates were present in the Mesozoic, but occupied a minor place in the land ecology. Three of the six lines are recorded first in the Upper Jurassic, the others in the Cretaceous. Probably all (including snakes) arose earlier in the Jurassic. The Mosasaurs of the Upper Cretaceous were by far the most successful of all the lizards, becoming the top predator in their ecosystem.

Sight is very important for most lizards, both for locating prey and for communication. Many lizards have highly acute color vision. Most lizards rely heavily on body language, using specific postures, gestures and movements to define territory, resolve disputes, and entice mates. Some species of lizard also utilize bright colors, such as the iridescent patches on the belly of Sceloporus. These colors would be highly visible to predators, so are often hidden on the underside or between scales and only revealed when necessary.

The "dewlap" is a brightly colored patch of skin on the throat, usually hidden between scales. When a display is needed, the lizards erect the hyoid bone of their throat, resulting in a large vertical flap of brightly colored skin beneath the head which can be then used for communication.

Miles per hour

Miles per hour is a unit of measurement. It measures speed. It is the number of miles moved in an hour.

Miles per hour is the unit used for speed limits on roads in the United Kingdom and the United States. It is normally abbreviated in everyday use to mph or MPH. In technical publications mi/h is sometimes as the abbreviation.

The SI unit for velocity (speed, with a direction of movement) is m·s (metres per second).

Nobility

Nobility was the highest social class in pre-modern societies. In the feudal system (in Europe and elsewhere), the nobility were mostly those who had got land from the monarch and had to give services to him, mainly military service.

It soon became a hereditary class, sometimes with a right to bear a hereditary title and to have financial and other privileges. 

Today, in most countries, "noble status" means no legal privileges; an important exception is the United Kingdom, where certain titles (titles of the peerage, until recently guaranteed a seat in the Upper House of Westminster Parliament, that is why it is called House of Lords), and still means some less important privileges.

Trio (music)

A trio is a group of three people who are playing musical instruments or singing together. The word "trio" may also refer to the piece of music that they are playing.

Three people who are singing together are a "vocal trio".

Classical composers writing chamber music very often wrote trios. Usually the trio is called after the main instrument in the group. A piano trio is normally a piece for piano, violin and cello. A string trio is a piece for three string instruments, usually violin, viola and cello. 

Many other combinations are possible. Brahms wrote a piece which is normally referred to as a "Horn Trio" for french horn, violin and piano. Mozart wrote a piece normally called a "Clarinet Trio" which is for clarinet, viola and piano.

A piece for three people sitting at one piano is usually called a piece for "piano 6 hands".

Trios can also apply to popular music, like Nickel Creek.

Learning music by ear

Learning music by ear is learning to play a piece of music by listening to other people playing it and then trying to play it oneself. In some musical traditions there is no written music and everybody plays by ear all the time. Folk music is traditionally learned by listening to other musicians and copying them. This is how music is passed from one generation to another.

Most people in the Western musical tradition learn pieces and songs by reading music, but it is good to try to play music by ear sometimes. It can be a very useful skill.

The Suzuki method of learning instruments started in Japan but is now used in many countries. It teaches young children to play an instrument (usually the violin) by ear.

"We knew the world would not be the same", he recalled the moments after the successful testing of the atomic bomb in New Mexico, United States years later. "A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, 'I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that one way or another." The quote from the Hindu scripture had since become one of Oppenheimer's most famous quotes. He died of throat cancer in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.

Minor league baseball

Minor league baseball is a level of professional baseball in North America. It is made up a many different teams which play in many leagues and levels of ability. Minor league teams are used by Major League teams to have a place to put their players who they do not feel are good enough to play in the Major League yet. 

There are several different levels of ability in the Minor Leagues, these levels are (in order from lowest to highest): 

Once a player has shown he is good enough to play in one level of the minor leagues, he is usually moved up to a higher, more difficult level, until he is finally able to play in the Major Leagues. This way players are able to get better at baseball before having to play against tougher opponents. Almost all players in the Major Leagues had to play in the minor leagues first in order to become good enough to play in the Major Leagues.

Sometimes, Major League players who are have been hurt will play a few games in the minor leagues before playing in the Major Leagues again, in order to see if they feel good enough to start playing again.

There are also other professional baseball leagues that Major League teams do not use to as a place put their players. These are known as "Independent Leagues". In these leagues players do not go to higher or lower levels of ability.

American League

The American League (or AL) is one of the two leagues that make up Major League Baseball. The other is the National League (or NL). The American League is made up of 14 teams. At the end of each season, four of these teams go to the "post-season" where one will win the American League championship. The champions of the American League plays against the champions of the National League in the World Series. The team that wins the World Series is the champion of Major League Baseball. 

The only big differences between the American League and the National League is the number of teams (the National League has 16 teams) and that the American League uses the "Designated Hitter" (or DH). The Designated Hitter is a player who does not play in the field, but is used to bat for the worst hitter in his team's "lineup" (usually the pitcher). The National League does not use the Designated Hitter, and all players in the "lineup" must bat and field for themselves.

Statistical survey

Statistical surveys are collections of information about items in a population. 
Surveys can be grouped into numerical and categorical types. A numerical survey is to get numbers as replies. For example:

How many minutes, on average, do you spend eating breakfast?
This survey question is used to generate numbers in minutes. An example of a categorical question is:
What is your favorite color?
The categories for this would be yellow, green, purple, etc... which are not numbers.

Surveys of human populations and institutions are common in political polling and government, health, social science and marketing research. A survey may concentrate on opinions or factual information depending on its purpose.

The social sciences are a group of academic disciplines that study human aspects of the world. Social Sciences includes anthropology, archaeology, economics, geography, political science, psychology, and sociology. They are different from the arts and humanities as for them scientific method is important. Most of the social sciences require doing a lot of research, such as making surveys. Such research is called "social research". Some subjects, such as history, are sometimes social sciences and sometimes humanties. 

The term "social sciences" has been used for over 200 years and mostly originates from a thinker named Auguste Comte. Many of the fields of social science have come about since then. In America, much of the thought and practice of social science came from the University of Chicago and other universities.

Chief executive officer

A Chief Executive Officer (CEO), or Chief Executive, is the highest-ranking corporate officer, administrator, corporate administrator, executive, or executive officer, in charge of total management of a corporation, company, organization or agency. 

In closely held corporations, it is general business culture that the office of Chief Executive Officer, CEO, is also the chairman of the board. Specifically, one person often shares the chairman and CEO titles while another person takes the presidency or may become chief operating officer (COO). However, the term president is from the U.S. and in the UK COO is favored. Underneath that comes the Executive Vice President (U.S.) or Executive Director (UK). In publicly held corporations, the CEO and chairman positions can be separated but there are implications in corporate governance by doing so.

In some European Union countries, there are two separate boards, one executive board for the day-to-day business and one supervisory board for control purposes (elected by the shareholders). In these countries, the chief executive officer presides over the executive board and the chairman presides over the supervisory board and these two roles will always be held by different people. This ensures a distinction between management by the executive board and governance by the supervisory board. This allows for clear lines of authority. The aim is to prevent a conflict of interest and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person. There is a strong parallel here with the structure of governments, which tend to separate the political cabinet from the management civil service.

In rare circumstances an Executive Chairperson can be appointed but this is either illegal in many jurisdictions or frowned upon by Regulators.

In the United Kingdom many Charities and Government Agencies are headed by a Chief Executive who is answerable to a Board of Trustees or Board of Directors. In the UK, the Chairman (of the Board) in public companies is more senior than the Chief Executive. Most public companies now split the role of Chairman and Chief Executive.

Typically, a CEO has a cadre of subordinate executives, each of which has specific functional responsibilities. These direct reporting relationships most often include: Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, and Chief Information Officer. Although not an Executive, the Director of Human Resources plays a vital role within any corporation.

However, depending on the industry in which the company operates and/or the organizational structure the company has employed, various other functional areas may be highlighted through the CEO's direct span of control. Some of these less common monikers include: Chief (Business) Development Officer, Chief Knowledge Officer/Chief Learning Officer, Chief Strategy Officer, Chief Risk Officer, and Chief Credit Officer.

According to Don Schmincke, to be a strong executive, "one cannot act in business differently from how he acts in family life or society". Meaning being a successful executive requires a man’s conduct to be “correct in all points”, his actions must follow his words at all times.

Amateur radio is a hobby for people who like to talk using radio transmitters. Many people enjoy using amateur radio to talk to other amateur radio hobbyists in other countries. Amateur radio hobbyists also use their radio transmitters to get help in emergencies. Amateur radio is often called "Ham Radio". Many people use their amateur radios for fun. People who use Amateur radio are often called "amateur radio operators", "hams" or "amateurs".

During a disaster or emergency, Amateur radio can be used to get help. When telephones do not work, it may be the only way to communicate with people. Amateur radio hobbyists also use their radio transmitters to get help in emergencies. Some amateur radio hobbyists volunteer to listen to the emergency band frequencies in case there are distress calls. If the volunteers hear a distress call, they notify the appropriate authorities (for example the police or the Coast Guard).

People must have a license to use Amateur radio. In most countries users must pass a test to get a license. In some countries there is more than one license grade. In some countries, people can use Amateur radio if they have a license from their home country.

There are many clubs for Amateur radio in many countries. These clubs do many things as a group and help people get their Amateur radio license.

Amateur radio operators talk to each other in many ways. Some people talk with their voice, others use computers, television, or Morse code. They use many ways to get their signals to others. They can bounce their signals off the sky, the moon or a satellite. Amateur radio operators have many ways to talk using the radio. Amateur radio satellites are called OSCAR's - Orbital Satellites Carrying Amateur Radio. Hams can also talk to astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS).

There are many ways to have fun with amateur radio. There are many games and contests. Amateur radio operators try to talk with as many others as possible. They then mail each other postcards called "QSL cards" to confirm the contact. Contesters may try to see how far they can talk, or to how many different people they can talk.

Some hide a transmitter which sends out a signal and others try to find it using receivers. This is called "Radio direction finding", "fox hunting" or "Radio sport". Sometimes the event is done with cars, or as a foot race.

Amateur radio is practised by over 15,000 licensed users in India. The first amateur radio operator was licensed in 1921. By the mid 1930s, there were around 20 amateur radio operators in India. Amateur radio operators have played an important part in the Indian independence movement with the setting up of pro-independence radio stations in the 1940s.

Merchant

Merchants deal with trade. That means they deal goods that they do not produce themselves, in order to get profit.

Merchants can be into two types:


In the US, "merchant" is any person while engaged in a business or profession or a seller who deals regularly in the type of goods sold. Under the common law in the United States, merchants are held to a higher standard in the selling of products than those who are not engaged in the sale of goods as a profession. For example, when a merchant sells something, he or she is expected to give a warranty, guaranteeing that the product is fit to be sold, even if there is nothing in writing to this effect.

<doc id="48820" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48820" title="Warranty">
Warranty

In commercial and consumer transactions, a warranty is an obligation that an article or service that is sold has the quality the buyer can reasonably expect from the seller.

That often means that there must be a remedy. That means repair or replacement if the article or service is not as good as the warranty says. It is a breach of the warranty when the promise is broken, i.e., a product is defective or not as good as should be expected by a reasonable buyer.

In business and legal transactions, a warranty is an assurance by one party to the other party that certain facts or conditions are true or will happen. The other party is allowed to rely on that assurance and seek some type of remedy if it is not true or followed.

A warranty may be express or implied.

An express warranty is typically a guarantee from the seller of a product that specifies the extent to which the quality or performance of the product is assured and states the conditions under which the product can be returned, replaced, or repaired. 

An implied warranty is one that arises from the nature of the transaction, and the understanding by the buyer.
To be "merchantable", the goods must reasonably conform to an ordinary buyer's expectations, i.e., they are what they say they are. For example, a fruit that looks and smells good but has hidden defects would violate the implied warranty of merchantability if its quality does not meet the standards for such fruit "as passes ordinarily in the trade". 

A warranty is violated when the promise is broken; when goods are not as should be expected, at the time the sale occurs, whether or not the defect is apparent. Most warranties exclude parts that normally wear out, and supplies that must be periodically replaced as they are normally used up (e.g., tires and lubrication on a vehicle). 

Many people do not realize that extended warranties are not always provided through the manufacturer, but in some circumstances it may work to the consumer's benefit. For instance, when an auto warranty is provided through a dealership from the manufacturer, repairs on the vehicle are reimbursed at a lower negotiated rate.

In the United States, the rights and remedies of buyers and sellers of goods are governed by the Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) as it has been adopted with variations from state to state. 

A car warranty is at least one year. Three years is more common. Five years is an extended warranty.

A home warranty protects against the high costs of home and appliance repair by offering insurance coverage for appliances and equipment in the house.

Giuseppe Verdi

Giuseppe Verdi (b. Roncole near Busseto, 9 or 10 October 1813; died Milan 27 January 1901) was an Italian composer of operas. Verdi and Richard Wagner were the greatest composers of opera in the 19th century although they were completely different from one another. When Verdi was a young man the most famous opera composers in Italy were Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini who wrote in the bel canto tradition. This meant that their operas had beautiful tunes which were written for singers to show off their voices, even if what they sang did not suit the story. During his long life Verdi changed opera so that it did not have to obey old-fashioned rules. He made the drama the most important thing and the music is there to help the drama.

The small village where Verdi was born lies in the valley of the river Po in the north of Italy. It was a poor district. His father was an innkeeper who had a small farm. The young boy must have been very talented. He was given a spinet which he kept all his life. At the age of 9 he often played the organ for church services in the village when the organist was away.

A few years later he composed music for the amateur orchestra in Busseto. A man called Antonio Barezzi knew many important people and he helped Verdi a lot. Later Verdi married his daughter. Barezzi sent him to Milan so that he could study, but Verdi had not been taught the piano properly and he did not get a place in the music conservatory. He had some private lessons and learned a lot about opera as well as about literature and politics. In 1839 he composed an opera: "Oberto, conte di San Bonifacio", which was performed in La Scala, the world-famous opera house in Milan. It is not one of his greatest operas, but it helped him to become well-known and he was asked to write three more operas for La Scala. When his next opera was produced it was not a success: the audience did not like it and they hissed and booed. There was also tragedy in his personal life at this time: his two children and his wife all died.

Verdi managed to overcome his unhappiness in 1842 when he produced his opera "Nabucco". This was a great success and made him world-famous. He started to work very hard, composing two operas a year. He not only had to write the music but organize all the people to perform it. It was a huge workload. His opera "Ernani" (1844) was one of the best from this period. In 1847 he had another big success with "Macbeth". This opera, based on Shakespeare’s famous play, is still one of the best-loved of all operas. He was becoming more amazing.

For centuries Italy had been a collection of several countries, each with their own ruler. In the 1850s there was a lot of political unrest in the country. Verdi often wrote music for large choruses in his operas. The words of these choruses were often about fighting for freedom, and it was often thought that the songs were encouraging people to revolt. The song "Va pensiero" from his opera "Nabucco" was about the Hebrew slaves who were captive in Babylon. People chanted it in the streets with the words suitably changed. Verdi became a great national hero. Italy eventually became one country in 1861.

Giuseppina Strepponi was the soprano who sang the part of Abigaille in "Nabucco". Verdi fell in love with her. She had lived with another man and had three children so she felt that she was not good enough for Verdi. They eventually married in 1859. She was a great support to him until her death in 1897 although Verdi was not an easy husband to live with. He moved back to Busseto with her. He continued to travel a lot but did not let his wife come with him, leaving her behind in Busseto where she was not happy because many people there did not like her.

Three more famous operas were written at this time: "Rigoletto" in 1851 and "Il trovatore" ("The Troubadour") and "La traviata", both in 1853. These operas have many tunes which became famous. They are full of exciting drama in which the characters are very skilfully described by the music. The music is not divided so clearly into recitative and aria like it had been for two centuries. Instead, the music is developing all the time, the arias run straight into the following music. He had a brilliant sense of drama, but he often had to fight hard to stop producers making changes to what he had written.

Verdi often had trouble with the censors (the officials who decide whether the opera should be allowed to be performed). His opera "Rigoletto" was based on a story called "Le roi s’amuse" by Victor Hugo. The attempted murder of a king was not thought to be a suitable subject. Verdi had to change the king into a duke in his story and make some other changes before the opera could be performed. The story of his opera "Traviata", based on a novel by Alexandre Dumas fils, was also thought to be immoral. At the first performance the audience laughed because the heroine, who is supposed to be dying of consumption, was very fat. However, the opera soon became enormously popular.

Verdi had become very famous by now, and was asked to compose for the Opéra in Paris. He had to write operas in the French style: operas with five acts and a ballet based on a serious story. None of the operas he wrote at this time for Paris belong to his best works. He was more inspired when writing for the Italian theatres. "Simon Boccanegra" has a very complicated plot, but the characters are described beautifully by the music. "Un ballo in maschera" (The masked ball) was about the murder of King Gustav III of Sweden. Again the censors did not like it and he had to change the story to a setting in Boston which rather spoiled the story. In the 1860s his best works were "La Forza del Destino" ("The Force of Destiny"), written for St Petersburg, "Don Carlos" written for the Paris Opéra, and "Aida" for the new opera house in Cairo in Egypt. "Aida" is considered one of his most perfect works. The first performance was not without difficulties: Verdi was having a long argument with the conductor Mariani who refused to go to Cairo to conduct it. The argument was made worse by the newspapers who accused Verdi of taking Mariani’s girlfriend. This caused a great scandal.

Verdi retired in the 1870s. He was a rich man who owned a lot of land. He gave a lot of money to charities, particularly to one charity for elderly musicians. Even in retirement he was persuaded by his publishers to write two more operas. He became fascinated by Shakespeare and he wrote "Otello" to a libretto (words) by Arrigo Boito. This was a brilliant libretto and it helped him to write a great masterpiece in which every little detail of the story is beautifully described by the music. His very last opera, "Falstaff" (1893) is based on Shakespeare’s "Merry Wives of Windsor". Verdi continued to write a few religious pieces in his old age. He died in 1901.

Stainless steel

Stainless steel, also known as inox steel, is a steel alloy with a minimum of 10.5 or 11% chromium content by mass. 

Stainless steel does not stain, corrode, or rust as easily as ordinary steel, but it is not stain-proof.

The term 'corrosion resistant steel' is used when the alloy has less than the 12% minimum of chromium, for example in the aviation industry. There are different grades and surface finishes of stainless steel, depending on where it will used. Stainless steels have a higher resistance to oxidation (rust) and corrosion in many natural and man-made environments; however, it is important to select the correct type of stainless steel for the use. There are over 150 grades of stainless steel, of which fifteen are the most used. 

The idea behind stainless steel was discovered in the first part of the 19th century, but it took about 80 years to develop a reliable industrial method. French, British and American inventors worked on this until a genuine stainless steel was produced. A common use of stainless steel is cutlery (knives, forks, and spoons). Stainless steel cutlery from Sheffield, Yorkshire, was a big industry in the mid-20th century.

<doc id="48855" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48855" title="Carbon steel">
Carbon steel

Carbon steel, also called plain-carbon steel, is a metal alloy, a combination of two elements, iron and carbon, where other elements are present in quantities too small to affect the properties. The only other alloying elements allowed in plain-carbon steel are: manganese (1.65% max), silicon (0.60% max), and copper (0.60% max). Steel with a low carbon content has the same properties as iron, soft but easily formed. As carbon content rises the metal becomes harder and stronger but less ductile and more difficult to weld. Higher carbon content lowers steel's melting point and its temperature resistance in general. 

Typical compositions of carbon are:





Steel can be heat-treated which allows parts to be fabricated in an easily-formable soft state. If enough carbon is present, the alloy can be hardened to increase strength, wear, and impact resistance. Steels are often wrought by cold-working methods, which is the shaping of metal through deformation at a low equilibrium or metastable temperature.

Mild steel is the most common form of steel as its price is relatively low while it provides material properties that are acceptable for many applications. Mild steel has a low carbon content (up to 0.3%) and is therefore neither extremely brittle nor ductile. It becomes malleable when heated, and so can be forged. It is also often used where large amounts of steel need to be formed, for example as structural steel. Density of this metal is 7861.093 kg/m³ (0.284 lb/in³) and the tensile strength is a maximum of 500 MPa (72500 psi)

Carbon steels which can successfully undergo heat-treatment have a carbon content in the range of 0.30% to 1.70% by weight. Trace impurities of various other elements can have a significant effect on the quality of the resulting steel. Trace amounts of sulfur in particular make the steel red-short. Low alloy carbon steel, such as A36 grade, contains about 0.05% sulfur and melts around 1426–1538° C (2600–2800° F). Manganese is often added to improve the hardenability of low carbon steels. These additions turn the material into a low alloy steel by some definitions, but AISI's definition of carbon steel allows up to 1.65% manganese by weight.

Hardened steel usually refers to quenched or quenched and tempered steel.
Silver Steel or high-carbon bright steel, gets its name from its appearance, due to the high carbon content. It is a very-high carbon steel, or can be thought of as some of the best high-carbon steel. It is defined under the steel specification standards BS-1407. It is a 1% carbon tool steel which can be ground to close tolerances. Usually the range of carbon is minimum 1.10% but as high as 1.20%. It also contains trace elements of 0.35% Mn (range 0.30%-0.40%), 0.40% Cr (range 0.4%-0.5%), 0.30% Si (range 0.1%-0.3%), and also sometimes sulfur (max 0.035%) and phosphorus (max 0.035%). Silver steel is sometimes used for making straight razors, due to its ability to produce and hold a micro-fine edge.

The purpose of heat treating plain-carbon steel is to change the mechanical properties of steel, usually ductility, hardness, yield strength, and impact resistance.

Defibrillation

Defibrillation is the act of defibrillating the heart to try treat ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Defibrillation works by delivering a controlled electric current to the heart, which depolarises a critical mass of the heart muscle, which stops the arrhythmia and allows a coordinated heart rhythm to return. Defibrillation may be administered outside the body with the use of an external defibrillator or an automated external defibrillator, or inside the body with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

The first use of the technique on a human was in 1947 by Claude Beck, a professor of surgery at Case Western Reserve University. The patient was a 14 year old boy named Mickey.

Defibrillator

A defibrillator is a machine that can help when ventricular fibrillation happens in the heart of a human. 

Fibrillation happens when many different cells in the heart begin to act as pacemaker cells. This means that many thousands of cells tell the heart to beat, all at different times and with no rhythm. This confusion causes the heart to become unable to move blood around the body. This causes death. 

A defibrillator sends an high energy pulse from the top-right of the heart to the bottom-middle of the heart. This causes the whole heart to stop all activity. The heart's normal pacemaker then can try and restart normal beating. Defibrillation does not always work.

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) are defibrillators that are designed to help patients from inside their body. They are put inside people that are at high-risk of going into cardiac arrest and monitor a person's heart rate, rhythm, and waveform. By comparing the activity in the different chambers of the heart, an icd can detect cardiac arrhythmias and treat them quickly.

External defibrillators are often used in hospitals and ambulances. They are now also being used outside of medical environments more as automated external defibrillators (see below) become safer and cheaper. There are many different types of external defibrillators, and progress in cardiac research has led to big improvements in the underlying technology.

Until recently, external defibrillators relied on monophasic ("one phase") shock waves. Electrical pulses are quickly sent from one electrode to the other in one direction. 

Biphasic ("two phases") defibrillation, however, changes the direction of the pulses. It completes one cycle in approximately 10 milliseconds. It significantly lowered the energy level necessary for successful defibrillation. This, in turn, has decreased the risk of burns and other damage. However, there is not much evidence to suggest that biphasic defibrillation is better than monophasic defibrillators. The small capacitor ("battery") size required for the defibrillator can result in large cost and size savings. 

An automated external defibrillator (AED) is a self-contained defibrillator device designed to be movable, and easy and simple to use. They are often shaped like briefcases so that they can be carried by a handle. An AED contains a battery, a control computer, and electrodes. When the electrodes are stuck onto the patient, the control computer will assess the patient, checking the rhythm of their heart. It will then charge itself to an appropriate power level and tell users that the person needs to be shocked. If the patient does not need to be defibrillated, the automated external defibrillator will not allow a shock to be administered. A button must still be pushed manually to trigger the shock, as the operator beforehand must be certain that nobody is touching the patient. Often, automated external defibrillators will have speakers which give instructions when they are opened. 

Current automated external defibrillator devices are designed for emergency medical technicians, home users, police and security officers and other people with minimal medical knowledge. These devices are commonly found in large gathering places, such as airports, casinos, sports stadiums, and college campuses.

The electrode is the part of the defibrillator that gives off the shock. 

The most well-known type of electrode is the traditional metal paddle with an insulated handle. This type must be held in place on the patient's skin while shocks are delivered. Before the paddles are used, gel must be applied to the patient's skin so that there is a good connection and to minimise electrical resistance. 

Another type of resuscitation electrode is designed as an adhesive pad which can be stuck onto the skin of a patient. These electrodes are left connected to a defibrillator. If defibrillation is required, the machine is charged, and the shock is delivered, without any need to apply any gel or to retrieve and place any paddles. 

Both solid- and wet-gel adhesive electrodes are available. Solid-gel electrodes are more convenient, because there is no need to clean the patient's skin after removing the electrodes. However, the use of solid-gel electrodes presents a higher risk of burns during defibrillation, since wet-gel electrodes more evenly conduct electricity into the body.

Defibrillators are often depicted in movies, television, video games and other fictional media. This is because it can quickly produce dramatic improvements in patient health. Their function, however, is often exaggerated. 

Medical providers are often shown defibrillating patients with a "flat-line" ECG rhythm (also known as asystole); this is not done in real life as the heart is not restarted by the defibrillator itself.

A curse is a word which threatens the other person to have bad luck. Nobody knows if it really works or become true. Some people believe in them even so, that they become true by magic.

There's also something called a "curse tablet" which most Romans used to curse people they did not like. They would often let them drift to the river so that the curse will be carried to where that person who has the curse. But many curses are made when people are jealous and they want that person who has the curse to not do well.

<doc id="48865" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48865" title="Ventricular fibrillation">
Ventricular fibrillation

Ventricular fibrillation (often shortened to VF or V-Fib) is a cardiac arrhythmia in which there is an uncoordinated contraction of the cardiac muscle of the ventricles in the heart. The heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly, and ventricular fibrillation can cause tachycardia and hypoxia. Ventricular fibrillation is a medical emergency. If it is allowed to continue for more than a few seconds, the blood will stop circulating, which is what causes the loss of a pulse and respiration, and the person will die.

Ventricular fibrillation is a cause of cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death. The ventricular muscle twitches randomly when it should contract in unison, and the ventricles cannot pump blood into the arteries and into the systemic circulation.

Ventricular fibrillation can often be reversed by the electric discharge of direct current from a defibrillator. If no defibrillator is available, a precordial thump can be delivered at the onset of VF to regain cardiac function, but they are not always effective. Antiarrhythmic agents such as amiodarone or lidocaine can help, but, unlike atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation rarely reverses spontaneously in large adult mammals. Although a defibrillator is designed to correct the problem, it is not always successful.

In patients at high risk of ventricular fibrillation the use of an 
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator has been shown to help.

Tachycardia is the fast beating of the heart. In adults, it refers to heart rates higher than 100 beats per minute. Tachhycardia may be a normal physiological response to stress, but depending on the cause and how healthy the patient is, tachycardia could be harmful and need medical treatment. In some cases, tachycardia can cause death.

Tachycardia can be harmful in two ways. First, when the heart beats too rapidly, it may perform inefficiently. Second, the faster the heart beats, the more oxygen and nutrients the heart requires. This can be especially problematic for patients suffering from ischaemic heart disease.

Stress (physics)

Stress in material science means that material is influenced in a way that may cause it to break or change its form.

Stress is the way in which the force per unit area is spread out in a cross-section of an item that balances and reacts to external loads applied to a body. It is a second-order tensor with nine dimensions, but can be fully described with six dimensions due to symmetry in the absence of body moments. Stress is often broken down into its shear and normal components as these have unique physical significance. It often results from built up pressure due to the lack of an outlet. 

Stress can be applied to solids, liquids and gases. Static fluids support normal stress (hydrostatic pressure) but will flow under shear stress. Moving viscous fluids can support shear stress (dynamic pressure). Solids can support both shear and normal stress, with ductile materials failing under shear and brittle materials failing under normal stress. All materials have temperature dependent variations in stress related properties.

All real objects occupy three-dimensional space. However, if two dimensions are very large or very small compared to the others, the object may be modelled as one-dimensional. This simplifies the mathematical modelling of the object. One-dimensional objects include a piece of wire loaded at the ends and viewed from the side, and a metal sheet loaded on the face and viewed up close and through the cross section.

Shear stress

Shear stress is a stress state where the stress is parallel to the surface of the material, as opposed to normal stress when the stress is vertical to the surface. 

Shear stress is relevant to themotion of fluids upon surfaces, which result in the generation of shear stress.
Also constructions in soil can fail due to shear; e.g., the weight of an earth-filled dam may cause the subsoil to collapse, like a small landslide.

Tensile stress

Tensile stress (or tension) is the stress state leading to expansion; that is, the length of a material tends to increase in the tensile direction. The volume of the material stays constant. When equal and opposite forces are applied on a body, then the stress due to this force is called tensile stress.

Therefore in a uniaxial material the length increases in the tensile stress direction and the other two directions will decrease in size. In the uniaxial manner of tension, tensile stress is induced by pulling forces. Tensile stress is the opposite of compressive stress.

Structural members in direct tension are ropes, soil anchors and nails, bolts, etc. Beams subjected to bending moments may include tensile stress as well as compressive stress and/or shear stress.

Tensile stress may be increased until the reach of tensile strength, namely the "limit state" of stress.

Tension (mechanics)

Tension is a reaction force applied by a stretched string (rope or a similar object) on the objects which stretch it. The direction of the force of tension is parallel to the string, towards the string.

Tension exists also inside the string itself: if the string is made up of two parts, tension is the force which the two parts of the string apply on each other. The amount of tension in the string determines whether it will break, as well as its vibrational properties, which are used in musical instruments.

<doc id="48891" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48891" title="Deformation">
Deformation

In engineering mechanics, deformation is a change in shape that is result of a force that influences the object. 

It can be a result of tensile (pulling) forces, compressive (pushing) forces, shear, bending or torsion (twisting).

Depending on the type of material, size and shape of the object, and the forces used, various types of deformation may result.

This type of deformation is reversible. Once the forces are no longer applied, the object returns to its original shape. As the name implies, elastic (rubber) has a rather large elastic deformation range. Soft thermoplastics and metals have moderate elastic deformation ranges while ceramics, crystals, and hard thermosetting plastics undergo almost no elastic deformation.

A phenomenon only discovered in modern times is metal fatigue, which occurs primarily in ductile metals. It was originally thought that a material deformed only within the elastic range returned completely to its original state once the forces were removed. However, faults are introduced at the molecular level with each deformation. After many deformations, cracks will begin to appear, followed soon after by a fracture, with no apparent plastic deformation in between. Depending on the material, shape, and how close to the elastic limit it is deformed, failure may require thousands, millions, billions, or trillions of deformations. 

Metal fatigue has been a major cause of aircraft failure, especially before the process was well understood. 

This type of deformation is not reversible. But an object in the plastic deformation range will first have undergone elastic deformation, which is reversible, so the object will return part way to its original shape. Soft thermoplastics have a rather large plastic deformation range as do ductile metals such as copper, silver, and gold. Steel does, too, but not iron. Hard thermosetting plastics, rubber, crystals, and ceramics have minimal plastic deformation ranges. Perhaps the material with the largest plastic deformation range is wet chewing gum, which can be stretched dozens of times its original length.

This type of deformation is also not reversible. A break occurs after the material has reached the end of the elastic, and then plastic, deformation ranges. At this point forces accumulate until they are sufficient to cause a fracture. All materials will eventually fracture, if sufficient forces are applied.

A popular misconception is that all materials that bend are "weak" and all those which do not are "strong". In reality, many materials which undergo large elastic and plastic deformations, such as steel, are able to absorb stresses which would cause brittle materials, such as glass, with minimal elastic and plastic deformation ranges, to break. There is even a story to describe this observation (paraphrased below):

Ceramic

The word ceramic is derived from the Greek word κεραμικός ("keramikos"). The term covers inorganic non-metallic materials which are formed by the action of heat. Up until the 1950s or so, the most important of these were the traditional clays, made into pottery, bricks, tiles and the like, along with cements and glass. Clay-based ceramics are described in the article on pottery. A composite material of ceramic and metal is known as cermet. The word "ceramic" can be an adjective, and can also be used as a noun to refer to a ceramic material, or a product of ceramic manufacture. "Ceramics" may also be used as a singular noun referring to the art of making things out of ceramic materials. The technology of manufacturing and usage of ceramic materials is part of the field of ceramic engineering.

Many ceramic materials are hard, porous, and brittle. The study and development of ceramics includes methods to mitigate problems associated with these characteristics, and to accentuate the strengths of the materials as well as to investigate novel applications.

The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) defines a ceramic article as “"an article having a glazed or unglazed body of crystalline or partly crystalline structure, or of glass, which body is produced from essentially inorganic, non-metallic substances and either is formed from a molten mass which solidifies on cooling, or is formed and simultaneously or subsequently matured by the action of the heat".”

For convenience ceramic products are usually divided into four sectors, and these are shown below with some examples:


Technical ceramics can also be classified into three distinct material categories: 

Each one of these classes can develop unique material properties.


Ceramic materials are usually ionic or covalent bonded materials, and can be crystalline or amorphous. A material held together by either type of bond will tend to fracture before any plastic deformation takes place, which results in poor toughness in these materials. Additionally, because these materials tend to be porous, the pores and other microscopic imperfections act as stress concentrators, decreasing the toughness further, and reducing the tensile strength. These combine to give catastrophic failures, as opposed to the normally much more gentle failure modes of metals. 

These materials do show plastic deformation. However, due to the rigid structure of the crystalline materials, there are very few available slip systems for dislocations to move, and so they deform very slowly. With the non-crystalline (glassy) materials, viscous flow is the dominant source of plastic deformation, and is also very slow. It is therefore neglected in many applications of ceramic materials.

There are a number of ceramics that are semiconductors. Most of these are transition metal oxides that are II-VI semiconductors, such as zinc oxide.

While there is talk of making blue LEDs from zinc oxide, ceramicists are most interested in the electrical properties that show grain boundary effects.

One of the most widely used of these is the varistor. These are devices that exhibit the property that resistance drops sharply at a certain threshold voltage. Once the voltage across the device reaches the threshold, there is a breakdown of the electrical structure in the vicinity of the grain boundaries, which results in its electrical resistance dropping from several megohms down to a few hundred ohms. The major advantage of these is that they can dissipate a lot of energy, and they self reset—after the voltage across the device drops below the threshold, its resistance returns to being high. 

This makes them ideal for surge-protection applications. As there is control over the threshold voltage and energy tolerance, they find use in all sorts of applications. The best demonstration of their ability can be found in electrical substations, where they are employed to protect the infrastructure from lightning strikes. They have rapid response, are low maintenance, and do not appreciably degrade from use, making them virtually ideal devices for this application.

Semiconducting ceramics are also employed as gas sensors. When various gases are passed over a polycrystalline ceramic, its electrical resistance changes. With tuning to the possible gas mixtures, very inexpensive devices can be produced.

Under some conditions, such as extremely low temperature, some ceramics exhibit high temperature superconductivity. The exact reason for this is not known, but there are two major families of superconducting ceramics .

Piezoelectricity, a link between electrical and mechanical response, is exhibited by a large number of ceramic materials, including the quartz used to measure time in watches and other electronics. Such devices use both properties of piezoelectrics, using electricity to produce a mechanical motion (powering the device) and then using this mechanical motion to produce electricity (generating a signal). The unit of time measured is the natural interval required for electricity to be converted into mechanical energy and back again.

The piezoelectric effect is generally stronger in materials that also exhibit pyroelectricity, and all pyroelectric materials are also piezoelectric. These materials can be used to inter convert between thermal, mechanical, and/or electrical energy; for instance, after synthesis in a furnace, a pyroelectric crystal allowed to cool under no applied stress generally builds up a static charge of thousands of volts. Such materials are used in motion sensors, where the tiny rise in temperature from a warm body entering the room is enough to produce a measurable voltage in the crystal.

In turn, pyroelectricity is seen most strongly in materials which also display the ferroelectric effect, in which a stable electric dipole can be oriented or reversed by applying an electrostatic field. Pyroelectricity is also a necessary consequence of ferroelectricity. This can be used to store information in ferroelectric capacitors, elements of ferroelectric RAM.

The most common such materials are lead zirconate titanate and barium titanate. Aside from the uses mentioned above, their strong piezoelectric response is exploited in the design of high-frequency loudspeakers, transducers for sonar, and actuators for atomic force and scanning tunneling microscopes.

Increases in temperature can cause grain boundaries to suddenly become insulating in some semiconducting ceramic materials, mostly mixtures of heavy metal titanates. The critical transition temperature can be adjusted over a wide range by variations in chemistry. In such materials, current will pass through the material until joule heating brings it to the transition temperature, at which point the circuit will be broken and current flow will cease. Such ceramics are used as self-controlled heating elements in, for example, the rear-window defrost circuits of automobiles.

At the transition temperature, the material's dielectric response becomes theoretically infinite. While a lack of temperature control would rule out any practical use of the material near its critical temperature, the dielectric effect remains exceptionally strong even at much higher temperatures. Titanates with critical temperatures far below room temperature have become synonymous with "ceramic" in the context of ceramic capacitors for just this reason.

Non-crystalline ceramics:
Non-crystalline ceramics, being glasses, tend to be formed from melts. The glass is shaped when either fully molten, by casting, or when in a state of toffee-like viscosity, by methods such as blowing to a mold. If later heat-treatments cause this class to become partly crystalline, the resulting material is known as a glass-ceramic.

Crystalline ceramics:
Crystalline ceramic materials are not amenable to a great range of processing. Methods for dealing with them tend to fall into one of two categories – either make the ceramic in the desired shape, by reaction in situ, or by "forming" powders into the desired shape, and then sintering to form a solid body. Ceramic forming techniques include shaping by hand (sometimes including a rotation process called "throwing"), slip casting, tape casting (used for making very thin ceramic capacitors, etc.), injection molding, dry pressing, and other variations. (See also Ceramic forming techniques. Details of these processes are described in the two books listed below.) A few methods use a hybrid between the two approaches.

The most common use of this method is in the production of cement and concrete. Here, the dehydrated powders are mixed with water. This starts hydration reactions, which result in long, interlocking crystals forming around the aggregates. Over time, these result in a solid ceramic.

The biggest problem with this method is that most reactions are so fast that good mixing is not possible, which tends to prevent large-scale construction. However, small-scale systems can be made by deposition techniques, where the various materials are introduced above a substrate, and react and form the ceramic on the substrate. This borrows techniques from the semiconductor industry, such as chemical vapour deposition, and is very useful for coatings.

These tend to produce very dense ceramics, but do so slowly.

The principles of sintering-based methods is simple. Once a roughly held together object (called a "green body") is made, it is baked in a kiln, where diffusion processes cause the green body to shrink. The pores in the object close up, resulting in a denser, stronger product. The firing is done at a temperature below the melting point of the ceramic. There is virtually always some porosity left, but the real advantage of this method is that the green body can be produced in any way imaginable, and still be sintered. This makes it a very versatile route. 

There are thousands of possible refinements of this process. Some of the most common involve pressing the green body to give the densification a head start and reduce the sintering time needed. Sometimes organic binders such as polyvinyl alcohol are added to hold the green body together; these burn out during the firing (at 200–350 °C). Sometimes organic lubricants are added during pressing to increase densification. It is not uncommon to combine these, and add binders and lubricants to a powder, then press. (The formulation of these organic chemical additives is an art in itself. This is particularly important in the manufacture of high performance ceramics such as those used by the billions for electronics, in capacitors, inductors, sensors, etc. The specialized formulations most commonly used in electronics are detailed in the book "Tape Casting," by R.E. Mistler, et al., Amer. Ceramic Soc. [Westerville, Ohio], 2000.) A comprehensive book on the subject, for mechanical as well as electronics applications, is "Organic Additives and Ceramic Processing," by D. J. Shanefield, Kluwer Publishers [Boston], 1996.

A slurry can be used in place of a powder, and then cast into a desired shape, dried and then sintered. Indeed, traditional pottery is done with this type of method, using a plastic mixture worked with the hands.

If a mixture of different materials is used together in a ceramic, the sintering temperature is sometimes above the melting point of one minor component – a "liquid phase" sintering. This results in shorter sintering times compared to solid state sintering.

An inorganic compound is a chemical compound which is "not" an organic compound. That means it is not a carbon-based compound.

The division between the two types of compound is not absolute. Some carbon-containing compounds are traditionally considered inorganic. Many chemicals in nature are not compounds, but are ions. Sodium, chloride, and phosphate ions are essential for life, as are some inorganic molecules such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water and oxygen. Aside from these simple ions and molecules, virtually all compounds covered by biochemistry contain carbon and can be considered organic or organometallic.

Applied mechanics, also known as theoretical and applied mechanics, is a branch of the physical sciences and the practical application of mechanics. Applied mechanics examines the "response of bodies (solids and fluids) to external forces". Some examples of "mechanical systems" include the flow of a liquid under pressure, the fracture of a solid from an applied force, or the vibration of an ear in response to sound. A practitioner of the discipline is known as a mechanician.

Mechanics is the branch of physics which looks at bodies that are influenced by forces and moved.

The discipline has its roots in ancient Greece where Aristotle studied the way bodies behaved when they were thrown through the air (e.g. a stone). However it was Galileo, Kepler and especially Newton who lay the foundation for much of the so called "Newtonian mechanics" we know today.

A person working in the discipline is known as a mechanician.

Mechanics is the original discipline of physics, dealing with the macroscopic world that humans perceive. It is therefore a huge body of knowledge about the natural world. Mechanics encompasses the movement of all matter in the universe under the four forces: gravity, the strong and weak interactions, and the electromagnetic interaction.

Mechanics also constitutes a central part of technology

One may use the term "macroscopic" also for a "larger view", namely a view only available from a large perspective. A macroscopic position could be considered the "big picture".

But if one would compare the surface of an orange with that of the earth, one would say the surface of the earth is many "orders of magnitude" larger than that of the orange.

Orders of magnitude are generally used to make very approximate comparisons. If two numbers differ by one order of magnitude, one is about ten times larger than the other. If they differ by two orders of magnitude, they differ by a factor of about 100. Two numbers of the same order of magnitude have roughly the same scale: the larger value is less than ten times the smaller value.

Pantheism is the belief that God and the universe are equivalent (the same thing.) A pantheist believes that everything that exists is a part of God, and that God is nothing more than everything that exists. The name pantheism comes from the words theism (belief in God) and pan (all). 

Any doctrine or philosophy that believes that the universe and everything in it is God is said to be pantheistic. Most pantheists believe the universe is sacred and the earth and nature are divine. Pantheists are sometimes called nature worshipers.

Most of the early Greek philosophers from Thales on to Aristotle believed in some sort of pantheism.

Pantheism is an important part of many eastern religions such as Hinduism and Taoism.

Some western philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza and scientists like Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking are pantheists. While many hold pantheistic ideas, their beliefs are hard to determine. Albert Einstein was an example: he held many pantheistic views, but did not consider himself a pantheist.

"I'm not an atheist and I don't think I can call myself a pantheist. We are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many different languages. The child knows someone must have written those books. It does not know how. The child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the arrangement of the books but doesn't know what it is. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward God."
—Albert Einstein

Boer (IPA: /bur/) is the Dutch word for farmer which is used to call the descendants of the Dutch farmers of Southern Africa during the 1700s, as well as those who left the Cape Colony during the 1800s to live in the Orange Free State, Transvaal. They did this to escape the British rule, and the wars between the British imperial government and the native tribes on the eastern frontier. 

In 1657, “vrybriewe” was granted to 9 burgers, the first farmers or Boers (Boere) at the Cape. Although they were not known as Afrikaners, they did not regard themselves as living in a European country. As more and more immigrants from Europe arrived at the Cape the more international marriages took place. Soon their language and culture was lost and transformed into the Dietse nation. They regarded themselves as a new nation. Paul Heyns, born in 1696 christened his son Michiel Afrikanus (the Afrikaner). One Hendrik Bieslow in 1707 proclaimed in public “Ik ben een Afrikaander”. The Boer later created the Boer Republics, which were deafeated in the 1880-1881 and 1899–1902 Anglo-Boer wars (Anglo-Boere-oorlog). After that, many Boers emigrated to other countries, but many still live in modern South Africa, Swaziland and Rhodesia.

Compressive stress is the stress on materials that leads to a smaller volume. 

By compressive stress the material is under compression. Compressive stress to bars, columns, etc. leads to shortening.

Rotation

Rotation is the movement of an object in a circular motion. 

A two-dimensional object rotates around a "center" (or "point") "of rotation". A three-dimensional object rotates around a line called an "axis". If the axis of rotation is within the body, the body is said to rotate upon itself, or "spin"— which implies relative speed and perhaps free-movement with angular momentum. A circular motion about an external point (for example the Earth around the Sun) is called an "orbit" or more properly "orbital revolution."

Rotation around a point in one plane can be in a clockwise direction or an anticlockwise direction.

In flight dynamics, the principal rotations are known as "pitch", "roll" and "yaw". The term rotation is also used in aviation to refer to the upward pitch of an aircraft, particularly when starting the major climb for takeoff. 

Many amusement rides provide rotation. A Ferris wheel and observation wheel have a horizontal central axis, and parallel axes for each gondola, where the rotation is opposite, by gravity or mechanically. 

Rotation, usually called "spin", plays a role in many sports. "Topspin" and "backspin" in tennis. "English", "follow" and "draw" in billiards and pool. Curve balls in baseball and spin bowling in cricket. Table tennis paddles are specialized to allow players to spin the ball as they hit it.

Moment (physics)

In physics, the moment of force (often just moment) means the magnitude of force that influences the rotation of an object. 

In this concept the moment arm, the distance from the axis of rotation, plays an important role. The lever, pulley, gear, and most other simple machines create mechanical advantage by changing the moment arm. The SI unit for moment is the newton meter (Nm).

The principle of moments is derived from Archimedes' discovery of the operating principle of the lever. In the lever one applies a force, in his day most often human muscle, to an "arm", a beam of some sort. Archimedes noted that the amount of force applied to the object, the "moment of force", is defined as "M = rF", where "F" is the applied force, and "r" is the distance from the applied force to object.

Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia

Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia (, , – 17 July 1918) was the youngest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and his wife Alexandra Fyodorovna. Anastasia was murdered with her family on 17 July 1918 by the Bolshevik secret police. She was a sister of Grand Duchess Olga, Grand Duchess Tatiana, Grand Duchess Maria, and Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia. 

During the years of Communist rule nobody knew where she was buried. This led to many stories that she could have escaped and still be alive. The bodies of the Tsar, Tsarina, and three daughters were found in a grave near Yekaterinburg in 1991; however, the bodies of Alexei Nikolaevich and one of his sisters (either Anastasia or Maria) were not there.

In January 2008, Russian scientists said that the remains of a young boy and woman found near Yekaterinburg in August 2007 might be the missing bodies. On 30 April 2008, Russian scientists used DNA testing to prove that they were the Tsarevich Alexei and his sister. In March 2009, the last results of the DNA testing were published by Dr. Michael Coble of the US Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory. This proved that all four Grand Duchesses were murdered.

Several women have claimed to have been Anastasia. The most famous was Anna Anderson. However, DNA testing in 1994 on pieces of Anderson's tissue and hair showed that she was not related to the Imperial family.

When Anastasia was born, her family was disappointed. They had hoped for a son who would be heir to the throne. In honor of her birth, her father forgave the students who had been put in prison for joining in riots in St. Petersburg and Moscow. Because of this, Anastasia's name means "the breaker of chains" or the "prison opener". It can also mean "of the resurrection". People often spoke of this when there were stories that she had not died. Anastasia was a Grand Duchess. Because this made Anastasia an "Imperial Highness", she was higher in rank than other Princesses in Europe who were "Royal Highnesses".

The Tsar's children lived very simply. They slept on hard camp cots without pillows when they were healthy, took cold baths in the morning, and had to clean their rooms and sometimes sew. Most of their servants usually called Anastasia by her first name instead of calling her "Her Imperial Highness". Sometimes they called her "Anastasie", "Nastya", "Nastas", or "Nastenka". Anastasia was also called "Malenkaya", meaning "little (one)", or "shvibzik", the Russian word for "imp".
Anastasia was a bright, lively child. People described her as short and plump, with blue eyes and blonde hair. Margaretta Eagar, Anastasia's governess, said that somebody had once called young Anastasia the most charming child he had ever seen. Lili Dehn said that Anastasia was "pretty", but had "more of a clever face, and her eyes were wells of intelligence".

Anastasia was clever, but she was never much interested in studying. Pierre Gilliard, Sydney Gibbes, and ladies-in-waiting Lili Dehn and Anna Vyrubova said that Anastasia was funny and good at acting. Some people did not like her sharp, quick remarks.

Anastasia's playful behavior was often punished. According to Gieb Botkin, "in naughtiness she was a true genius". He was the son of the court doctor Yevgeny Botkin, who later died with the family at Ekaterinburg. Anastasia tripped the servants, tricked her teachers, and climbed trees and refused to come down. Once at a snowball fight, she rolled a rock into a snowball and threw it at her older sister, Tatiana. Princess Nina Georgievna, Anastasia's cousin, said that "Anastasia was nasty to the point of being evil". She said that Anastasia would get angry when her friends won games, or when the younger Nina was taller than she was. She also cared less about her looks than her sisters. Hallie Erminie Rives, an American writer, described how Anastasia ate chocolates without taking off her white opera gloves at the St. Petersburg opera house when she was 10-years-old.
Anastasia's family called Anastasia and her older sister Maria "The Little Pair". This was because they shared a room, often wore the same dress, and played together a lot. Their older sisters Olga and Tatiana were known as "The Big Pair", because they shared a room as well. The four girls sometimes signed letters with their nickname, OTMA. They made this nickname from the first letters of their first names, Olga, Tatiana, Maria, and Anastasia.

Anastasia was very energetic, but she was often sick. She had "hallux valgus" (bunions), which hurt both of her big toes. Anastasia also had a weak muscle in her back. Because of this, she had to be massaged twice every week. She disliked this, and when it was time to be massaged, she would hide under her bed or in cupboards. Anastasia's older sister, Maria, is said to have hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils. The doctor performing the operation was so shocked that Maria's mother, Tsarina Alexandra, had to order him to continue. Olga Alexandrovna said all four of her nieces bled more than was normal. She believed they had the hemophilia gene, like their mother. Some carriers of the gene are not hemophiliacs themselves, but they can have signs of hemophilia, like bleeding more than most people. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved in 2009 that Alexei suffered from Hemophilia B. His mother and one of his sisters were carriers. The Russians thought this sister was Maria, and Americans thought it was Anastasia. If Anastasia had lived, she could have passed on the disease to her children. Anastasia, like everyone else in her family, loved "Baby" Tsarevich Alexei very much. Alexei often had attacks of hemophilia and nearly died several times.

Her mother trusted Grigori Rasputin, a Russian peasant and wandering "holy man". She thought his prayers had saved her son when he was sick many times. Anastasia and her sisters were told to treat Rasputin as "Our Friend" and to tell him their secrets. In the autumn of 1907, Anastasia's aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia went to the nursery with the Tsar to meet Rasputin. Anastasia, her sisters and brother Alexei were all wearing their long white nightgowns.

"All the children seemed to like him," Olga Alexandrovna said later. "They were completely at ease (comfortable) with him." Rasputin's friendship with the Imperial children can be seen in some of the messages he sent to them. In February 1909, Rasputin sent them a telegram, saying, "Love the whole of God's nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework."

But in 1910, Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva told other people in the family that Rasputin was allowed to see the four girls when they were wearing their nightgowns. Rasputin's visits to the children were completely innocent, but the family was shocked and angry. Tyutcheva told Nicholas's sister, Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, that Rasputin visited and talked to the girls while they were getting ready for bed, and hugged and patted them. Tyutcheva said the children did not talk about Rasputin with her and kept his visits a secret. Tatiana wrote to her mother on 8 March 1910, that she was "so afr(aid) that S.I. (governess Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva) can our friend something bad". Xenia wrote on 15 March 1910 that she did not understand "the attitude (behavior) of Alix and the children to that sinister Grigory". Nicholas asked Rasputin not to go into the nursery after that, and Alexandra later fired Tyutcheva.

In the spring of 1910, Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova, a royal governess, said that Rasputin had raped her. The empress did not believe her, saying that "everything Rasputin does is holy". Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that they had made an investigation to see if what Vishnyakova said was true, but that "they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard." Vishnyakova was kept from seeing Rasputin after she claimed that he raped her. She was fired in 1913.
But rumors still spread. People suggested that Rasputin had seduced the Tsarina and her four daughters. Rasputin had written warm, but completely innocent letters to the Tsarina and her four daughters. He released the letters, which made people gossip even more. "My dear, precious, only friend," wrote Anastasia. "How much I should like to see you again. You appeared to me today in a dream. I am always asking Mama when you will think of you always, my dear, because you are so good to me ..."

Soon after, pornographic cartoons were printed about Rasputin having relations with the Empress, her four daughters and Anna Vyrubovna. After the scandal, Nicholas asked Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg for a time. Rasputin went on a pilgrimage to Palestine. Alexandra was very angry at this. However, though the rumors continued, the imperial family continued to be friendly with Rasputin until he was murdered on 17 December 1916. "Our Friend is so contented (happy) with our girlies, souls have much developed," Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on December 6, 1916.

Later, A.A. Mordvinov reported in his memoirs that the four Grand Duchesses looked "cold and visibly terribly upset" by Rasputin's death. He added that they sat "huddled up closely together" on a sofa on the night they heard he was killed. Mordvinov remembered that they were sad and seemed to feel the beginning of great political troubles. Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on the back by Anastasia, her mother and her sisters. Anastasia went to his funeral on December 21, 1916. Her family planned to build a church over Rasputin's grave. After they were killed by the Bolsheviks, it was discovered Anastasia and her sisters were all wearing amulets with Rasputin's picture and a prayer on it.

During World War I Anastasia and her sister Maria visited hurt soldiers at a hospital at Tsarskoye Selo. Because they were too young to become Red Cross nurses like their mother and older sisters, they played checkers and billiards with the soldiers and tried to make them happy instead. Felix Dassel, who was treated at the hospital, remembered that Anastasia had a "laugh like a squirrel", and walked quickly "as though she "tripped" along." 

In February 1917, Nicholas II resigned from the throne. Anastasia and her family were placed under house arrest at the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoye Selo during the Russian Revolution. As the Bolsheviks came nearer, Alexander Kerensky moved them to Tobolsk, Siberia. The Bolsheviks grew more and more powerful. Anastasia and her family were moved to the Ipatiev House (House of Special Purpose), at Yekaterinburg.

Anastasia felt sad about her captivity. "Goodby," she wrote to a friend in the winter of 1917. "Don't forget us." At Tobolsk, she wrote a sad theme for her English teacher, filled with spelling mistakes, about "Evelyn Hope", a poem by Robert Browning about a young girl. "When she died she was only sixteen years old," Anastasia wrote. "Ther(e) was a man who loved her without having seen her but (k)new her very well. And she he(a)rd of him also. He never could tell her that he loved her, and now she was dead. But still he thought that when he and she will live [their] next life whenever it will be that ..." 

At Tobolsk, she and her sisters sewed jewels into their clothes. This was because Alexandra, Nicholas and Maria had had their things taken away when they arrived in Ekaterinburg. Demidova wrote to Tegleva about this, using code words for the jewels such as "medicines" and "Sednev's belongings". Anastasia and her sisters dressed simply, and all three had their hair cut short. It had been cut when they were ill with measles in 1917, and they had kept it short. Pierre Gilliard remembered his last sight of the children: "The sailor Nagorny, who attended to Alexei Nikolaevitch, passed my window carrying the sick boy in his arms, behind him came the Grand Duchesses loaded with valises and small personal belongings. I tried to get out, but was roughly pushed back into the carriage by the sentry. I came back to the window. Tatiana Nikolayevna came last carrying her little dog and struggling to drag a heavy brown valise. It was raining and I saw her feet sink into the mud at every step. Nagorny tried to come to her assistance (help); he was roughly pushed back by one of the commisars ..." Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden, too, spoke of her last sad memory of Anastasia: "Once, standing on some steps at the door of a house close by, I saw a hand and a pink-sleeved arm opening the topmost (highest) pane. According to the blouse the hand must have belonged either to the Grand Duchess Marie or Anastasia. They could not see me through their windows, and this was to be the last glimpse that I was to have of any of them!"

But even in the last months of her life, Anastasia could be happy. She and other members of her family performed plays for their parents and others in the spring of 1918. Her tutor Sydney Gibbes said that Anastasia's acting made everyone laugh. On 7 May 1918, Anastasia wrote a letter from Tobolsk to her sister Maria in Yekaterinburg. In the letter, she described a moment of joy, even though she was sad, lonely, and worried about her sick brother Alexei: "We played on the swing, that was when I roared with laughter (laughed loudly), the fall was so wonderful! Indeed! I told the sisters about it so many times yesterday that they got quite fed up (tired)", adding, "One could simply shout with joy." In his memoirs, Alexander Strekotin, one of the guards at the Ipatiev House, called Anastasia "very friendly and full of fun". Another guard said Anastasia was "a very charming devil! She was mischievous and, I think, rarely (not often) tired. She was lively, and was fond of (enjoyed) performing comic mimes with the dogs, as though they were performing in a circus." Another guard, however, called her "offensive and a terrorist" and complained about some of her sharp remarks. Anastasia and her sisters learned to wash their own clothes and make bread at the Ipatiev House.

In the summer, however, the whole family became much sadder. According to some accounts, Anastasia once became so unhappy about the locked, painted windows that she opened one to get fresh air. A guard is said to have seen her and fired, almost hitting her. She did not try to open the windows again.

On 14 July 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg held a private church service for the family. They later said that Anastasia and her family fell on their knees during the prayers for the dead, which they had not done before. They also noted that the girls had become very sad and did not reply to the service. One of the priests said, "Something has happened to them in there." But the next day, on 15 July 1918, Anastasia and her sisters seemed happier. They joked and helped move the beds in their shared bedroom so that the cleaning women could clean the floors. Helping the women scrub the floors, they whispered to them when the guards were not watching. Anastasia even stuck her tongue out at Yakov Yurovsky, the head of the guards, when he turned his back and left the room.

Anastasia was executed with her family by a firing squad in the early morning of 17 July 1918. They had been killed by the Bolshevik secret police, commanded by Yurovsky.

In October 1917, the Bolshevik revolution struck Russia. A civil war began shortly after that. Plans to release the Romanovs slowed down. As the Whites (people who were still faithful to the Tsar and autocracy) came more toward Yekaterinburg, the Reds felt afraid. They knew that the well-prepared White Army would win. When the Whites reached Yekaterinburg, the Imperial Family were gone. It is thought that the family had been executed.

The "Yurovsky Note" was found in 1989 and described in Edvard Radzinsky's 1992 book "The Last Tsar". The "Yurovsky Note" was a description of the event by Yurovsky after the execution. According to the note, on the night of the murders the family was awakened and told to dress. They were told they were moving to a new place for their safety. They claimed it was because of the possible violence which might happen when the White Army reached Yekaterinburg. When they were dressed, the family and the few servants were led to a small room in the house's basement. They were told to wait there. Alexandra asked for chairs for herself and Alexei, and she sat next to her son. After a short time, the executioners entered the room, led by Yurovsky. Yurovsky quickly told the Tsar and his family that they were going to die. The Tsar cried "What?" and turned to his family, but was immediately killed when several bullets hit his chest. The Tsar, the empress, and two servants were killed in the first round of shooting. Maria, Dr. Botkin and Alexandra's maid Demidova were hurt. Thick smoke and dust filled the room from the shooting, so the gunmen left the room for a few minutes. They soon came back and shot Dr. Botkin. A gunman named Ermakov tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei, but the jewels in the boy's clothes protected him. Ermakov tried to kill Alexei with a bayonet but failed again. At last, Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head. Tatiana and Olga were near the wall. They were holding onto each other and crying for their mother. Tatiana was killed by a shot to her head. Olga died when Ermakov shot her in the jaw.

Maria, Anastasia, and the maid Demidova were on the floor under the room's one window. Ermakov said that he killed Maria by shooting her head. Ermakov then tried to stab Anastasia, failed, and said he killed her by shooting her head. Maria's skull does not have any bullet wounds, though. It is unclear how she died. Ermakov was drunk during the murders, and it is possible his shot did not go entirely through her head. She might have become unconscious and bled greatly, but remained alive. Then, as the bodies were taken away, two of the grand duchesses moved. One sat up and screamed, throwing her arm over her head. The other, bleeding from the mouth, moaned and moved. When Olga and Tatiana were shot, they were killed instantly, so Maria was probably the one who screamed. Anastasia might still have been able to move. Ermakov told his wife that Anastasia was killed by a bayonet, and Yurovsky wrote that as the bodies were carried out, one or more of the girls cried out and were hit on the back of the head with a club. However, the back of Maria's skull does not show any signs of having been clubbed. The remains of Anastasia's burnt body do not show details of how she died.

One of the greatest mysteries of the 20th century was if Anastasia had survived or not. From 1920 to 1922, Anna Anderson, the most famous person who pretended to be Anastasia, grew very famous. She claimed that she had pretended to be dead, then escaped with the help of a kind guard that saved her from the dead bodies after seeing she was still alive. Her legal struggle to be recognized as Anastasia from 1938 to 1970 was a controversy for her whole life. It was the longest running case ever heard by the German courts. At last, the courts decided that there was not enough proof.

Anderson died in 1984 and her body was cremated. In 1994, a tissue sample from Andersen in a hospital was used for DNA tests with the blood of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Prince Philip was a grandnephew of Empress Alexandra. Dr. Gill, who did the tests, decided that if "you accept that these samples came from Anna Anderson, then Anna Anderson could related to Tsar Nicholas or Tsarina Alexandra." Anderson's DNA matched with a great-nephew of Franziska Schanzkowska, a missing Polish factory worker. Some people who supported Anderson agreed that the DNA tests showed she could not have been the Grand Duchess.

At least 10 women claimed to be Anastasia. Less famous people who pretended to be Anastasia were Nadezhda Ivanovna Vasilyeva and Eugenia Smith. A priest took care of two young women who said that they were Anastasia and her sister Maria in the Ural Mountains in 1919. They lived there as nuns until they died in 1964. They were buried with the names Anastasia and Maria Nikolaevna. 

People reported that trains and houses were being searched for 'Anastasia Romanov' by soldiers and secret police. When she was put in prison for a short time at Perm in 1918, Princess Helena Petrovna, the wife of Anastasia's distant cousin, Prince Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia, said that a guard took a girl who called herself Anastasia Romanova to her cell and asked her if the girl was the Tsar's daughter. When she did not recognize the girl, the guard took her away. Others in Perm later said that they saw Anastasia, her mother and sisters in Perm after they were killed, but this was only a rumor. Surprisingly, the rumors that had started to hide the fact that the family was dead helped the rumors that they were alive. A few days after they had been killed, the German government sent telegrams to Russia asking for "the safety of the princesses of German blood". Russia had signed a peace treaty with the Germans and did not want to tell them that the women were dead. Instead, they told them they had been moved to a safer place. This could have been why the 'Perm stories' began.

Another time, eight people said that they saw a young woman being captured at a railway station at Siding 37 in September 1918 after trying to escape. These people were Maxim Grigoyev, Tatiana Sitnikova and her son Fyodor Sitnikov, Ivan Kuklin and Matrina Kuklina, Vassily Ryabov, Ustinya Varankina, and Dr. Pavel Utkin. Some of these people said that the girl was Anastasia when they saw photographs of the grand duchess by White Russian Army investigators. Dr. Pavel Utkin also told the investigators that the girl, whom he had helped in Perm when she was hurt, had said, "I am the daughter of the ruler, Anastasia." During that time, there were similar stories of young people in Russia saying that they were Romanovs who had escaped. Boris Soloviev, the husband of Rasputin's daughter Maria, defrauded many important Russian families by asking for money for a Romanov to escape to China. Soloviev was helped by young women who pretended to be one of the grand duchesses to help trick the families.

Some suggest that there might have been a way for a guard to save anyone in the family who still lived. Yakov Yurovsky ordered the guards to come to his office and give him the things they had stolen after the murder. At that time, it is said that there was a short time when the killed bodies were left in the truck and in the basement of the house. Some guards who had not joined in the murders and had felt sorry for the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.

There were also stories from Bulgaria that Anastasia and her brother were still alive. In 1953, Peter Zamiatkin told a 16-year-old person being treated at a hospital that he had taken Anastasia and Alexei to the village where he was born near Odessa. He said he was a member of the guard of the Romanovs, and that the Tsar had asked him to do this. Zamiatkin said that after the rest of the family had been killed, he escaped with the children on a ship. "Anastasia" and "Alexei" lived under false names in the Bulgarian town of Gabarevo. The Bulgarian "Anastasia" called herself Eleonora Albertovna Kruger. She died in 1954.

In 1991, the place where the Imperial family and their servants were supposedly buried as found in the woods outside Yekaterinburg. It had actually been found almost ten years earlier, but had been kept hidden by the people who discovered it. They did not want the Communists, who still ruled Russia at that time, to know where the grave was. The grave only had nine bodies instead of 11. DNA and studies on their skeletons showed that they were the bodies of Tsar Nicholas II, his wife, and three of the Grand Duchesses (Olga, Tatiana, and Maria). The other remains had different DNA. They were the bodies of the family's doctor (Yevgeny Botkin), valet (Alexei Trupp), cook (Ivan Kharitonov) and Alexandra's maid (Anna Demidova). Dr. William Maples decided that the Tsarevitch Alexei and Anastasia's bodies were missing. Russian scientists did not agree with this. They claimed that it was the body of Maria was missing, not Anastasia's. The Russians used a computer program to compare photos of Anastasia with the skulls from the grave. When some of the pieces of bone in the skulls were missing, they guessed how long or wide it was instead. American scientists thought this way of studying the bodies was wrong. 
American scientists thought the missing body was Anastasia's. This was because none of the female skeletons showed signs that it was not fully grown yet. The remains of the Imperial Family were buried in 1998. At that time, a body that measured about 5 feet, 7 inches (170 cm) was buried as the body of Anastasia. Photographs of her standing next to her sisters six months before she died show that Anastasia was a few inches shorter than all of them.

The "Yurovsky Note" showed that two of the bodies were taken from the main grave and burned secretly to hide the burials of the Imperial family. However, people could not find the place where the bodies were burnt for many years. However, on 23 August 2007, a Russian archaeologist declared that he had found two burned skeletons near Yekaterinburg, at a place which seemed to match what was described in Yurovsky's writings. The archaeologists said that the bones were from a boy who was about 10 to 13, and a young woman who was between 18 and 23 years old. Anastasia was 17 years and one month old when she was killed; Maria was 19 years, one month old, and Alexei was just two weeks before his fourteenth birthday. Anastasia's older sisters, Olga and Tatiana, were 22 and 23 when they died. They used metal detectors to find the bones.

Many international laboratories such as the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory and Innsbruck Medical University did DNA tests. They proved that the remains were from the body of Tsarevich Alexei and one of his sister. They agreed that everyone in the family, including Anastasia, died in 1918. All the parents and children has his or her own special DNA.

In 2000, Anastasia and her family were canonized as passion bearers by the Russian Orthodox Church. In 1981, they had already been canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad as holy martyrs. The bodies of Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of their daughters were buried in the St. Catherine Chapel at St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg on 17 July 1998. This was 80 years after they had been murdered.

The stories of how Anastasia might have escaped became the subject of theatrical and television films. The earliest, made in 1928, was called "Clothes Make the Woman". The story was about a woman who acts the character of Anastasia in a Hollywood film, and is later recognized by the Russian soldier who saved her.

In 1956, a movie called "Anastasia" was made. Ingrid Bergman acted Anna Anderson, Yul Brynner was General Bounine (a fictional character based on several real men), and Helen Hayes as the Dowager Empress Marie, Anastasia's grandmother. The film is about a woman from an asylum who came to Paris in 1928 and was captured by some Russian émigrés who use her so that they can fool Anastasia's grandmother into thinking Anderson actually is her granddaughter. This is because they want to get a Tsarist fortune. After some time, they begin wondering if "Madame A. Anderson" really is the missing Grand Duchess.
This story was also used for the short 1965 musical "Anya".

In 1986, NBC began a mini-series inspired by a book published in 1983 by Peter Kurth called "Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson". The movie, "", was a series with two parts. It began with the young Anastasia Nicholaievna and her family being sent to Yekaterinburg, where they are killed by Bolshevik soldiers. The story then moves to 1923, saying that Anna Anderson is Anastasia. Amy Irving was the actress for Anna Anderson.

The most recent film is 1997's "Anastasia". This was an animated musical adaptation of the story of Anastasia's fictional (not real) escape from Russia and how she tried to be recognized. The film often used wrong historical facts.

In "The Romanov Prophecy," a 2004 novel by Steve Berry, Anastasia and Alexei are saved by guards and taken away to the United States. There, they live under false names with a family paid by Felix Yusupov. In the novel, both children died in the 1920s because they became sick. However, before they died, Alexei married and had a son.

Anna Anderson

Anna Anderson (December 16, 1896 – February 12, 1984) was a woman who claimed she was Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. The real Anastasia had been murdered in Ekaterinburg with the rest of her immediate family on July 17,1918. Her remains have been found and extensively tested using DNA samples from Anastasia's family comparing them to Anderson. There was no match at all. Anderson attempted to kill herself in 1920 in Berlin, Germany. She was taken to a mental hospital. A short time later she began to tell her false story of escape to people there. Some people believed her. Most people did not. Her false claims were pushed for 70 years. Movies were made about her story. She married Jack Manahan and called herself Anastasia Manahan. They lived in Charlottesville, Virginia. Anna Anderson died in 1984.

Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1899–1918)

Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia ("Maria Nikolaevna Romanova"; Russian: Великая Княжна Мария Николаевна, – July 17, 1918) was the third daughter of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Tsarina Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse). After she was murdered in the Russian Revolution of 1917, she was canonized as a passion bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church.

When she lived, Maria was not old enough to be a Red Cross nurse like her sisters. Instead, she was patroness of a hospital and visited wounded soldiers. She was very interested in the lives of the soldiers, and had several innocent crushes on the young men she met. She wanted to marry and have a big family. She was known to be flirtaseous at a young age.

She was an older sister of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. Her sister Anastasia was famous for stories about her escape from the murder of the royal family for almost 90 years. In the 1990s, it was suggested that the grand duchess whose remains were not in the Romanov grave might be Maria. However, further remains were discovered in 2007, and DNA proved at last that the entire Imperial family had been murdered in 1918.

People described Maria as a pretty, flirtatious girl. She was plump, with light brown hair and big blue eyes that her family called "Marie's saucers". Her French teacher Pierre Gilliard said Maria was tall and healthy, with rosy cheeks. Tatiana Botkina thought Maria's eyes were "soft and gentle." When she was a baby, people compared her to one of Botticelli's angels. Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia called her "The Amiable (Good-hearted) Baby".

When she was young, Maria once ran away from her bath and ran naked (without clothes) all around the palace. Her Irish nurse, Margaretta Eager, who was talking about politics with a friend, did not even notice. "Fortunately, I arrived just at that moment, picked her up and carried her back to Miss Eagar," remembered her aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia. Her older sisters did not like to let Maria join in their games. They once even called Maria their "stepsister". This was because she was so good and never got into trouble, according to Margaretta Eagar. However, even the sweet Maria could be mischievous sometimes. Once, when she was young, she stole some biscuits from her mother's tea table. The governess and Alexandra wanted her to go to bed as a punishment, but Nicholas said no. He said, "I was always afraid (fearful) of the wings growing. I am glad to see she is only a human child." Eagar remarked that Maria loved her father deeply. She often tried to run away from the nursery to "go to Papa". When her father was ill with typhoid, Maria covered a small picture of him with kisses every night.

She was raised very simply. She shared a room with her sister Anastasia, where the walls were painted gray, and the ceiling was painted with butterflies. The furniture was simple and in white and green colors.

Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia

Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia (b. June 10, 1897, Russia) was a daughter of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna. She was a sister of Olga, Anastasia, Maria, and Tsarevich Alexei of Russia. Her friends said she was more beautiful than her sisters. She was a Red Cross nurse during World War I. She was practical and liked to help her mother. Her religion was Russian Orthodox. She spoke Russian, English and French fluently.

Tatiana was killed by Bolsheviks on July 17, 1918 with the rest of her family and some of their servants, during the Russian Revolution. Their mass grave was found later in Siberia after some speculation that one of her sisters, mainly presumed to be Anastasia, had escaped. Tatiana and her family were then buried in St. Petersburg, Russia on July 17, 1998. They were made saints by the Russian Orthodox Church in 2000.

Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia

Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia (Olga Nikolaevna Romanova) (; , November 16 after 1900 – July 17, 1918) was the oldest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, the last sovereign of Imperial Russia, and his wife Alexandra Fyodorovna.

Olga's future marriage was the subject of much speculation inside Russia while she was alive. There were stories about matches with Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, Crown Prince Carol of Romania, Edward, Prince of Wales, eldest son of Britain's George V, and with Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia. Olga wanted to marry a Russian and stay in her home country. During World War I, Olga nursed wounded soldiers at a military hospital until she became ill herself. After that, she managed administrative duties at the hospital.

Olga was murdered with her family on July 17, 1918 by the Bolshevik secret police. The Russian Orthodox Church canonized her as a passion bearer after her death. Later, many people falsely claimed to be surviving members of the royal family. A woman named Marga Boodts claimed to be Grand Duchess Olga, but she was not taken seriously. Historians believe that Olga was killed with her family at Ekaterinburg. Her remains were identified through DNA testing. They were buried in a funeral ceremony in 1998 at Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg with those of her parents and two of her sisters. 

Olga's sisters were Grand Duchesses Tatiana, Maria, and Anastasia. She also had a brother, Tsarevich Alexei of Russia. Olega's title ("Velikaya Knyazhna" Великая Княжна) is best translated as "Grand Princess". This meant that Olega, as an "Imperial Highness", was higher in rank than other Princesses in Europe who were "Royal Highnesses". "Grand Duchess" became the most well-known translation of the title into English from Russian. Olga's friends and family usually called her simply Olga Nikolaevna. They also called her "Olishka" or "Olya". Queen Victoria was her great-grandmother. Olega was very close to her sister Tatiana. They shared a room, dressed similarly, and were known as "The Big Pair". The younger sisters, Maria and Anastasia, were known as "The Little Pair".

Olega was known for her compassion and kindness from when she was young. But she also had a quick temper and often spoke what she thought plainly. Once, when she was a small child, she became impatient while posing for a portrait painter and told him, "You are a very ugly man and I don't like you one bit!" Pierre Gilliard, her French teacher, said that when he first saw Olga when she was 10 years old, she was "very fair, and with sparkling, mischievous examined me with a look which seemed from the first moment to be searching for the weak point in my armor, but there was something so pure and frank (truthful) about the child that one liked her straight off."

The Tsar's children lived very simply. They slept on hard camp cots without pillows when they were healthy. This tradition had been started in the rule of Catherine the Great when she first made her grandson Alexander do so. They took cold baths in the morning, and had to clean their rooms and do needlework. Most people living with them, including servants, usually called the Grand Duchess by her first name, Olega Nikolaevna, instead of her title or "Her Imperial Highness". However, once on a visit to a museum where state carriages were displayed, Olga ordered one of the servants to prepare the largest and most beautiful carriage for her daily drive. She was not obeyed. She also felt oldest children should be respected. When she was told the Biblical story of Joseph, she felt sorry for the older brothers instead of Joseph. She also sympathized with Goliath rather than David in the story of David and Goliath. Olga loved reading. Unlike her sisters, she also liked school work. Pierre Gilliard said that Olga had a very "quick brain", with "good reasoning powers" and "a very independent manner, and a gift for swift (quick) and entertaining (funny) repartee (replies)." She enjoyed reading about politics in newspapers. Olga also liked choosing books from what her mother read. When she was found reading a book before her mother had read it, Olga joked that her mother must wait until Olga had made sure that it was a proper book for her to read.

Physical compression

Physical compression means that a material under compressive stress reduces its volume.

There are different uses of compression in physics and engineering. 
By compression it is possible to measure mechanical properties of materiels such as compressive strength or modulus of elasticity. Scientists do this with press machines.

Compression is also used in engines, for example in the Diesel engine as in any internal combustion engine and in the steam engine.

Funeral Blues

Funeral Blues is a poem written in 1936 by W. H. Auden.

"Funeral Blues" is a simple poem about death, isolation (loneliness), emptiness and longing. The death of a lover may or may not be a literal event (actually happened). The poem is also about the end of a romantic relationship with somebody other than the person's spouse/partner. In four stanzas it moves from the time before the funeral (Stop all the clocks, Silence the pianos...), during the funeral itself (Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come...), after the funeral (He was my North, my South...), and the loneliness and grief that comes with it.

Parsley is a fresh flavored bright green herb. It used on food as a garnish and as a seasoning in soups,sauces and salads. Some people eat parsley to get their breath to smell better. Parsley can be easily grown in gardens, as well as inside the home, wherever there is plenty of indirect sunlight. Parsley needs good, light soil, good drainage and frequent watering to thrive indoors. To harvest parsely, cut the most mature stalks near the base that are still bright green. New shoots will grow for some time from the base of an established plant. Parsley is extraordinarily rich in vitamins C and A, minerals (especially potassium),beta-carotene, folate and dietary fiber.

Édith Piaf (aka. "La Môme Piaf") (December 19, 1915 – October 11, 1963) was one of France's most loved singers. Her real name is Édith Giovanna Gassion. She became a national icon. Her music was an image of her tragic life. Piaf was known for singing ballads in a heartbreaking voice. 

As child at her grandmothers‘ in Normandy, she suffered from keratitis, but
1925 - 10 A pilgrimage to Lisieux in the Normandy honoring Saint Theresa of Lisieux / (Sainte Thérèse de l'Enfant-Jésus) , and the intense devoutness of the family resulted in a miraculous healing, Édith said.
1930 – 15 Her manager fand her stage name „la môme Piaf“ or ‚la Môme‘,‘ Édith Piaf‘,or ‚Piaf‘.
She was small (1,47 meter tall) and puny but scharp and lively like a chaffinch. She always wore a black dress on the stage.
She sang first in Pigalle, then in "Le Gerny", the nightclub of Louis Leplée near the Champs-Élysées.
She met Raymond Asso (1901-1968) and Marguerite Monnot (1903-1961), who wrote and composed her best songs; she stroke up an acquaintance with actor Maurice Chevalier.
1948 – 32 The love of Piaf's life, the boxer Marcel Cerdan, middleweight champion of the world, died in a plane crash in October 1949, in the Azores, while flying from Paris to New York City to meet her. 
1952 – 36 Piaf married Jacques Pills in 1952 (her matron of honour was Marlene Dietrich).She divorced him in 1956. In 1962, she wed Théo Sarapo (Theophanis Lamboukas), a Greek hairdresser who was 20 years her junior. 
She suffered from different illnesses during her life, especially after several car crashes.
1963 – 47 Piaf died of liver cancer at Plascassier, near Grasse (Département Alpes-Maritimes), on 10 October 1963. 

Among her most famous songs are ""Mon légionnaire"" (1936), ""Le fanion de la Légion"" (1936), ""La vie en rose"" (1946), ""Hymne à l'amour"" (1949), ""Padam... Padam..."" (1951), ""l'Accordéoniste"" (1955), ""Les amants d'un jour"" (1956),""La foule"" (1957), ""Milord"" (1959) and ""Non, je ne regrette rien"" (1960). 

Although she was denied a solemn funeral mass, her funeral procession from her residence, Boulevard Lannes (Paris, XVI arr.) drew tens of thousands of mourners onto the streets of Paris, that caused a huge traffic jam. The ceremony at the cemetery ‚Le Père-Lachaise‘ (Paris, XX arr.) was attended by more than 100,000 fans.

A weed is a plant that someone thinks is bad, because it is growing in the wrong place. Trees are not often called weeds, only smaller plants.

Someone may grow a plant because it has beautiful flowers, but other people may think that this plant is a weed for some reason. This may be for one of these reasons:

If someone is farming a plant and it then moves outside the farm, the plant may then be called a weed.

Some plants are very hard to stop once they start growing. These are called invasive weeds. 

Weed is also a name for any wild plant, one that people do not use for anything.

Ternopil is a city in western Ukraine. It is also the administrative centre of the Ternopil region. The city has about 245,000 inhabitants (2004) and is situated on the Siret River.

The city was part of the Austrian Habsburg Empire from 1772 until 1918, and it belonged to Poland before 1772. When the Austrain empire fell in 1918, Turnopil beccame part of the short-lived ZUNR (Western Ukrainian National Republic). After heavy battles between Polish troops and Ukrainian Galician Army troops, the city was occupied by Poland in 1920. However, it was only part of Poland for less than 20 years, and in September 1939, it was taken by Soviet troops and annexed to the USSR. Ternopil became part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, it became a part of Independent Ukraine.

Cremation is the act of burning a body after it has died. Cremation is a popular option to dispose of (get rid of) a body instead of burying it. The place where cremations take place is called a crematorium or crematory.

Cremated remains (also called "ashes") are returned to the person's family. The family then has a few options of what to do with the remains. Sometimes the cremated person has thought about what they want to be done with their remains and have shared their desires with their family.

Cremated remains can be kept in a container called an urn, thrown into the air or water of a place that was special to the cremated person, or buried in the ground. These are the most popular choices of what to do with remains. There are also other, less common, options of how to dispose of the remains. Some examples of ways to scatter the remains are: through fireworks, shot from guns, or dropped from an airplane or hot air balloon. Remains can even be sent into space or turned into a diamond. The latter can be done because humans and diamonds are both made largely from carbon.

The saying "bless you" is commonly used when someone sneezes. This is done because there is a tradition carried by the superstition that a person's soul will come out of their mouth and nose if they sneeze. People believed that saying "God bless you," or "bless you" for short, would make the soul go back inside. They are wishing the person good luck so that their soul is able to come back. 

People also think that if unusual good luck or a miracle comes to them, it is a blessing. For example, if some people wanted a child badly but are having difficulty conceiving, it could be considered a blessing from God if they end up having a child.

To "give your blessing" to someone is to give permission to them. For example, a man can ask his girlfriend's parents' for their blessing before he asks her to marry him.

Blessings are often thought of as the opposite of a curse.

He became a member of the rock band "Mefisto" in the 1950s. Later, he composed music for the "Laterna Magica" theatre in Prague and for many Czech singers. In 1969 he wrote "Lady Carneval" for Karel Gott, a major Czech pop star. Svoboda wrote a total of 80 songs for him.

Svoboda composed TV scores for the German channel ZDF for over 30 years. He wrote the scores to many TV series in the 1970s that a whole generation of Europeans grew up with. Some examples of these TV series are Vicky the Viking, Maya the Bee and The Wonderful Adventures of Nils.

Angular momentum

In physics, the angular momentum of an object rotating about some reference point is the measure of the extent to which the object will continue to rotate about that point when acted upon by an external torque.

In particular, if a point mass rotates about an axis, then the angular momentum with respect to a point on the axis is related to the mass of the object, the velocity and the distance of the mass to the axis.

Angular momentum is important in physics because it is a conserved quantity: a system's angular momentum stays constant unless an external torque acts on it. Torque is the rate at which angular momentum is transferred in or out of the system. When a rigid body rotates, its resistance to a change in its rotational motion is measured by its moment of inertia.

The equation for torque is:

τ = r x F 

where, F is the force vector, and r is the vector from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is acting. 

Angular momentum is an important concept in both physics and engineering, with numerous applications. For example, the kinetic energy stored in a massive rotating object such as a flywheel is proportional to the square of the angular momentum.

Conservation of angular momentum also explains many phenomena in nature.

Axle

An axle is a central shaft for a rotating wheel or gear. In some cases the axle may be fixed in position with a bearing or bushing sitting inside the hole in the wheel or gear to allow the wheel or gear to rotate around the axle. In other cases the wheel or gear may be fixed to the axle, with bearings or bushings provided at the mounting points where the axle is supported. Sometimes, especially on bicycles, the latter type is referred to as a spindle.

Axles are an important structural component of a wheeled vehicle. The axles maintain the position of the wheels relative to each other and to the vehicle body. Since for most vehicles the wheels are the only part touching the ground, the axles must bear the weight of the vehicle plus any cargo.

<doc id="49107" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49107" title="Transmission (mechanics)">
Transmission (mechanics)

In mechanics, a transmission or gearbox means gears working together. The most common transmission is the transmission in a car. 

In a car, the engine makes the crankshaft spin. The crankshaft makes the transmission's gears spin, which spin some more parts, which make the wheels spin. But the wheels do not spin as fast as the engine makes the crankshaft spin. That is because the gears are made to slow down the spinning. The gears also give the spinning more force (or to be more scientifically exact, more torque), so the wheels can make the entire car move.

A transmission has some gears that change the torque more than other gears. That is why a transmission has a first gear, second gear, third gear, and sometimes more gears. There is also a reverse gear and neutral. An automatic transmission shifts between gears by itself (except reverse gear, and a parking gear). A manual transmission needs the driver to decide when to shift gears. Manual transmission is also called standard transmission. This is confusing because almost all cars in the U.S. have automatic transmission. In other words, "standard" transmission is unusual in the U.S., not standard.

Not all transmissions are in cars. For example, bicycles have transmissions. You can see the gears, so it is easier to see how it works.

Wristwatch

The wristwatch (also called a "watch") is a small clock or timepiece that is attached to a person's wrist with a strap. Watches display the time and sometimes the day, date, month and year. In 1524, Peter Henlein created the first pocket watch. Before the 1900s, most watches were pocket watches which were carried in a pocket and attached to a chain.

Before the 1970s, all watches had a numbered dial with a rotating hour hand and a longer minute hand. Since the 1970s, digital watches have been available. Digital watches have small computers inside to keep the time. Instead of having a dial and hands, a digital watch shows the time as a number (e.g., 10:30 AM).

"This article is about the structural behavior. For other meanings see Bending (disambiguation)."

In engineering mechanics, bending (also known as flexure) characterizes the behavior of a structural element subjected to a lateral load. A structural element subjected to bending is known as a beam. 

A closet rod sagging under the weight of clothes on clothes hangers is an example of a beam experiencing bending.

Torsion (mechanics)

In solid mechanics, torsion is the twisting of an object that is result of an applied torque. In circular sections, the resultant shearing stress is perpendicular to the radius.

The shear stress at a point on a shaft is:
"T" is the applied torque, "r" is the distance from the center of rotation, and "J" is the polar moment of inertia.

The angle of twist can be found by using:

Polar moment of inertia

Polar moment of inertia is a measure of an object's ability to resist torsion. It is required to calculate the twist of an object subjected to a torque. It is analogous to the area moment of inertia, which characterizes an object's ability to resist bending and is required to calculate displacement. 

The larger the polar moment of inertia, the less the beam will twist, when subjected to a given torque.

The "polar moment of inertia" must not be confused with the "moment of inertia", which characterizes an object's angular acceleration due to a torque.

See also moment (physics).

Burial is the act of placing an object or human into the ground. The burial of objects can also be called interment. The burial of dead humans can also be called inhumation.

Human bodies are usually buried in a cemetery. It is common practice in many places to put bodies into a coffin and place the coffin into a grave. The grave is then usually marked with a headstone so that people know who is there and can visit them.

In the past, often during times of war, many bodies have been placed into the same grave without coffins. This is called a "mass burial" or a "mass grave".

The Gila monster () is a venomous desert lizard. The Gila monster’s name comes from the Gila River in Arizona, USA.

The Gila monster is heavy and slow for a lizard. It can grow up to 2 feet(60 cm) long. Its skin looks like beads and is black, pink, orange, and yellow. It looks a lot like the Mexican beaded lizard, which is its closest relative.

The Gila monster can bite quickly and hold on tightly, but it does not kill humans. It usually eats small rodents, young birds and eggs. The lizard chews its prey, injecting its venom (poison) into the animal through teeth in its lower jaw. The Gila monster can also store food in its tail.

In 2005 a medicine to treat diabetes was made from the Gila monster’s saliva. Some people who take it call it "lizard spit" as a joke.

Duel

A duel is a fight between two people who have similar deadly weapons and have agreed to a set of rules before the fight takes place. The fight is usually about a matter of honor. The goal of a duel is not usually to kill the opponent but to restore the honor of the man who declared the duel. Duels are not official laws, they are carried out by individuals.

Duels were practiced from the 15th to 20th century in Western societies. For example, in 1804 in the United States the politicians Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton had a duel. Since the American Civil War, all U.S. states have criminalized dueling, with punishments for dueling ranging from not being allowed to run for public office to the death penalty. Dueling was outlawed because groups against dueling formed and were successful.

Duels could be fought with swords or pistols.

The person who felt offended or dishonored had to "challenge" his opponent to a duel. This was usually done by throwing his glove down in front of the opponent or by hitting him in the face with a glove. Each person had to then find a person to be his "second". The job of the seconds was to choose a place to duel and to decide whether or not the weapons were equal. 

The person who declared the duel got to choose when the duel would be finished. Common endings to duels were:

The Castle (movie)

The Castle is a 1997 Australian movie which was popular in Australia. Some people outside Australia did not understand some of the humour. "The Castle" starred Michael Caton and Anne Tenney and was filmed in Melbourne, Australia.

"The Castle" was made in 11 days for about AUD$800,000. Some people have said that "The Castle" is a very simple movie because it was filmed cheaply and quickly. However, fans of the movie generally appreciate it because it is a good movie that was made on a low budget.

The story is about the Kerrigan family, who have been living in their home—their "castle"-- for years. Their house is next to the local airport. The airport wants the Kerrigans to move so that they can build a new building on the Kerrigans' land. Darryl Kerrigan is the father. He does not want to leave his house, so he fights the airport in court. At first he loses in court because his lawyer is not very good. Then he meets a very good lawyer (a Queen's Counsel). The Queen's Counsel argues very well and the Kerrigans can keep their house.

"The Castle" is funny to Australians because the movie is about ordinary people. They are not rich or stylish, but they are good people. Australians like the idea of "the little Aussie battler", someone who is hard-working even when life is tough. The movie title is named for the English saying, which is said many time during the movie, "A man's home is his castle." The movie also talks about the land rights movement of the Australian Aborigines. Darryl Kerrigan compares his problem to the Aboriginals problems about land. The movie talks about famous Australian Constitutional Law Cases, like Mabo and the Tasmanian Dams Case.


It is common in Australia to humorously quote lines from ""The Castle"". Some of the most popular of these are:

Morality

Morality is the concept of doing the right thing. Morals are basic guidelines for living.
Many people have written about ways of choosing what the right thing is. Some believe that there is an objective (true even if you do not agree with it) morality, often thinking it was set out by God or another similar being; others think that morality is subjective (that what is good or bad is your choice).

People can learn morals from religion, parents, friends, school, or reading a book. People that teach or follow morals are called moralists.

It can also be a lesson that someone learns in a book or story. It is usually one line at the end of the story ("The moral of this story is..."). Fables are stories with a moral. 

The opposites of "moral" is "immoral", meaning the wrong thing to do. "Amoral" means something that is not related to morality, or has no morally good or bad aspect to it. It is the same as "morally neutral".

Maria Sharapova (born 19 April 1987) is a Russian tennis player. She was born in Nyagan, Western Siberia. Her parents had moved from Belarus to protect themselves from the Chernobyl nuclear accident. The Sharapov family moved again in 1989, when Maria became interested in tennis, when watching her father play, and played tennis with a second-hand racquet. She would practise tennis by hitting the tennis ball against the wall every day, and her dad soon noticed that she was very good at the sport.
Maria's tennis coaches told the Sharapovs that they should move to Moscow, Russia, to get better training. The Sharapovs moved again, from Moscow, to follow Maria's coach, Martina Navratilova's advice, to move to the United States.

There was a problem, though. Sharapova's mother, Yelena, could not get a visa to go to the United States. Meanwhile, Maria and her dad tried to get Maria to go to a famous sports school, and they also had to learn English. Maria showed so much talent that soon, she got a full scholarship to attend the school. At first though, Maria's dad had pay for Maria to stay at the famous school, doing all sorts of jobs so that they could be able to pay for the school.

Sharapova trained harder and harder. She was videotaped when practicing, and her every move was recorded. Then, she would watch the videos with her coaches to watch her form, emotions, and expressions.

She began to win tournaments and many people started to notice her. Her games improved, and Maria gained more fans.

She has won 22 titles in her career, including three Grand Slam championships: Wimbledon in 2004, US Open in 2006 and Australian Open in 2008.

In Russia, female surnames are changed so that their gender can be identified, so Sharapov becomes Sharapova.
