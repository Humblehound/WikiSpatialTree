Template:Reflist/doc

Use this template to create a reference list in small font for an article. Note that there is no consensus that small font size should always be used for all references; when normal-sized font is more appropriate on an article, use codice_1 instead.

If used with no parameters, it will produce a reference list with a single column.

The font size should reduce to 90% for most browsers, but may appear to show at 100% for Internet Explorer and possibly other browsers. Reflist uses one CSS entry in to set the font size:


Editors may over-ride this settings by placing entries in their personal CSS.

Using codice_3 will create a two-column reference list, and codice_3 will create a three-column list. Three-column lists are inaccessible to users with smaller/laptop monitors and should be avoided.

Using codice_3 will allow the browser to automatically choose the number of columns based on the width of the web browser. Choose a column width that is appropriate for the average width of the references on the page.

Multiple columns are generated by using CSS3, which is still in development; thus only browsers that properly support the multi-column selector will show multiple columns.


If you cannot abide multiple columns, you may add the following to your personal CSS file (after if you have not already done so) to force single-column display while logged in to your account:

This will normally have to be added to your ; if you are using a different skin, look in the "Personal CSS" column of the table to find the right file.

The <nowiki><ref></nowiki> tag now supports named groups so that separate lists may be created— see .

The general format for the reference tag would be:

And for the reflist:

For example, to create a separate format notes list, the references would be formatted as:

To create the formatted list:

While any number of groups can be created and listed, they should be kept to a minimum.

This template (or codice_1 by any means, for that matter) should not be used multiple times in the same page with the same value for the codice_7 parameter. But if this is for some reason required, at least one parameter must be passed to every invocation of the template for correct output. For example, use codice_1 instead of simply codice_1.

Exogenetic process

The exogenetic processes are the processes that shape the land by forces coming on or above the Earth's surface (exogenetic forces). 
Many of these forces are as a result of other bodies in space. For example, the Moon causes tides in the Earth's oceans and other big bodies of water. Impacts from comets and meteoroids change the surface of the Earth. When they strike the Earth, they create craters which are holes, which can be very big or small, in the ground. Radiation from the Sun can cause aurorae, which are lights that can be seen at night near the poles.

An example of an exogenetic process that is not as a result of bodies in space is erosion. Erosion happens as a result of wind, water, ice, or people, animals, or plants digging in the earth.

Exogenetic processes are differ from endogenetic ones in that endogenetic forces come from within the Earth (like a volcano).

Oblate spheroid

An oblate spheroid is like a sphere, but the distance from pole to pole is less than than the distance around the equator (middle). This gives it a slightly flattened shape. An example would be a Skittles or a M&M sweet. (A sphere has the same distance between every point on its surface to its center.)

Many planets, including the Earth and Saturn are oblate spheroids.

Mathematicians define an oblate spheroid as a rotationally symmetric ellipsoid having a polar axis shorter than the diameter of the equatorial circle whose plane bisects it. In contrast, prolate spheroids have a polar axis longer than the distance around the equator. Both oblate and prolate spheroids are examples of ellipsoids.

<doc id="196645" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=196645" title="Venice and Dalmatia">
Venice and Dalmatia

Venice and Dalmatia were an Italian city-state and an eastern adriatic region very much related from the Middle Ages until the 19th century.

Venice influenced Dalmatia commercially since the times of Charlemagne. But only at the end of the first millennium the Republic of Venice started to conquest Dalmatia.

Indeed, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Illyrian towns on the dalmatian coast continued to speak Latin and their language evolved relatively independent from other Romance languages, progressing toward a regional variant and finally to a distinct language called "Dalmatian language".

The earliest reference on the language dates from the 10th century and it is estimated that about 50,000 people spoke it at that time (according to the linguist Matteo Bartoli).

The Dalmatian language is an extinct Romance language that was spoken along the eastern Adriatic in the Dalmatian coast from Fiume (Rijeka) as far south as Kotor (Cattaro) in Montenegro.

The Dalmatian speakers lived mainly in the coastal towns of Zadar, Trogir, Split, Dubrovnik and Kotor ("Zara, Traù, Spalato, Ragusa" and "Cattaro" in Italian), each of these cities having a local dialect, and also on the islands of Krk, Cres and Rab ("Veglia, Cherso" and "Arbe")

Almost every city developed its own dialect, but the most important dialects we have information on are the "Vegliot" a northern dialect, spoken on the island of Krk ("Veglia" in Italian, "Vikla" in Dalmatian) and the "Ragusan"', a southern dialect, spoken at Dubrovnik ("Ragusa" in both Italian and Dalmatian).

The dialect of Zara disappeared because of the strong Venetian influence while the two other dialects due even to the assimilation by Slavic language speakers.

We know about the dalmatian dialect of Ragusa from two letters, from 1325 and 1397, and other medieval texts, which show a language influenced heavily by Venetian. The available sources include hardly 260 Ragusan words. Surviving words include "pen" (bread), "teta" (father), "chesa" (house) and "fachir" (to do), which were quoted by an Italian, Fillipo Diversi, the head of school of Ragusa in the 1430s.

The "Republic of Ragusa" had at one time an important fleet, but its influence decreased. We know that the language was in trouble in the face of Croatian expansion, as the Ragusan Senate decided that all debates had to be held in "lingua veteri ragusea" (ancient Ragusan language) and the use of the "lingua sclava" (Croatian) was forbidden. Nevertheless, in the 16th century, Ragusan fell out of use and became extinct.

Other languages influenced the Ddalmatian language, but without erasing its Latin roots (superstrates): the Slavs, then the Republic of Venice. Several cities of the regions have Italian names, and other mostly the romanized Illyrian ones (like Zara, Spalato, etc..)

The oldest preserved documents written in Dalmatian are some 13th century inventories, in the Ragusan dialect. A letter of the 14th century from Zara (Zadar) shows strong Venetian influence, which was also the cause of its extinction soon after.

The Christian schism was an important factor in the history of Dalmatia. While the Croatian-held branch of the Catholic Church in Nin was under Pope's jurisdiction, they still used the Slavic liturgy. Both the Latin population of the cities and the Holy See preferred the Latin liturgy, which created tensions between different dioceses. 

The great schism between Eastern and Western Christianity of 1054 further intensified the rift between the coastal cities and the hinterland, with many of the Slavs in the hinterland preferring the Eastern Orthodoxy. Areas of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina also had an indigenous "Bosnian Church" which was often mistaken for "Bogomils".

The Latin influence in Dalmatia was increased and the Byzantine practices were further suppressed on the general synods of 1059-1060, 1066, 1075-1076 and on other local synods, notably by demoting the bishopric of Nin, installing the archbishoprics of Spalatum (Split) and Dioclea (Montenegro), and explicitly forbidding use of any liturgy other than Greek or Latin.

Dalmatia never attained a political or racial unity and never formed as a "nation", but it achieved a remarkable development of art, science and literature. Politically, the neolatin Dalmatian city-states were often isolated and compelled to either fall back on the Venetian Republic for support, or tried to make it on their own.

The geographical position of the Dalmatian city states suffices to explain the relatively small influence exercised by Byzantine culture throughout the six centuries (535-1102) during which Dalmatia was part of the Eastern empire. Towards the close of this period Byzantine rule tended more and more to become merely nominal, while the influence of the Republic of Venice increased.

The medieval Dalmatia had still included much of the hinterland covered by the old Roman province of Dalmatia. However, the toponym of "Dalmatia" started to shift more towards including only the coastal, Adriatic areas, rather than the mountains inland. By the 15th century, the word "Herzegovina" would be introduced, marking the shrink of the borders of Dalmatia to the narrow littoral area where was spoken the Dalmatian language (that was being assimilated into the venetian language).

In the thirteenth century the Republic of Venice took definitive control of the Montenegro coast and created the "Albania Veneta".

As the city states gradually lost all protection by Byzantium, being unable to unite in a defensive league hindered by their internal dissensions, they had to turn to either Venice or Hungary for support. Each of the two political factions had support within the Dalmatian city states, based mostly on economic reasons.

The Venetians, to whom the Dalmatians were already bound by language and culture, could afford to concede liberal terms as its main goal was to prevent the development of any dangerous political or commercial competitor on the eastern Adriatic.
The seafaring community in Dalmatia looked to Venice as mistress of the Adriatic. In return for protection, the cities often furnished a contingent to the army or navy of their suzerain, and sometimes paid tribute either in money or in kind. Arbe (Rab), for example, annually paid ten pounds of silk or five pounds of gold to Venice.
Hungary, on the other hand, defeated the last Croat king in 1097 and laid claim on all lands of the Croatian noblemen since the treaty of 1102. King Coloman of Hungary proceeded to conquer Dalmatia in 1102-1105.
The farmers and the merchants who traded in the interior favoured Hungary as their most powerful neighbour on land that affirmed their municipal privileges. 
Subject to the royal assent they might elect their own chief magistrate, bishop and judges. Their Roman law remained valid. They were even permitted to conclude separate alliances. No alien, not even a Hungarian, could reside in a city where he was unwelcome; and the man who disliked Hungarian dominion could emigrate with all his household and property. In lieu of tribute, the revenue from customs was in some cases shared equally by the king, chief magistrate, bishop and municipality.

These rights and the analogous privileges granted by Venice were, however, too frequently infringed. Hungarian garrisons were being quartered on unwilling towns, while Venice interfered with trade, the appointment of bishops, or the tenure of communal domains. Consequently the Dalmatians remained loyal only while it suited their interests, and insurrections frequently occurred. Even in Zara four outbreaks are recorded between 1180 and 1345, although Zadar was treated with special consideration by its Venetian masters, who regarded its possession as essential to their maritime ascendancy.

The once rival Romanic and Slavic population eventually started contributing to a common civilization, and Ragusa (Dubrovnik) was the primary example of this. By the 13th century, the councilmen from ragusan names were mixed, and in the 15th century the ragusan literature was even written in the Slavic language (from which Croatian language is directly descended), and the city was often called by its Slavic name, Dubrovnik. Only in 1918 Ragusa was called officially "Dubrovnik", with the creation of Yugoslavia.

The doubtful allegiance of the Dalmatians tended to protract the struggle between Venice and Hungary, which was further complicated by internal discord due largely to the spread of the "Bogomil heresy", and by many outside influences.

The cities of Zara (Zadar), Spalato (Split), Trau (Trogir) and Ragusa (Dubrovnik) and the surrounding territories each changed hands several times between Venice, Hungary and the Byzantium during the 12th century.

In 1202, the armies of the Fourth Crusade rendered assistance to Venice by occupying Zadar for it. In 1204 the same army conquered Byzantium and finally eliminated the Eastern Empire from the list of contenders on Dalmatian territory.

The early 13th century was marked by a decline in external hostilities. The Dalmatian cities started accepting foreign sovereignty (mainly of the Republic of Venice) but eventually they reverted to their previous desire for independence. The Mongol invasion severely impaired Hungary, so much that in 1241, the king Bela IV had to take refuge in Dalmatia (in the Klis fortress). The Mongols attacked the Dalmatian cities for the next few years but eventually withdrew.

The Croats were no longer regarded by the city folk as a hostile people, in fact the power of certain Croatian magnates, notably the counts Šubić of Bribir, was from time to time supreme in the northern districts (in the period between 1295 and 1328).

In 1346, Dalmatia was struck by the Black Death. The economic situation was also poor, and the cities became more and more dependent on Venice.

Stephen Tvrtko, the founder of the "Bosnian kingdom", was able in 1389 to annex the Adriatic littoral between Cattaro and Sebenico (Šibenik), and even claimed control over the northern coast up to Fiume (Rijeka) except for the Venetian-ruled Zara (Zadar), and his own independent ally, Ragusa (Dubrovnik). This was only temporary, as the Hungarians and the Venetians continued their struggle over Dalmatia as soon as Tvrtko died in 1391.

An internal struggle of Hungary, between King Sigismund and the Neapolitan house of Anjou, also reflected on Dalmatia: in the early 15th century, all Dalmatian cities welcomed the Neapolitan fleet except for Dubrovnik (Ragusa). The Bosnian duke Hrvoje controlled Dalmatia for the Angevins, but later switched loyalty to Sigismund.

Over the period of twenty years, this struggle weakened the Hungarian influence. In 1409, Ladislaus of Naples sold his "rights" over Dalmatia to Venice for 100,000 "Ducats". Venice gradually took over most of Dalmatia by 1420. In 1437, Sigismund recognized Venetian rule over Dalmatia in return for 100,000 Ducats. The city of Omiš yielded to Venice in 1444, and only Ragusa (Dubrovnik) preserved temporarily its freedom. 

The rule of Venice on most of Dalmatia will last nearly four centuries (1420 - 1797).

During the Venetian rule in Dalmatia from 1420 to 1797 the number of Orthodox Serbs in Dalmatia was increased by numerous migrations.

An interval of peace ensued, but meanwhile the Ottoman advance continued. 

Hungary was itself assailed by the Turks, and could no longer afford to try to control Dalmatia. Christian kingdoms and regions in the east fell one by one, Constantinople in 1453, Serbia in 1459, neighbouring Bosnia in 1463, and Herzegovina in 1483. Thus the Venetian and Ottoman frontiers met and border wars were incessant.

Dubrovnik sought safety in friendship with the invaders, and in one particular instance, actually sold two small strips of its territory (Neum and Sutorina) to the Ottomans in order to prevent land access from the Venetian territory.

In 1508 the hostile "League of Cambrai" compelled Venice to withdraw its garrison for home service, and after the overthrow of Hungary in 1526 the Turks were able easily to conquer the greater part of Dalmatia by 1537. The peace of 1540 left only the maritime cities to Venice, the interior forming a Turkish province, governed from the fortress of Klis by a "Sanjakbeg" (an administrator with military powers).

Christian Croats from the neighbouring lands now thronged to the towns, outnumbering the Romanic population even more, and making their language the primary one. The pirate community of the "Uskoks" had originally been a band of these fugitives, especially near Segna (Senj); its exploits contributed to a renewal of war between Venice and Turkey (1571-1573). An extremely curious picture of contemporary manners is presented by the Venetian agents, whose reports on this war resemble some knightly chronicle of the Middle Ages, full of single combats, tournaments and other chivalrous adventures. They also show clearly that the Dalmatian levies far surpassed the Italian mercenaries in skill and courage. Many of these troops served abroad; at the Battle of Lepanto, for example, in 1571, a Dalmatian squadron assisted the allied fleets of Spain, Venice, Austria and the Papal States to crush the Turkish navy.

The continental bits of Dalmatia were under Ottoman rule, parts of the Viyalet of Bosnia or the Klis Sanjak. The desolated areas of the Knin Frontier and Bukovica were inhabited by Orthodox Serbs from Bosnia, while the Albania veneta received constant Serb migrations from Herzegovina and Montenegro. The Serbs formed one quarter of Dalmatia's population in the 16th century. They had absolute majority in the Knin Frontier, Bukovica and the Cattaro area. The Ottomans have resettled this populace to create a living defence towards the territories of the Venetian Republic. A great portion of this population fled to Venetian land and gladly fought against the Ottomans. The number of Serbs in Venetian Dalmatia rapidly increased during the War of Crete in 1645 - 1669 and the Great Viennese War in 1683 - 1699, after which the "Peace of Karlowitz" gave the whole of Dalmatia and coastal Montenegro (from Sutorina to Cattaro) to the Venetian Republic. After the Venetian-Turkish war of 1714-1718, Venetian territorial gains were confirmed by the 1718 "Treaty of Passarowitz". The number of Dalmatian Serbs remained between "20%" and "25%" by the end of Venetian rule, while the venetian speaking population in the Dalmatian cities and islands increased with colonists from north-east Italy. 

The Serbian peasant population of infertile Upper Dalmatia was freed of "Feudal bonds", according that they fight wars for the Venetian Republic. The Serbs living in urban area of cities in Dalmatia were much wealthier. The Serbs in Dalmatia with Boka have had strong national and religious determination through numerous old monasteries as beacons of culture and faith. Such were the early 14th century Krupa, Krka and Dragović monasteries in the Knin Frontier and Bukovica. The Serbs in the area of Cattaro (Kotor) had much more cultural advancement due to the nearby Cetinje capital area, and the Venetians had to fall back from influencing the religious life of people there. 

Dalmatia was the largest Europe's concentration of Roman Catholic Bishops, Priesthood, Churches, Monasteries and religious institutions. The Catholic Bishops controlled the Orthodox Episcopy in Dalmatia by naming the Eastern Othodox Christian Episcopes themselves. 

Dalmatia experienced a period of intense economic and cultural growth in the 18th century, given how trade routes with the hinterland were reestablished in peace. Christians that noticeably migrated from the Ottoman-held territory into the Dalmatian cities converted from Orthodoxy to Catholicism. 

Because the Venetians were able to reclaim some of the inland territories in the north during the Turkish wars, the region of Dalmatia was no longer restricted to the coastline and the islands. However, the Venetian influence wasn't as strong in the former southern Dalmatia, meaning that the toponym did not extend inland into areas of Herzegovina or Montenegro. 

This period was abruptly interrupted with the fall of the Venetian republic in 1797.

Napoleon united for the last time Dalmatia and Venice in his "Kingdom of Italy" in 1805. After his fall Venice followed the history of Italy with the Risorgimento, while Dalmatia was aggregated to the Austro-hungarian Empire.

Viscosity index

Viscosity index or VI is measure of the temperature at which a lubricating oil works properly. The VI scale goes from 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst, and 100 being the best. New products are now better than when the scale was first made, so some new products have scores as high as 400.

Lubricating oil is meant to reduce friction between two surfaces. If it is too viscous the oil will be thick and sticky and need too much energy to keep the parts moving. If the oil is too thin, then the parts will rub together and create friction. What is needed is an oil that has just the right amount of viscosity to keep the two surfaces apart. Oil becomes less viscous as the temperature goes up. In an automobile engine, the oil needs to be viscous at a range of temperatures. It needs to work when the engine is first started and is cold, and keep working when the engine gets very hot, perhaps as much as 200 °C. The best oils, with a high viscosity index score, will keep their viscosity the same across the temperature range.

The scale was made up by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE).

WWE Breaking Point

Breaking Point was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which took place on September 13, 2009 at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It contained wrestlers from the Smackdown, ECW, and RAW brands. The name of the event was voted by fans via WWE's official website. Breaking Point was chosen over Submission Sunday, Total Submission, and Submit & Quit.
Breaking Point contained seven professional wrestling matches, with the three main event matches being held under submission rules. The event involved wrestlers from all three Brands, Raw, WWE SmackDown and ECW. The wrestlers portrayed either a good guy or a bad guy as they followed a series of events which led to a wrestling match or a series of wrestling matches.

On the August 24, 2009 edition of WWE Raw, the main event for the Raw brand was announced, it was to be a rematch from the previous nights SummerSlam PPV, Randy Orton would again defend the WWE Championship against John Cena. Due to the controversy surrounding the previous nights match, which involved the match being restarted due to a disqualification, count-out and Orton's use of illegal leverage.

Vince McMahon granted Cena a rematch as a result of Orton's actions, in a response to the interference from Brett DiBiase at SummerSlam, McMahon stated if anyone were to interfere on Orton's behalf he would lose the WWE Championship. The Championship was defended in an "I Quit" match, where the opponent is won by making the opponent say "I Quit".

After winning the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam, it was announced CM Punk would defend the Championship the following week on the August 28, 2009 (taped August 25, 2009) edition against Jeff Hardy and the winner would face The Undertaker at Breaking Point in a Submission match, where the only way to win is by making your opponent Submit.

On the August 24, 2009 edition of WWE Raw, the Guest host for the night was weltherweight boxing champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr. who previously had a match with The Big Show at WrestleMania XXIV in 2008. Due to lingering bitterness from their WrestleMania match, Mayweather announced an exhibition match between Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Mark Henry versus Unified Tag Team Champions Big Show and Chris Jericho, with an added stipulation that if MVP and Henry won they would face Show and Jericho for the Unified Tag Team Championship at Breaking Point. During the match MVP and Henry gained their chance when Mayweather handed MVP brass knuckles to knock Jericho out and pin Jericho for the win.

On the July 27, 2009 edition of Raw, to decide the opponent for the current WWE Champion Randy Orton at Night of Champions, a "beat the clock" challenge was set up, Triple H had to defeat his opponent Cody Rhodes in under a set time of 6 minutes and 49 seconds set by Mark Henry. Triple H was unsuccessful in his attempt, this match was followed by Rhodes with assistance from The Legacy team member Ted DiBiase beating down Triple H. This event led to Triple H seeking help from Shawn Michaels to reform the group, D-Generation X (DX), to face and beat Rhodes and DiBiase at SummerSlam. Following the weeks of SummerSlam DX was continuously beat down by The Legacy which resulted in an announcement on WWE.com that the two teams would face at Breaking Point, in a Submissions Count Anywhere match.

In Your House was a pay-per-view (PPV) series made by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).

The original idea was in months where the WWF wasn't producing a major PPV event (WrestleMania, King of the Ring, SummerSlam, Survivor Series, and Royal Rumble which ran for three hours) they would produce a two hour PPV event for a lower price of $19.95.

When World Championship Wrestling (WCW) started producing three hour PPV's on a monthly basis, the WWF was forced to drop the concept.

The events were numbered numerically (example: In Your House #1, #2) until In Your House #7 where specific subtitles were added which usually referred to the main event, starting with In Your House #7: Good Friends, Better Enemies (refers to the Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel match).

Gradually the subtitles became "In Your House" (example: Unforgiven: In Your House). Current PPV's No Way Out, Backlash, Judgment Day and Unforgiven all came from the In Your House series.

Albania veneta

Albania Veneta (English: "Venetian Albania") was the name for the possessions of the Republic of Venice in southern Dalmatia from 1420 to 1797. 

It originally covered the coastal area of what is now northern Albania and the coast of Montenegro, but the Albanian and southern Montenegrin parts were lost to the Ottomans in 1571 . 

The word "Veneta" in "Albania Veneta" was used to differentiate the area from the Ottoman Albania (called "Albania Ottomana" in those centuries), an area stretching from Kosovo to southern Albania .

These Venetian possessions stretched from the southern borders of the "Republic of Ragusa" (modern-day Dubrovnik) to Durazzo (Durrës) in coastal Albania. The Venetian territories never reached more than 20 km from the Adriatic Sea. After 1573 the southern limit was moved to the village of Confin (Kufin) near Budua (Budva), because of the Ottoman conquests of Antivari (Bar), and Dulcigno (Ulcinj) in the Balkans.

The Dominions of Venice were centered around the "Bocche di Cattaro" (Bay of Kotor) and included the small cities of Cattaro (Kotor), Risano (Risan), Perasto (Perast), Teodo (Tivat), Castelnuovo (Herceg Novi), Budua (Budva) and Spizza (Sutomore).

Venice started to take control of the small southern Dalmatian villages around the 10th century, assimilating quickly the neolatin "Dalmatian language" of the coastal areas into the Venetian language. But only in the 14th century was the Republic of Venice able to create a territorial continuity around the Bay of Kotor. These Venetian dominions around Cattaro (Kotor) lasted from 1420 to 1797 and were called "Albania Veneta", a historical province of the Republic of Venice .

When the Turks started to conquer the Balkans in 15th century, many Christian Slavs took refuge inside Venetian Dalmatia and so even the "Albania Veneta" started to have a huge Serb and Albanian population. By the end of 17th century the Romance speaking population of the historical "Albania Veneta" was already a minority, according to Oscar Randi in his book ""Dalmazia etnica, incontri e fusioni" .

After the Napoleonic armies conquered and put an end to the Republic of Venice in 1797, the area of the Albania veneta changed control many times:
in 1805 was annexed to the Napoleonic "Kingdom of Italy" , then in 1809 was part of French "Illyrian Provinces" and finally in 1815 was put under Habsburg control in the Dalmatia of the Austrian Empire.

Under the Habsburg domination, "Albania Veneta" was part of "Austrian Dalmatia" and in 1878 (at the "Congress of Berlin") another 40 km² around Sutomore were added to this territory.

The borders of the former Venetian province of "Albania Veneta" changed again in 1918, when was created the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, but were reinstated from 1941 to 1943 during World War II, when Mussolini annexed the territories around Cattaro to the Kingdom of Italy. The area was part of the Italian "Governatorato di Dalmazia" and was called "Provincia di Cattaro" .

After World War II any political entity related to the historical presence of Venice in southern Dalmatia ceased to exist and the area was definitely incorporated into Yugoslavia.
The old "Albania Veneta" is currently a coastal region of the newly independent Montenegro.

According to the Dalmatian historian Luigi Paulucci (in his book "Le Bocche di Cattaro nel 1810") the population of the "Albania Veneta", during the centuries of the Republic of Venice, was mainly Venetian speaking (approximately 66%) in the urban areas (Cattaro, Perasto, Budua, ecc..) around the "Bocche di Cattaro" (Bay of Kotor). 

But in the inland areas more than half of the population was Serbo-Croatian speaking, after the first years of the eighteenth century. Paulucci wrote even that near the border with Albania there were big communities of Albanian speaking people: Dulcigno (Ulcinj) was half Albanian, one quarter Venetian and one quarter Slavic-speaking .

During the French rule of the area of Cattaro the schools were in Italian, when the former Albania Veneta was part of the Napoleonic "Kingdom of Italy" . 

The Slovenian Marko Trogrli in his essay "The French school system in French Dalmatia" wrote that "Vincenzo Dandolo, the French governor of Dalmatia as well as Bartolomeo Benincasa, an official from the local (Dalmatian) Education Department, published in May 1807 a plan for the province's public education ("Il piano generale della pubblica istruzione in Dalmazia"), which had to be consistent with the education system throughout the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy...Instruction was to be in Italian" .

During the nineteenth century, according to the historian Scaglioni Marzio, the wars of independence of Italy from the Austro-Hungarian empire created a situation of harassment against the Italian (or Venetian speaking) communities in the Austrian southern Dalmatia . 

The result was that in 1880 there were in Cattaro, according to the Austrian census, only 930 ethnic Italians (or only 32% of a total population of 2910 people). 

Furthermore, in the Austrian census of 1910, the Italians were reduced to only 13.6% in that city, according to Diego De Castro in his book "Dalmazia, popolazione e composizione etnica. Cenno storico sul rapporto etnico tra Italiani e Slavi nella Dalmazia" . 

There are currently 500 Italian speakers in Montenegro, mainly in the area of Cattaro (Kotor) and Perasto (Perast), who constitute the "Comunitá Nazionale Italiana del Montenegro".

The "disappearance" of the Italian speaking populations in Dalmatia was nearly complete after World War II. The linguist Matteo Bartoli calculated that the Italians were 33% of the Dalmatian population during the Napoleonic wars, while currently there are only 300 Italians in Croatian Dalmatia and 500 Italians in coastal Montenegro.

Heliantheae

Heliantheae is the most well known tribe of the sunflower family (Asteraceae). The name comes from the Greek word for "sun flower". The Heliantheae is the third largest tribe in the sunflower family, which has 190 genera and about 2500 species. Only the tribes Senecioneae and Astereae are larger. Most Heliantheae come from North America and South America, and Mexico. A few genera come from tropical areas.

Most Heliantheae are herbs or shrubs, but there are some that grow to the size of small trees. Leaves are usually hairy and arranged in opposite pairs. The anthers are usually black.

Heliantheae can be grown on farms. These include sunflowers and jerusalem artichokes. Many garden flowers are also in this group, such as "Coreopsis", "Cosmos", "Echinacea", "Rudbeckia", and "Zinnia".

There are also some weeds in the family. Species of "Ambrosia" (ragweed) produce lots of pollen. Each plant can produce about a billion grains of pollen over a season, and the plant is wind-pollinated. It is one of the main causes of hayfever. 

In 1981 Harold Ernest Robinson came up with a new way to describe the tribe. He divided Heliantheae into 35 subtribes:

Okrika Nweke

Okrika Nweke is a village located in Ekwerazu in Ahiazu-Mbaise Local Government of Imo State, Nigeria. Okrika Nweke was formerly part of Umuokrika before securing autonomy. The village derives its name from the Ekeokwe market and is made up of Umuevu and Akpim. The village can be accessed from Ogbe by turning off to the left at about 21 Kilometres along the Owerri/Umuahia road. There are also other minor access roads around into the Village. The population is mostly Roman Catholics and they have two prominent Churches buildings. There is inter-marriage between three sections of the community namely Lomoma, Mpe na Ezeala and Akpim. Various traditional ceremonies are celebrated such as 'Iri Ji', 'Mgba' and 'Ekpe'. Most of the indegenes reside outside the village but own residential houses there and visit frequently particularly during festive occassions like Christmas, Easter and August meeting. 
Another traditional ceremony performed by Lomoma [in Umuevu] is the Iwa Akwa Ceremony which is the traditional coming of age ceremony. The 'Iwa Akwa' ceremony is celebrated with pomp and peagantry and is restricted to young men who have been adjudged by the elders to have come of age and takes place every 4 or 5 years.
The first Eze (Traditional Ruler) of the Community was late Eze Aloy-Alex Nwokedikwa (Igwe ka-ala, Onugaotu I of Okrika-Nweke). He joined his ancestors in November 2006. The reign of Eze Nwokedikwa (Uju) was very peaceful. A philantropist of high repute, who was loved by his people. However things have taken a turn for the worst since the demise of the Eze Nwokedikwa (Uju). The seed of the crisis was sown by a cabal who went against the Constitution of the Community by installing the second son of the late Eze as a Regent; a position unknown to the constitution. It is worthy of note to mention here that the so-called Regent (Nma-Agha) is a high-schoold drop-out, a brigand of no known means of livelihood. The so-called Regent working in concert with the 'Umuezeala Cabal'(his main supporters) has refused and/or ignored to participate in the memorial service of the late Eze so that another Eze will emerge from Akpim Community as provided for in the Constitution of Okrika-Nweke Autonomous Community. As a result of the foregong, Okrika-Nweke which used to be the envy of other adjoining communities has known no unity, peace, development and progress since then.

Borderline personality disorder

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a type of personality disorder and mental illness.
People diagnosed with BPD might have strong mood swings, see things as "all good" or "all bad" (splitting), and be confused about their identity. They might have a lot of trouble with relationships with other people.

Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals diagnose people with BPD using a book called the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders" (DSM-IV-TR). They look at a person's behaviour and how they are feeling. If the person has five or more of the following signs, the DSM-IV-TR says that they have BPD.

People with BPD often have other mental health problems, like depression, eating disorders, anxiety and substance abuse.

There is no one cause for BPD. Some researchers think that it might be caused by trauma in childhood, like sexual abuse and neglect. A lot of people with BPD say that they were abused when they were children.
It can be very difficult to treat BPD, and it might take many years. Some types of psychotherapy can help, like dialectical behavioral therapy. Some doctors give patients with BPD medicines like antidepressants, antipsychotics or mood stabilizers.

People's moods also change when things happen to them. For example, if something bad happens in a person's life, they may be sad or angry as a result.

When people's moods are disturbed for a long time, they may have a mental illness called a mood disorder, like major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder.

Appetite

Appetite is wanting to eat food, the feeling of hunger. Humans and animals have appetite to make sure that they eat enough food to survive. A loss of appetite is also called anorexia (this is not the same as the eating disorder anorexia nervosa).

Appetite can change when people are ill, when they have eating disorders and when they are on different types of medications. A big appetite can make somebody eat more than they need to, and they can put on weight, even becoming obese. A small appetite can make someone eat less than they need to, making them lose weight or become malnourished.

Parliament of Australia

The Parliament of Australia is the federal governing system in Australia. It was formed on May 9, 1901. The parliament is bicameral, which means it has two houses, the House of Representatives and the Senate. It was copied mainly from the way the United Kingdom's Parliament was run, the Westminster system, but it also has some ideas from the United States Congress. The laws which control the way the parliament is set up and its powers are part of the Australian Constitution. The Parliament meets in a special building, Parliament House, in Canberra.

The parliament has four main functions:

The Australian Parliament first met in the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne in 1901. It then took over the Victorian Parliament in Melbourne until it moved to Canberra in 1927. A new building for the Parliament was finished in 1988 to celebrate 200 years of European settlement in Australia.

There are 150 members of the House of Representatives, each one elected for a three year term. Each member represents about 150,000 people living in an electorate. The boundaries of each electorate are often changed to keep the the number of people in each electorate is the same. The size of each electorate can be very different. The electorate of Kalgoorlie, in Western Australia, covers an area of 2.3 million square kilometres, while Wentworth in New South Wales is only 26 square kilometres.

The government is formed by the political party (or group of political parties) who have the most members in the House. The House is set out in the British style, even using the green colours of the House of Commons. The Speaker sits at the front; the members of the government sit on the seats to his right, and the opposition sits on the seats to his left. The Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, government ministers, and the shadow ministers, sit at a large table in the centre.

<doc id="197007" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197007" title="Las Meninas">
Las Meninas

Las Meninas is a very famous painting by the Spanish painter Diego Velázquez. The painting hangs in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, the capital of Spain. It was painted in 1656.

The word “Menina” means “lady-in-waiting” or “Maid of Honour” i.e. a girl who serves in a royal court. There is a lot of detail in the painting, and more has been written about it than about almost any other Western painting because it is quite complicated. For example: people do not always agree about who is looking at whom and why they are standing there.

"Las Meninas" shows a large room in the Madrid palace of King Philip IV of Spain. Several people are in the painting, and we know who they are. Some are looking at one another and others are looking out from the painting at the viewer (the person who is looking at the painting).

The person who stands in the middle is the Infanta Margarita (the princess, daughter of the king and queen). She has two maids of honour, one on each side of her, a chaperone, a bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Velázquez has also painted himself, standing just behind the princess and her companions. He is standing at the artist’s easel. He has stopped painting for a moment and looks straight out at the viewer. At the back of the room is a mirror in which we can see the top halves of the bodies of the king and queen. This means that the king and queen are the viewers who are looking at the painting. The king and queen are probably being painted by Velázquez, but not everybody agrees with this.

Velázquez was very famous in his lifetime. He painted portraits of several royal people at the Spanish court. Philip himself did not like being painted when he was old, but he allowed Velázquez to include him in "Las Meninas". He had given Velázquez a special room where he could paint, and he often sat and watched the painter at work in his studio.

The painting was damaged a bit by a fire in 1734 and some of it was repainted, including the left cheek of the Infanta. In recent years it lost some of its colour, partly due to the pollution caused by so many visitors to the gallery. It was cleaned in 1984. Some people thought it made the picture look different.
The people in "Las Meninas" are in Velázquez's studio in the royal palace. The Infanta Margarita (number 1 in the key picture) in the middle of the picture is five years old. She later married the Roman Emperor Leopold. She has two ladies-in-waiting ("meninas"): doña Isabel de Velasco (2), who is about to curtsy to the princess, and doña María Agustina Sarmiento de Sotomayor (3), who kneels in front of Margarita, offering her a drink from a red cup, or "bucaro", that she holds on a golden tray. To the right of the Infanta are two dwarfs: Maribarbola (4) who was German, and Nicolas Pertusato (5) who was Italian. He is trying to wake up a dog by his feet. Behind them stands doña Marcela de Ulloa (6), the princess's chaperone, dressed in mourning and talking to a bodyguard (or "guardadamas") (7). We do not know the name of the bodyguard.

At the back on the right stands Don José Nieto Velázquez (8)—the queen's chamberlain during the 1650s, and the head of the royal tapestry works—who may have been a relative of the artist. Nieto is shown pausing, with his right knee bent and his feet on different steps. We are not sure what he is doing. None of the people in the picture can see him. Only the viewer (the king and queen?) can.

Velázquez himself (9) stands to the left of the scene, looking outward past a large canvas supported by an easel. On his chest is the red cross of the Order of Santiago, which he did not receive until 1659, three years after the painting was completed. He later added the cross to the painting.

The mirror on the back wall reflects the upper bodies and heads of the King Philip IV (10) and his queen, Mariana (11). Most people think that they are being painted by Velázquez, and that their daughter, the Infanta, is watching them.

Bonao

Bonao is a Dominican city and the head municipality of the Monseñor Nouel province, in the center of the country. 

"Bonao" is the Taíno name of the region where the old city was founded. The city is in the Bonao Valley, at about 85 km to the northwest of Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic.

The municipality had, in 2002, a total population of 126,668: 63,286 men and 63,382 women. The urban population was 58.43% of the total population. In this numbers are included the population of the municipal districts that are part the municipality.

Bonao is located in the Bonao Valley, a small valley among mountains located in the centre of the Dominican Republic.

The city is near the River Yuna, one of the most important river of the Hispaniola island; the sources of the river are on the eastern side of the Cordillera Central mountain range. It flows through the Bonao Valley and then through the Cibao Valley and into the Samaná Bay.

There are other smaller rivers near Bonao, tributaries of the River Yuna.

The municipality of Bonao has five municipal districts; these are:

Christopher Columbus founded in 1494 a small fort in the region known by the Taíno people as Bonao. The fort was built to protect the gold mines around Maimón and other places. But there was not much gold in the region and the fort was soon left without people.

The town was founded again during the early years of the 19th century but at about 5 km to the north of the old place, closer to the River Yuna. The new town had the name "Yuna" was soon was changed to the old one: "Bonao". It was also called "El Bonao" (English: "The Bonao") but the article "El" (English: "The") was left out during the first years of the 20th century and it is never used now.

The new small town was made a "Puesto Cantonal" (and old category, like a "Military Post") in 1859 and then a municipality of La Vega province in 1865.

In 1936, its name was changed to "Monseñor Meriño" after the Archbishop Adolfo A. Nouel, past president of the country. In 1960, it got is old name of Bonao.

Farming is very important around the city; it is one of main regions of the country where rice is grown.

Mining is also important here; nickel is mined in a mountain close to the city by the Falconbridge, a Canadian company.

<doc id="197058" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197058" title="Moon landing conspiracy theory">
Moon landing conspiracy theory

The moon landing conspiracy theory (also known as Moon landing hoax or Apollo hoax) is the belief that men did not land on the Moon in 1969–1972 during the Apollo program and that NASA faked the evidence. Some conspiracy theorists believe the Skylab space station is also a hoax.

This belief is considered by the scientific community and historians to be irrational. But on the internet, the debate can occur since it is easy for anyone to publish their ideas. There are entire subcultures within the USA and substantial cultures around the world that believe that the Moon landings were faked. This view is taught in Cuban schools and wherever else Cuban teachers are sent (Nicaragua, Angola, etc.). It is also shared by the Taliban and by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.

On 12 April 1961, the USSR sent the first man into space—Yuri Gagarin. Six weeks later, US President John Kennedy promised a manned Moon landing by 1969 to win the battle of systems and impress the world with technical superiority:

Moon conspiracy theorists say that NASA had too many technical problems to meet the eight year deadline for going to the moon. But the USA could not afford to appear lose the race to the moon to the Soviet Union, and so the moon landings were faked. In 2004, President George Bush gave not eight but sixteen years for a manned return to the Moon, even though the technologies for it should have already been developed forty years earlier. In 2010, President Barack Obama canceled this plan, which seemed to the moon conspiracy theorists to be an admission that the USA still does not have the technology to go to the moon.

Doubts about the authenticity of the Apollo Moon landings appeared first in December 1968 when Apollo 8 was launched. The almost perfectly executed odyssey of Apollo 11 amazed many around the world, and some people doubted it was real.

The first book on the subject ("Did man land on the Moon?") was issued in Texas by the mathematician James J. Cranny in 1970.

NASA commented on some of the conspiracy theories in June 1977. But in August 1997, their Director of Media Services (1998–2000) Brian Welch (1958–2000) said in an interview with Sky TV News:

When Fox TV aired Bruce Nash's film "Conspiracy theory: Did we land on the Moon?" in 2001, NASA released hoax theory rebuttal materials on their web and FTP sites. They also wrote suggestions for science teachers on how to refute the hoax claims using the Lunar Sample Disk Kits.

In 2002, NASA hired James Edward Oberg, to write a book intended to challenge those who claim the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax. Oberg was a former rocket scientist, MSNBC News space consultant and analyst and journalist, and, it was later discovered, a moon landing conspiracy theorist. But NASA soon cancelled the project, declining to give the reasons for this. NASA spokesman Bob Jacobs said criticism that NASA was displaying poor judgement and a lack of confidence in commissioning the book caused the agency to abort it. For example, then NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe said:

In 2006, some of the recordings of the Apollo era were declared missing. The question of what happened to the recordings was seen by conspiracy theorists as confirmation of their beliefs, and in 2009, NASA revealed that the tapes were erased.

The claims and counterclaims surrounding the moon conspiracy theories are extremely detailed and complex. Some of the major points and counterpoints are listed below.

Moon conspiracy theorists think that NASA faked the Apollo mission with a secret program. According to James Longuski, the complexity of the conspiracy theory scenarios make them impossible. More than 400,000 people worked on the Apollo project for almost ten years, and 12 men who walked on the Moon returned to Earth to talk about their experiences. Hundreds of thousands of people would have had to keep the secret. Longuski says that it would have been a lot easier to actually land on the Moon than to create such a large conspiracy to fake it.

Moon conspiracy theorists say that telescopes like the Hubble should be able to take pictures of the moon where Apollo landed, and if people really did land on the moon then the pictures should show the scars on the moon's surface and equipment it left behind. They believe that our major observatories will not take pictures of the landing sites because it would expose the cover-up. 

NASA has said that images have been taken of these landing sites, but the pictures taken by Hubble are too low quality to see very much detail. In 2009 NASA released pictures from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter showing the Apollo landing sites in more detail. These photographs have not convinced the moon landing conspiracy theorists because the pictures were taken by NASA, and they think NASA is behind the cover-up.

Blueprints and drawings of the machines used in the Apollo project are missing. Some Apollo 11 tapes containing telemetry and high quality video of the first moonwalk are also missing. Moon landing conspiracy theorists believe that this is because they never existed, since the mission was faked.

Dr. David Williams (NASA archivist at Goddard Space Flight Center) and Apollo 11 flight director Eugene F. Kranz acknowledged that some of the Apollo 11 tapes are missing. When the recordings were sent back to Earth to be shown on TV, they were converted to a different format which was lower quality. Now the lower quality tapes are available, but the original high quality videos received in Australia are missing. Some pictures of the original high quality image are still available, and videos have been released from other missions too, like the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package.

Some people at NASA are looking for the tapes to help them plan for future missions. They believe the Apollo 11 tapes were sent for storage at the U.S. National Archives in 1970, but by 1984 all the Apollo 11 tapes had been returned to the Goddard Space Flight Center. The tapes may have been stored rather than re-used, and efforts to determine where they were stored are ongoing. Goddard was storing 35,000 new tapes per year in 1967, even before the lunar landings.

On November 1, 2006 Cosmos Magazine reported that 100 data tapes recorded in Australia during the Apollo 11 mission had been found in the basement of the Curtain University of Technology in Perth, Australia. One of the old tapes was sent to NASA for analysis. 

On July 16, 2009, NASA said that it must have erased the original Apollo 11 Moon footage years ago so that it could reuse the tape. On December 22, 2009 NASA issued a final report on the tapes. Senior engineer Dick Nafzger concluded that approximately 45 tapes of Apollo 11 video were erased and reused. For the 40th anniversary of the Apollo moon landing, Lowry Digital of Burbank, California restored the low quality videos. Some pieces of the restored footage are available on the NASA website.

Bart Sibrel (a moon landing conspiracy theorist) says that the Soviet Union had much more time in space than the United States before the Apollo Program. The Soviet Union put the first satellite in orbit in October 1957 named Sputnik 1. They also put the first animal in space in Sputnik 2, and were the first country to safely bring back an animal from space in Sputnik 5. Yuri Gagrin was the first man to orbit the Earth in Vostok 1, who was also from the Soviet Union. Sibrel believes that since the Soviet Union was so far ahead of the United States in the Moon race, the United States had to fake the landings to win.

On January 27, 1967, Apollo 1 caught fire and killed 3 astronauts. Two years later, NASA said that the problems which caused the fire were fixed. Bart Sibrel believes that the problems could not be fixed, so NASA decided to fake the landings to win the Moon race. 

NASA says that the Soviet Union's achievements were not as impressive as the United States. Before Apollo 7, the USSR made 9 spaceflights, while the U.S. had made 16. Between 1961 and 1967, the U.S. had 7 more spaceflights than the USSR, and 600 more hours in space. Apollo 7 launched in October 1968, 21 months after the Apollo 1 fire, with an astronaut on board. By Apollo 11, the Uninted States' lead was even bigger.

Both the United States and the USSR had many problems during the Moon race. The USSR had the first in-flight death in 1967, only 3 months after the Apollo 1 fire. According to NASA, most of the accomplishments first made by the USSR were also made by the US within a year. By 1965, the US started to beat the USSR to a few important steps. The USSR never developed a rocket which could land on the Moon, and they never tested landing on the Moon with an astronaut on board. "

Some conspiracy theorists say that the Moon rocks collected by the Apollo Program are actually meteorites from Antarctica. Wernher von Braun, the Marshall Space Flight Center Director, and three others traveled to Antarctica in 1967 (three years before the Apollo launch) to explore for future space missions. Some conspiracy theorists believe that Braun collected meteorites during this trip to use as fake moon rocks. 

The Apollo Program collected of moon rocks during the Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 missions. According to scientists around the world, these rocks are very different from meteorites and other rocks found on Earth. The rocks are also 200,000,000 years older than any rock found on Earth, and are similar to moon rocks later brought back by the USSR.

Some moon rocks could have been collected without landing on the moon, but the first moon rock was found on Earth in 1979, and it was only discovered in 1982 that it came from the moon. Also, moon rocks are very rare on Earth, and only 30 kilograms have ever been discovered, while the Apollo missions brought back 382 kilograms.

In 2004, Martin Hendry and Ken Skeldon from the University of Glasgow investigated the 'Moon Hoax'. In November 2004, they spoke at the Glasgow Science Centre and examined the top ten lines of evidence that a hoax had taken place. 

In a television program about the hoax, Fox Entertainment Group listed 10 astronauts and 2 others who had possibly been killed as part of a cover-up.


All the deaths except for Irwin's were related to their job with NASA or the Air Force. Mike Adams and Robert Lawrence were not involved with the civilian space program. James Irwin already had several heart attacks before his death. All except two of the deaths happened at least one or two years "before" Apollo 11. Also, Brian Welch was speaking out "against" the moon hoax, so he would not have been a good target to be killed.

In April 2010 nine of the twelve astronauts who landed on the Moon are still alive, including Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.

Whig Party (United States)

The Whig Party was a political party of the United States. It was famous during the years of Jacksonian democracy. It is thought to be important to the Second Party System. Operating from 1833 to 1856, the party was formed opposing the policies of President Andrew Jackson and the Democratic Party. The Whigs supported the importance of Congress over the importance executive branch. They favored a program of modernization. Their name was chosen to tell people about the American Whigs of 1776, who fought for independence. "Whig" was then a widely recognized label of choice for people who saw themselves as opposing autocratic rule. The Whig Party had national leaders as Daniel Webster, William Henry Harrison, Henry Clay of Kentucky. The Whig Party also had four war heroes among them, such as Generals Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott. Abraham Lincoln was a Whig leader in frontier Illinois.

In its over two decades of existence, the Whig Party saw two of its candidates, Harrison and Taylor, elected president. Both, died in office. John Tyler became president after Harrison's death, but was thrown out from the party. Millard Fillmore, who became president after Taylor's death, was the last Whig to hold the nation's highest office.

The party was ultimately destroyed by the question of whether to allow the expansion of slavery to the territories. The anti-slavery faction successfully prevented the nomination of its own incumbent President Fillmore in the 1852 presidential election. Instead, the party nominated General Winfield Scott, who was defeated. Its leaders quit politics (as Lincoln did temporarily) or changed parties. The voter base defected to the Republican Party, various coalition parties in some states, and to the Democratic Party. By the 1856 presidential election, the party had lost its ability to maintain a national coalition of effective state parties and endorsed Millard Fillmore, now of the American Party, at its last national convention.

Samlesbury witches

The Samlesbury witches were three women who were said to be witches, murderers and cannibals. They were tried in the village of Samlesbury in Lancashire. Their trial on 19 August 1612 was one of a series of witch trials held over two days. It is among the most famous in English history. The trials were unusual for England at that time for two reasons. First, Thomas Potts, the clerk to the court, wrote about it in his "The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster". Secondly, the number of people found guilty and hanged was high, ten at Lancaster and another at York. However, the three Samlesbury women were found not guilty of witchcraft.some of the accused were burned alive and hung.

The three women were Jane Southworth, Jennet Bierley, and Ellen Bierley. A 14 year old girl, Grace Sowerbutts, had said they used witchcraft. The women were accused of murdering children, and of cannibalism, amongst other things. In contrast, other people tried at the same time were accused of "maleficium", that is causing harm by witchcraft. This included the Pendle witches. The case against the three women collapsed "spectacularly" when the main witness, Grace Sowerbutts, was shown by the trial judge to be "the perjuring tool of a Catholic priest".

Many historians, notably Hugh Trevor-Roper, have said that the witch trials of the 16th and 17th century were a result of the religious struggles of the period. During this time, both the Catholic and Protestant Churches wanted to stamp out what they saw as heresy. The trial of the Samlesbury witches is perhaps one clear example of that trend; it has been described as "largely a piece of anti-Catholic propaganda". A trial would show that Lancashire, a wild and lawless area, was being cleared not only of witches but also of "popish plotters", that is, Catholics.

King James I, came to the English throne in 1603. James was influenced by the strict Scottish Reformation very much. He was very interested in in witchcraft. By the early 1590s, he was convinced that Scottish witches plotted against him. His 1597 book, "Daemonologie", he told his followers that they must report and prosecute any supporters or practitioners of witchcraft. In 1604 a new witchcraft law was made, called "An Act against Conjuration, Witchcraft and dealing with evil and wicked spirits". Anyone who caused harm by the use of magic or the exhumation of corpses for magical purposes would be given the death penalty. James was, did not believe some of the evidence presented in witch trials, he even personally showed discrepancies in the testimonies presented against some accused witches.

The accused witches lived in Lancashire. At the end of the 16th century, the government thought this county was a wild and lawless area, "fabled for its theft, violence and sexual laxity, where the church was honoured without much understanding of its doctrines by the common people". Since the death of Queen Mary and the coming to the throne of her half-sister Elizabeth in 1558, Catholic priests had been forced to hide, but in remote areas like Lancashire they were still able to celebrate mass in secret. In early 1612, the year of the trials, each justice of the peace (JP) in Lancashire was ordered to make a list of the recusants in their area—those who refused to attend the services of the Church of England, which was a criminal offence at that time.

During the 16th century English Reformation, the Church of England broke away from the rule of the pope and the Catholic Church. This event split up the Southworth family of Samlesbury Hall. Sir John Southworth, head of the family until his death in 1595, was a leading recusant. He had been arrested many times for not giving up his Catholic faith. His eldest son, also called John, did join the Church of England, for which his father disinherited him. The rest of the family stayed strictly Catholic.

One of the accused witches, Jane Southworth, was the widow of the disinherited son, John. Relations father and son were not polite; John Singleton, said that the father would not even go passed his son's house if he could keep clear of it, and believed that Jane would probably kill her husband. Jane Southworth (born Jane Sherburne) and John were married in about 1598, and the couple lived in Samlesbury Lower Hall. John had died only a few months before her trial for witchcraft in 1612, and she had seven children.

On 21 March 1612, Alizon Device, who lived just outside the Lancashire village of Fence, near Pendle Hill, met John Law, a pedlar from Halifax. She asked him for some pins, which he refused to give to her, and a few minutes later Law suffered a stroke, for which he blamed Alizon. Along with her mother Elizabeth and her brother James, Alizon had to appear before local magistrate Roger Nowell on 30 March 1612. Based on the evidence and confessions he obtained, Nowell sent Alizon and ten others to Lancaster Gaol, to be tried for "maleficium"—causing harm by witchcraft.

Other Lancashire magistrates learned of Nowell's discovery of witchcraft in the county. On 15 April 1612 JP Robert Holden began investigations in his own area of Samlesbury. As a result, eight individuals were sent to trial, including Jane Southworth, Jennet Bierley, and Ellen Bierley. They were said to have used witchcraft on Grace Sowerbutts, Jennet's grand-daughter and Ellen's niece.

The trial was held on 19 August 1612 before Sir Edward Bromley, a judge seeking promotion to a circuit nearer London. He may have wanted to impress King James, the head of the judiciary. Before the trial, Bromley ordered the release of five of the eight defendants from Samlesbury, with a warning about their future conduct. Jane Southworth, Jennet Bierley, and Ellen Bierley were said to have used "diverse devillish and wicked Arts, called Witchcrafts, Inchauntments, Charmes, and Sorceries, in and upon one Grace Sowerbutts", to which they pleaded not guilty. Fourteen-year-old Grace was the chief prosecution witness.

Grace was the first to give evidence. She said that both her grandmother and aunt, Jennet and Ellen Bierley, were able to change themselves into dogs and that they had "haunted and vexed her" for years. She also said that they had transported her to the top of a hayrick by her hair. They had also tried to make her drown herself. Grace said the women had taken her to the house of Thomas Walshman and his wife, from whom they had stolen a baby to suck its blood. Grace said the child died the next night and after its burial at Samlesbury Church, Ellen and Jennet dug up the body and took it home. The women then cooked and ate some of it and used the rest to make an ointment that let them change themselves into other shapes.

Grace also said that her grandmother and aunt, with Jane Southworth, went to sabbats held every Thursday and Sunday night at Red Bank, on the north shore of the River Ribble. At those secret meetings they met with "foure black things, going upright, and yet not like men in the face", with whom they ate, danced, and had sex.

Thomas Walshman, the father of the baby allegedly killed and eaten by the accused, was the next to give evidence. He confirmed that his child had died of unknown causes at about one-year-old. He added that Grace Sowerbutts was discovered lying as if dead in his father's barn on about 15 April, and did not recover until the following day. Two other witnesses, John Singleton and William Alker, confirmed that Sir John Southworth, Jane Southworth's father-in-law, had been reluctant to pass the house where his son lived, as he believed Jane to be an "evil woman, and a Witch".

Thomas Potts, the clerk, wrote that after hearing the evidence many of those in court were persuaded of the accused's guilt. On being asked by the judge what answer they could make to the charges laid against them, Potts reports that they "humbly fell upon their knees with weeping teares", and "desired him [Bromley] for Gods cause to examine Grace Sowerbutts". Immediately "the countenance of this Grace Sowerbutts changed"; the witnesses "began to quarrel and accuse one another", and eventually admitted that Grace had been coached in her story by a Catholic priest they called Thompson. Bromley then committed the girl to be examined by two JPs, William Leigh and Edward Chisnal. Under questioning Grace readily admitted that her story was untrue, and said she had been told what to say by Jane Southworth's uncle, Christopher Southworth aka Thompson, a Jesuit priest who was in hiding in the Samlesbury area; Southworth was the chaplain at Samlesbury Hall, and Jane Southworth's uncle by marriage. Leigh and Chisnal questioned the three accused women in an attempt to discover why Southworth might have fabricated evidence against them, but none could offer any reason other than that each of them "goeth to the [Anglican] Church".

After the statements had been read out in court Bromley ordered the jury to find the defendants not guilty, stating that:

Potts finished his book with the words: "Thus were these poore Innocent creatures, by the great care and paines of this honourable Judge, delivered from the danger of this Conspiracie; this bloudie practise of the Priest laid open".

Almost everything that is known about the trials comes from a report of the proceedings written by Thomas Potts, the clerk to the Lancaster Assizes. Potts was told to write his account by the trial judges, and had completed the work by 16 November 1612. Bromley revised and corrected the manuscript before its publication in 1613, and said it was "truly reported" and "fit and worthie to be published". Although written as an apparently verbatim account, the book is not a report of what was actually said at the trial, but instead a reflection on what happened. Nevertheless, Potts "seems to give a generally trustworthy, although not comprehensive, account of an Assize witchcraft trial, provided that the reader is constantly aware of his use of written material instead of verbatim reports".

In his introduction to the trial, Potts writes; "Thus have we for a time left the Graund Witches of the Forrest of Pendle, to the good consideration of a very sufficient jury." Bromley had by then heard the cases against the three Pendle witches who had confessed to their guilt, but he had yet to deal with the others, who maintained their innocence. He knew that the only testimony against them would come from a nine-year-old girl, and that King James had cautioned judges to examine carefully the evidence presented against accused witches, warning against credulity. In his conclusion to the account of the trial, Potts says that it was interposed in the expected sequence "by special order and commandment", presumably of the trial judges. After having convicted and sentenced to death three witches, Bromley may have been keen to avoid any suspicion of credulity by presenting his "masterful exposure" of the evidence presented by Grace Sowerbutts, before turning his attention back to the remainder of the Pendle witches.

Potts declares that "this Countie of Lancashire ... now may lawfully bee said to abound asmuch in Witches of divers kinds as Seminaries, Jesuites, and Papists", and describes the three accused women as having once been "obstinate Papists, and now came to Church". The judges would certainly have been keen to be regarded by King James, the head of the judiciary, as having dealt resolutely with Catholic recusants as well as with witchcraft, the "two big threats to Jacobean order in Lancashire". Samlesbury Hall, the family home of the Southworths, was suspected by the authorities of being a refuge for Catholic priests, and it was under secret government surveillance for some considerable time before the trial of 1612. It may be that JP Robert Holden was at least partially motivated in his investigations by a desire to "smoke out its Jesuit chaplain", Christopher Southworth.

The English experience of witchcraft was somewhat different from the European one, with only one really mass witchhunt, that of Matthew Hopkins in East Anglia during 1645. That one incident accounted for more than 20% of the number of witches it is estimated were executed in England between the early 15th and mid-18th century, fewer than 500. The English legal system also differed significantly from the inquisitorial model used in Europe, requiring members of the public to accuse their neighbours of some crime, and for the case to be decided by a jury of their peers. English witch trials of the period "revolved around popular beliefs, according to which the crime of witchcraft was one of ... evil-doing", for which tangible evidence had to be provided.
Potts devotes several pages to a fairly detailed criticism of the evidence presented in Grace Sowerbutts' statement, giving an insight into the discrepancies which existed during the early 17th century between the Protestant establishment's view of witchcraft and the beliefs of the common people, who may have been influenced by the more continental views of Catholic priests such as Christopher Southworth. Unlike their European counterparts, the English Protestant elite believed that witches kept familiars, or companion animals, and so it was not considered credible that the Samlesbury witches had none. Grace's story of the sabbat, too, was unfamiliar to the English at that time, although belief in such secret gatherings of witches was widespread in Europe. Most demonologists of the period, including King James, held that only God could perform miracles, and that he had not given the power to go against the laws of nature to those in league with the Devil. Hence Potts dismisses Sowerbutts' claim that Jennet Bierley transformed herself into a black dog with the comment "I would know by what means any Priest can maintaine this point of Evidence". He equally lightly dismisses Grace's account of the sabbat she claimed to have attended, where she met with "foure black things ... not like men in the face", with the comment that "The Seminarie [priest] mistakes the face for the feete: For Chattox [one of the Pendle witches] and all her fellow witches agree, the Devill is cloven-footed: but Fancie [Chattox's familiar] had a very good face, and was a proper man."

It is perhaps unlikely that the accused women would have failed to draw the examining magistrate's attention to their suspicions concerning Grace Sowerbutts' motivations when first examined, only to do so at the very end of their trial when asked by the judge if they had anything to say in their defence. The trial of the Samlesbury witches in 1612 may have been "largely a piece of anti-Catholic propaganda", or even a "show-trial", the purpose of which was to demonstrate that Lancashire was being purged not only of witches, but also of "popish plotters".

Bromley achieved his desired promotion to the Midlands Circuit in 1616. Potts was given the keepership of Skalme Park by King James in 1615, to breed and train the king's hounds. In 1618, he was given responsibility for "collecting the forfeitures on the laws concerning sewers, for twenty-one years". Jane Southworth's eldest son, Thomas, eventually inherited his grandfather's estate of Samlesbury Hall.

Guernica (painting)

Guernica is a world-famous painting by Pablo Picasso. It is one of the world's greatest anti-war paintings. It is a very large painting (a mural) which shows the bombing of the Spanish town of Guernica in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War.

The Spanish Republican government asked Pablo Picasso to paint a large mural for an art exhibition in Paris. It shows how people, as well as animals, all suffer because of the tragedies of war. The painting soon became so famous that it was seen as a world symbol for peace. The fame of the painting helped to bring the Spanish Civil War to an end.

"Guernica" is navy blue, black and white, 3.5 metre (11 ft) tall and 7.8 metre (25.6 ft) wide, a mural-size canvas painted in oil. It hangs in the Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid. 

"Guernica" shows a large, open room with people and animals who are suffering. A bull stands over a woman crying over a dead child in her arms. A horse falls in terrible pain as it dies after being run through with a spear. A dead soldier lies under the horse, his arm has been chopped off, but the hand grasps a shattered sword from which a flower grows. A light bulb shines strongly like an evil eye (the Spanish word for "lightbulb" is "bombilla" which sounds like "bomb"). A female figure floats in, holding a lamp which is a symbol of hope. There are many other smaller details in the painting.

The painting soon travelled to many countries. It was seen in several towns in the United States during the 1940s and early 1950s. The Spanish dictator Francisco Franco wanted it to come to Spain, but Picasso said that he would not allow it to go to Spain until Spain became a democratic country. Picasso died in 1973. Franco died in 1975 and Spain became a democratic country. The painting went to Spain in 1981 and it now hangs in an art gallery, the Museo Reina Sofía, in Madrid.

“’Pitcher plant”’s are carnivorous plants. Carnivores are animals that eat other animals. Carnivorous plants are plants that eat insects and other small animals. Carnivorous plants grow in soil that has little nitrogen. All living things must have nitrogen. Carnivorous plants get nitrogen from the insects they eat.

Pitcher plants catch (get) insects in a cup of liquid. The walls of the cup make nectar (sweet liquid) . The nectar attracts insects. When an insect lands on the wall, it slips (falls) down into the liquid. The insect cannot get out of the cup because the walls are smooth and slippery and the walls have hairs pointing down. After the insect is dead. Its body rots. Rotting releases (lets loose) the nitrogen from body. The nitrogen goes into the liquid. Then the plant takes nitrogen from the liquid.

Fried Green Tomatoes (movie)

Fried Green Tomatoes is a 1991 drama film directed by Jon Avnet. It is based on a novel by Fannie Flagg called "Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe". The film stars Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, Mary-Louise Parker and Mary Stuart Masterson.

A woman called Evelyn goes to a nursing home to visit her mother-in-law and meets an elderly lady called Ninny. They become friends. Ninny tells Evelyn stories about when she was younger, and about the people she used to know. In particular, she tells Evelyn about two young women, Idgie and Ruth.

In Ninny's stories, Idgie and Ruth are friends who run a café together and raise Ruth's son Buddy. Ruth has separated from her husband Frank because he used to hit her. One day, Frank goes missing and the police begin to think that Idgie has killed him.

Ninny tells Evelyn her stories over several visits. During that time, Evelyn, who was depressed, is inspired by Ruth and Idgie to have more power in her life. In the end, Ninny goes to live with Evelyn and her husband. There is a hint that Ninny and Idgie might be the same person.


There are some differences between the film and the novel it was made from. In the novel, Idgie and Ruth are a lesbian couple. In the film they seem to be just friends. The director, John Avnet said that he wanted viewers to make up their own minds. In one part of the film, Idgie and Ruth have a food fight. Avnet said that the food fight is symbolic of love-making. When it was released, some critics and LGBT activists were angry that the lesbian part of the story had been "glossed over". Even though the lesbian content had been hidden, the film won an award from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) for best feature film with lesbian content.

Another difference is that at the end of the film, it seems possible that Ninny is really Idgie. In the novel, they are completely separate characters and are sisters-in-law.

The film was nominated for two Academy Awards and two BAFTA awards.

Race condition

A Race condition (also called race hazard) is a problem with the design of a system. With a race condition, the result of a calculation or the behaviour of the system as a whole is dependent on how long a certain calculation takes, or when it is started. Race conditions occur is logic circuits and computer software, especially with multi-threaded or distributed systems.

It is often difficult to explain what a race condition is, but the metaphor of a horse race can be used as an explanation.

A computer program is like a horse race. It does different things at the same time, in a horse race, there are several horses that are running the race. Each horse represents what is usually called a "thread of execution". That way, one such thread may handle network communication, another one may be responsible for redrawing the user interface. In the case of a race condition, the application requires that a given horse "wins the race". The application may work if horse number five wins, but it will crash if any other horse wins the race. One solution to the problem is to use synchronization. This is like several jockeys teaming up, to make sure horse number five is ahead. 

On different computers, or in different situations, the application will vary in speed. Sometimes, it will be faster, other times slower. This may mean that on some systems, the race condition will never show, even though it may be easy to show it on others. Race conditions can be difficult to find. Bugs caused by race conditions are a frequent source of frustration within the profession of software development.

Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation

The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) is an American group that works to make sure that LGBT are not made to look bad in the media, and works so that the public are more accepting of LGBT people. It was founded in 1985 in New York City after there were a lot of negative reports about LGBT people, after the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. Their policies are for the freedom to be homosexual and not be judged.

The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation was started in 1985 in New York City. After the start of the AIDS , several newspapers, like the "New York Post" wrote reports that some people thought were homophobic and unfair. The Alliance was founded to protest against such negative coverage in the media.

Because of this, a group of people decided to band together and begin a group to change things. They were Vito Russo, Gregory Kolovakos, Darryl Rist, Allen Barnett and Jewelle Gomez. They named their group the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. At first they were more concerned with changing the way that stories about AIDS were reported to the public. As the group grew, they began to work with people in the entertainment industry to change the way that gay and lesbian people were made to look on films and on television.

Every year, GLAAD host a ceremony where GLAAD Media Awards are given to people in the media and in entertainment that have represented LGBT people and issues fairly. Since 2006, there have been four ceremonies every year, one each in New York City, San Francisco, Miami and Los Angeles.

<doc id="197296" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197296" title="Don Carlos">
Don Carlos

Don Carlos is an opera composed by Giuseppe Verdi. It was composed to a libretto in the French language by Camille du Locle and Joseph Méry. It was based on a famous German play called "Don Carlos, Infante of Spain" by Friedrich Schiller. Schiller’s story is based on the true story of the life of Carlos, Prince of Asturias (1545-1568) who was promised that he could marry Elisabeth of Valois, but then his father,Philip II of Spain, changed his mind and married her himself. It was part of the peace treaty ending the Italian War of 1551-1559 between the Houses of Habsburg and Valois. 

The opera was first performed at the Théâtre Impérial de l’Opéra in Paris on 11 March 1867. It has five acts. 

Don Carlos was written for performance in Paris. This has made a problem for the reputation of the opera, because it was tradition in France to write very long operas. They always included a lot of ballet music as well as the singing. Verdi’s opera was in five acts, and when it was performed in other countries it was too long for people’s tastes, so many cuts were made, including, at first, the whole of Act I. This is a great pity, because a lot of the music in Act One is very important, with tunes which also come later in the opera. Since the beginning of the 20th century most of the music of Act I is usually performed. There have been many different versions performed, with different parts of the opera cut. When the opera is sung in Italian it is called Don Carlo.

The story takes place at a time when Spain is just coming to the end of a war with France. It has been agreed between the two countries that Don Carlos, heir to the Spanish throne, will marry Elisabeth, the daughter of the King of France.

Don Carlos wants to see the girl he is to marry. He goes to France and, secretly, joins a royal hunt in which Elisabeth is taking part. Elisabeth and her page are separated from the others. Carlos speaks to her and offers to take her home. The princess asks him about the prince she is to marry. Carlos says that she need not worry because the prince is kind and in love with her. He then shows Elisabeth a photo of the prince, and then Elisabeth of course realizes that it is the prince she is talking to. They sing a love duet.

Some Spanish officials then come and tell Elisabeth that it has been decided that she is not to marry the prince: she is to marry his father, the king of Spain. The two lovers are dismayed at this news. The crowd of people beg Elisabeth to agree to marrying the King of Spain, so that the war will stop. In the end she agrees.

Don Carlos has gone to a monastery so that he can be quiet in his misery. His grandfather, Charles V, had spent his last days in this monastery. A monk talks to him. Carlos thinks the monk looks like his grandfather.

Carlos is filled with joy when his friend Rodrigue comes. He has just come back from Flanders, where there is still a lot of fighting. Carlos tells him a secret: that he is in love with Elisabeth who has now married his father and is therefore Queen of Spain. Rodrigue tells him he should spend his time helping the poor people of Flanders. The King and Queen process past the tomb.

When the Queen leaves the church she goes to the garden where her ladies are waiting for her. A messenger gives her a letter from her mother in Paris, but at the same time he secretly gives her a letter from Carlos. Rodrigue quietly talks to Eboli, the queen’s lady-in-waiting, while the queen reads the letters. Rodrigue asks the Queen to try to persuade the king to let Carlos talk to him. Eboli is in love with Carlos. She has noticed how Carlos has been agitated when he has been in the presence of the Queen, and thinks it is because Carlos loves her (Eboli).

Carlos is given a chance to meet Elisabeth privately. He calmly asks her whether she could persuade the King to send him to Flanders. However, he is not really calm, and soon he starts to be angry with her for not showing any love feelings towards him. She tells him that it is her duty now that she is Queen. Carlos understands, but is still in love with her. He falls at her feet. He grabs her and declares his love for her, but the Queen tears herself from him and he rushes off in despair.

The Kings comes out of church. He is very cross that his wife has been left on her own. He tells the lady-in-waiting to go away. The Queen comforts her. Then she and her ladies go.

Rodrigue asks the King to stop fighting the people of Flanders who are still dying and starving from hunger. The King says they were not faithful and deserve to be punished. He tells Rodrigue that he is afraid of what is going on between Elisabeth and Carlos. He tells him to be aware of the Inquisition.

A masked ball is taking place at the palace in Madrid. Carlos is waiting in the Queen’s garden. A lady comes to the garden, wearing a mask, like everyone else. He thinks it is the Queen and tells her how he loves her. When the lady takes her mask off he realizes it is Eboni. She accuses him of loving the Queen. At that moment Rodrigue comes. He says to Eboni that Carlos is not well and does not understand what he is talking about. But Eboni is not deceived and plans to ruin their love affair.

The second scene of the act takes place in a square in Madrid. An auto-da-fé is being prepared. During the time of the Spanish Inquisition this was a ceremony in which anyone who did not agree with the Roman Catholic church was burnt to death. Monks enter, followed by the unfortunate people who are going to be burnt. The people sing about the glories of Spain. King Philippe appears and repeats how he will fight against anyone who is an enemy of the Roman Catholic church. Six people, including Carlos, appear and fling themselves at his feet, begging him to stop his troops from killing the Flemish people. The King will not hear of it. Some of the crowd support the king, but others are begging him to have mercy. Carlos then asks his father to allow him to rule Flanders for him. The King does not allow this, because he realizes that this could be an opportunity for Carlos and the Flemish people to rise against him. Carlos is desperate. He draws his sword and says that he will save Flanders. The crowd are terrified to see him behave like this in front of the King. The King commands his soldiers to take the sword away from Carlos, but no one obeys him. In the end, Rodrigue (who realizes that this is going to be bad for him) saves the situation by calmly asking Carlos for the sword. He hands it over and Rodrigue gives it to the King. The monks process farther, and a voice from heaven promises peace in the world to come.

The King is alone in church. In a wonderful aria he sings of his sadness that his wife does not seem to love him. The Grand Inquisitor comes in. He is very old, and blind. The King tells him about his son, and asks the Inquisitor whether Carlos should be forgiven or sentenced to death. The Inquisitor answers that it is Rodrigue who should be killed. The king dares to disagree. The Inquisitor tells the King that he is not giving his heart to God. The Inquisitor goes.

The Queen rushes in and asks the King to help her look for a casket of jewels which have disappeared from her room. The King shows her that it is on the table. He tells her she must open it. She does so. At the top is a portrait of Carlos. The King is very angry and accuses her of adultery. She faints. The King calles Eboli and Rodrigue for help. The King feels sorry for his suspicion, but Eboli feels even more sorry because it was she who had taken the casket because she was jealous of Carlos and Elisabeth. It was she who had suggested the King should look in the jewel case. Rodrigue feels he can only save his friend by offering himself to be killed instead of Carlos. The King and Rodrigue leave. Eboni throws herself at the feet of the Queen, who has now revived, and confesses that she herself is guilty of adultery because she had slept with the king. Elisabeth remains calm, but tells Eboni to go away from her for ever and to live in a nunnery. When Eboni is left alone she expresses her feelings of terribly misery. Before she goes to the nunnery she has one more thing to do: to try to save Carlos from being put to death.

The second scene of the act shows Carlos in prison. Rodrigue comes to him. He knows that Flemish letters addressed to Carlos have been found in his possession. Someone comes in and kills Rodrigue. As he dies, he tells Carlos that the Queen will wait for him the next day outside the nunnery and will see him for the last time. He dies.

Sometimes Act IV ends here, but some performances continue to show a scene in which the King tries to give the sword back to his son, but Carlos accuses him of having murdered his friend. A group of people, including Eboli, enter the prison and cry to the King to set Carlos free. The Inquisitor appears. He tells the crowd angrily that they are wicked to go against God’s will. He tells them all to go down on their knees and repent.

Elisabeth kneels before the tomb of Charles V. She sings of her lost youth in France (some of the music from Act I comes back here). She prays for peace. Elisabeth and Carlos then meet for the last time (their third duet in the opera) and wish for happier times. The King and the Inquisitor have been hiding. They now appear and grab Carlos. The guards are told to grab him, but Carlos defends himself. Suddenly the voice of Charles V (or a monk in disguise) is heard. He takes his grandson into the safety of the cloister.

Don Carlos is a great opera. It has some of Verdi’s greatest music, especially the music of Act IV scene i, in which the events of the previous acts are all brought together. There are some wonderful duets (three duets for Carlos and Elisabeth) and some great bass arias. However, the opera is very long, but it is difficult to cut any of the singing without spoiling the drama.

Some people feel that the end of the opera is weak. In Schiller’s play there is a different ending. Carlos is handed over to the Inquisition and put to death.

Spanish Inquisition

The Spanish Inquisition was a tribunal started in 1478 in Spain. It was started by Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. During the Spanish Inquisition many people were burnt in front of crowds in the streets. Anyone who was not loyal to the Roman Catholic church was in danger of being called a heretic and being put to death by being burnt at the stake. Not only Protestants were put to death, but it was also an excuse to get rid of many Jews. A ceremony at which heretics were burnt was called an auto-da-fé. The judge was called the Inquisitor. 

The rulers of Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella, called for the Inquisition not to exterminate all non-believers of the Roman Catholic Church, but to discourage strong outward belief of other religions. Most trials ended with the defendant simply giving up his beliefs and being let go.

The Inquisition was not completely abolished until 1834.

George B. McClellan

George Brinton McClellan (December 3, 1826 – October 29, 1885) was a general in the American Civil War. In 1861 and 1862, he was in charge of the Army of the Potomac. He led the Peninsular Campaign, an attempt to take Richmond, Virginia that didn't work. Though he won the Battle of Antietam, he did not get along with President Abraham Lincoln, who fired him. After he stopped being a general, he became a politician, and ran against Lincoln in the 1864 election. He was later Governor of New Jersey, though he was originally from Pennsylvania. He was also a prominent engineer, and was offered the job as President of the University of California.

Gobi Desert

The Gobi is in Mongolia and China. It is the largest desert in Asia, and the fifth largest in the world.

The Gobi is a rain shadow desert, caused by the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas shielding it from rain.

The desert basins of the Gobi are bounded by the Altai Mountains and the grasslands and steppes of Mongolia on the north, by the Hexi Corridor and Tibetan Plateau to the southwest, and by the North China Plain to the southeast. The Gobi is made up of several ecological and geographic regions. 

The Gobi is a high plateau with daily and seasonal extremes of temperature.

Seishindo Kenpo

Seishindo Kenpo is an American martial art system of unarmed self-defense. (Seishin" as defined - 精神 せいしん mind), and (Do: - 道 どう The Way), together can be translated into "Way of the Mind". The physical movements come from a combination of Taekwondo and Kenpo Karate or (Kenpo 拳法 けんぽう Chinese art of self-defense, "Fist Law"). Seishindo and Kenpo joined together represent, a sophisticated from of self protection that employs the use of the body own natural weapon against an attack. 
The Seishindo Kenpo Creed, are symbolic words the student of Seishindo Kenpo system follows as a means to guide their path. The Seishindo Kenpo Creed was authored by Frank Landers in 1981 to be included in the Seishindo Kenpo Hand Book. 
The Seishindo Kenpo Creed:
To those of you about to battle with me, prepare to defend yourself! 
I stand before you with my weapons, the art of empty hands! 
I pledge my allegiance to God and Country, and the preservation of the Martial Arts! 
I will protect myself and family, and defend my honor!
Never opposing force with force, but allowing force to defeat itself! 
I will uphold the true spirit of Seishindo Kenpo, which is humility and self-restraint! 
I will never display my knowledge in public, or misuse my skill!
For I have devoted my life to Seishindo Kenpo the skills of Empty Hands. ~ "by Frank Landers"

List of noncommutative topics in mathematics

A list of noncommutative topics in mathematics, based on the Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC) system of the American Mathematical Society, can be divided into 9 main classifications:
Within these classifications, which are to each other, the following noncommutative (NC) topics are included:
One topic in particular, noncommutative geometry (NCG), appears to have taken a life of its own with a distinct MSC classification ( ""a la Connes""). Named after mathematician Alain Connes, a leader in the field of NCG. Note that MSC has two classifications for noncommutative geometry: (58B34 and 81R60), one specifically for Connes. In general broad sense, NCG includes topics such as: algebra; mathematical analysis; geometry and topology; and quantum physics. The central idea in noncommutative geometry is that of quantization versus infinitesimals. While this central idea touches all areas of mathematics, there is clear emphasis on mathematical physics, specifically group theory, Lie algebra theory, matrix theory, and ring theory.

Biofuel

Biofuel is fuel that is obtained from recently lifeless or living biological material. It is different to fossil fuels, which are obtained from long dead biological material. Biofuel can be in forms of solid, liquid or gas. 

Biofuels are usually used to power cars, heat homes and for cooking. Biofuel companies are mainly from Europe, Asia and the Americas. Recent technologies developed at the Los Alamos National Lab even allows pollution to be converted into renewable biofuel. Argofuels are biofuels that are produced from specific crops, rather than from waste processes such as landfill or recycled vegetable oil. 

There are two common ways of producing the liquid and gas version of argofuels. One is to grow crops that are high in sugar (eg. Sugar cane) or starch (eg. corn), and then use yeast to produce ethyl alcohol (ethanol). The second is to grow plants that contain high amounts of vegetable oil, such as oil palm, soybean and algae. When these oils are heated, their viscosity is reduced, and they can be burned directly in a diesel engine, or they can be chemically processed to produce fuels such as biodiesel. Wood and its by-products can also be converted into biofuels such as charcoal, woodgas, methanol or ethanol fuel. It is also possible to make cellulosic ethanol from non-edible plant parts, but this can be difficult to accomplish economically.

Solid biomass is also used. Many materials such as wood and grasses can be dried and pelletised and burnt, and this can be used to produce power.

Ella Fitzgerald

Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917 – June 15, 1996), was an American jazz singer. People also called her "Lady Ella", the "Queen of Jazz" and the "First Lady of Song".

Her voice had a large vocal range (spanning three octaves), which meant that she could sing very high notes and very low notes. She was famous for her scat singing. She is one of the most famous singers of the Great American Songbook.

Fitzgerald's career lasted 59 years. She won 14 Grammy Awards. She was awarded the National Medal of Art by Ronald Reagan and the Presidential Medal of Freedom by George H. W. Bush.

Ella Fitzgerald was born in 1917 in Newport News, Virginia, United States. Her parents were called William and Temperance "Tempie" Fitzgerald. Soon after Fitzgerald was born, her parents separated and she went to live in Yonkers, New York with her mother and her mother's boyfriend, Joseph Da Silva. In 1923, Fitzgerald's half-sister, Frances Da Silva, was born. When she was a child, Fitzgerald was made to live in the Colored Orphan Asylum in Riverdale, the Bronx.

When she was young, Fitzgerald wanted to be a dancer and she loved listening to jazz music by Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby and The Boswell Sisters. She especially liked the lead singer Connee Boswell, later saying, "My mother brought home one of her records, and I fell in love with it...I tried so hard to sound just like her."

In 1932, Fitzgerald's mother died from a heart attack, and she began to do badly at school. At one time, she had a job as a lookout at a bordello (a brothel) and also with some people to do with the Mafia. She got into trouble with the police and was sent to a reform school. She escaped from the reformatory, and for a time was homeless.

Fitzgerald had her first job as a singer when she was 17, on November 21, 1934 at the Harlem Opera House in Harlem, New York. She became popular with the audience at the Apollo and she was able to compete in one of its famous "Amateur Nights". At first she was going to go on stage and dance but, intimidated by some local dancers, she decided to sing instead. She sang Connee Boswell's songs "Judy" and "The Object of My Affection". She won the first prize of US$25.00.

In January 1935, Fitzgerald won the chance to perform for a week with the Tiny Bradshaw band at the Harlem Opera House. She met a drummer and bandleader called Chick Webb here. Webb had already hired a singer called Charlie Linton to work with the band. According to "The New York Times", Webb was "reluctant to sign her...because she was gawky and unkempt, a "diamond in the rough."" Webb let her try singing with his band when they played a dance at Yale University.

Fitzgerald began singing often with Webb's Orchestra during 1935, at Harlem's Savoy Ballroom. She recorded several hit songs with them, including "Love and Kisses" and "(If You Can't Sing It) You'll Have to Swing It (Mr. Paganini)". In 1938 she co-wrote and sang a version of the nursery rhyme, "A-Tisket, A-Tasket". After this, she started getting famous.

Chick Webb died on June 16, 1939, and his band was renamed "Ella Fitzgerald and her Famous Orchestra". Fitzgerald became the bandleader. She recorded nearly 150 sides during her time with the orchestra.
In 1942, Fitzgerald left the band and began to work as a solo singer. She was signed to the Decca label, and she had several popular hit songs. She recording with other musicians like the Ink Spots, Louis Jordan, and the Delta Rhythm Boys.

Decca's Milt Gabler became her manager and she began working often for the jazz producer Norman Granz. She often sang in his Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts. Then, Granz became her manager, but he did not record her on any of his record labels for nearly a decade.

In the mid-1940s, after the Swing era, and the end of the great touring big bands, jazz music became quite different. A new kind of jazz called bebop became popular and Fitzgerald changed her style of singing. She worked with Dizzy Gillespie's big band and started including scat singing as a big part of her performances. About singing with Gillespie, Fitzgerald said, "I just tried to do [with my voice] what I heard the horns in the band doing."

Her 1945 scat recording of "Flying Home" was later described by "The New York Times" as "one of the most influential vocal jazz records of the decade...Where other singers, most notably Louis Armstrong, had tried similar improvisation, no one before Miss Fitzgerald employed the technique with such dazzling inventiveness." Her be-bop recording of "Oh, Lady be Good!" (1947) was also very popular, and made people think of her as one of the most important jazz singers.

Granz did not like some of the music Fitzgerald was given at this time, so during her last years on the Decca label she recorded some duets with pianist Ellis Larkins, released in 1950 as "Ella Sings Gershwin".

In 1955, Fitzgerald left Decca, and joined Granz's new record label, Verve Records. She said later, "I had gotten to the point where I was only singing be-bop. I thought be-bop was 'it', and that all I had to do was go some place and sing bop. But it finally got to the point where I had no place to sing. I realized then that there was more to music than bop. Norman...felt that I should do other things, so he produced "The Cole Porter Songbook" with me. It was a turning point in my life."

A new album, "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook", was released in 1956. It was the first of eight multi-album "Songbook" sets that she would record for Verve between 1956 and 1964. Many of the songs were standards and Fitzgerald tried to cross over into a non-jazz audience.

"Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook" was the only "Songbook" on which the composer of the songs also played with her. Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, who had worked together for a long time, both played on half the set's 38 tracks, and wrote two new pieces of music for the album: "The E and D Blues", and a musical piece about Fitzgerald (the only "Songbook" track that Fitzgerald does not sing on).

The "Songbook" series became the Fitzgerald's most critically acclaimed and popular work. "The New York Times" wrote in 1996, "These albums were among the first pop records to devote such serious attention to individual songwriters, and they were instrumental in establishing the pop album as a vehicle for serious musical exploration."

Ella Fitzgerald also recorded albums of the songs of Cole Porter and George Gershwin in 1972 and 1983. The albums were called "Ella Loves Cole" and "Nice Work If You Can Get It". A later album of songs by a single composer was released when she was with Pablo Records, "Ella Abraça Jobim", with songs by Antonio Carlos Jobim.

While she was recording the "Songbooks" and the occasional studio album, Fitzgerald toured 40 to 45 weeks per year in the United States and internationally, with Norman Granz. Granz helped her to become one of the most important live jazz performers.

In the mid-1950s, Fitzgerald became the first African-American to perform at the Mocambo (a Hollywood nightclub), after Marilyn Monroe had persuaded the owner to make the booking. This was very important in Fitzgerald's career. The event was turned into a play by Bonnie Greer which is to receive a production in London's West End from November 2009.

Some live albums on Verve that she recorded are well thought of by critics: "Ella at the Opera House", "" and "".

Verve Records was sold to MGM in 1963 for $3 million, and in 1967 MGM did not give Fitzgerald another contract. Over the next five years, she recorded with different labels like Atlantic, Capitol and Reprise. Her music at this time is different from her earlier jazz music; for Capitol she recorded "Brighten the Corner", an album of hymns, "Ella Fitzgerald's Christmas", an album of traditional Christmas carols, "Misty Blue", a country and western album, and "30 by Ella", a series of six medleys.

During this time, she had her last US chart single with a cover of Smokey Robinson's "Get Ready", which had already been a hit for The Temptations. After she recorded it, it was also a hit for Rare Earth.

In 1972 she recorded an album called "Jazz at Santa Monica Civic '72", which was successful. Granz started a new record label called Pablo Records. Fitzgerald recorded 20 albums for the label. While she was working with Pablo Records, her voice stopped sounding as good as it used to. She had health problems, and she made her last recording in 1991 and her last public performances in 1993.

Fitzgerald married at least twice, and people think that she may have married three times. In 1941 she married Benny Kornegay, a convicted drug dealer. The marriage was annulled after two years.

In December 1947, she married the famous bass player Ray Brown. She had met him while on tour with Dizzy Gillespie's band a year before. Together they adopted a child of Fitzgerald's half-sister, Frances. They named him Ray Brown, Jr.. Fitzgerald and Brown were both often busy touring and recording, Ray was mostly looked after by Fitzgerald's aunt, Virginia. Fitzgerald and Brown divorced in 1953 but they continued to perform together.

In July 1957, Reuters reported that Fitzgerald had secretly married Thor Einar Larsen, a young Norwegian, in Oslo. She had even furnished an apartment in Oslo, but the affair was quickly forgotten when Larsen was sentenced to five months hard labor in Sweden for stealing money from a young woman.

Fitzgerald was also known for being shy. Trumpet player Mario Bauza, who played behind Fitzgerald when she sang with Chick Webb, remembered that "She didn’t hang out much. When she got into the band, she was dedicated to her music….She was a lonely girl around New York, just kept herself to herself, for the gig." Later in her career, Fitzgerald said, "I don't want to say the wrong thing, which I always do. I think I do better when I sing."

Fitzgerald had diabetes, which caused her to go blind and she had to have both her legs amputated in 1993. In 1996 she died of diabetes in Beverly Hills, California, at the age of 79. She was buried in the Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California. Several of Fitzgerald's awards, significant personal possessions and documents were given to the Smithsonian Institution, the library of Boston University, the Library of Congress, and the Schoenberg Library at UCLA.

I'm been away for a couple of months now, but now am back. I don't know how much time I'll spend here, but I will try to be more involved on the wiki. However, I'm looking forward to getting back to work here. 20:38, 23 August 2009 (UTC)

What makes a computer game notable - is one game more notable than another? I have been looking for guidelines after the poor Moshi Monsters got deleted. Other games eg AdventureQuest RPG seemed to me to be no more or less notable than the Moshis. (I have never had a Moshi Monster nor ever will). Quick discussion on IRC suggested the following as some starting points for establishing notability: third party coverage of the game, news articles about the game, popularity of the game, sales, game rankings on a site like gamespot. Other comments? -- () 00:23, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

With reference to tags on articles... QUALITY QUALITY QUALITY... when an article is 1) Unsourced 2) has no links 3) is complex... it needs a tag. TAgs add articles to the appropriate categories so that we can fix them later. To revert good tags, is a bit disruptive. If consensus is that we don't need tags, then I'll RFD the tag page as unneeded. Either we are 1) Consistent with our editorial policy, or 2) Inconsistent. Very respectfully, () 22:22, 23 August 2009 (UTC)
<-If they exist, we should use them, because that proves that people think we should have them. () 13:47, 24 August 2009 (UTC)
"(or very close to a majority)"? I don't see what's wrong with the tags. I find them informative for editors so they immediately know what's wrong with the article. As for the ugly part, our templates look a lot better than enWP's (I encountered a huge one yesterday). () 14:00, 24 August 2009 (UTC)
If we do keep them, we need to create doc pages for them, so users can know when to add the tags and when not to. For example, do not add tags to stubs, do not add the nofootnotes tag and the unreferenced tag etc. () 14:02, 24 August 2009 (UTC)

To separate out the two discussions lets talk about the viability of just using these tags on talk pages instead of on the article itself in this section. - () 15:04, 24 August 2009 (UTC)



A recent thread (archive 70 bottom thread) talked about desysops by crats. It was supported by 14 users and opposed by 2 (2 users who opposed initially switched sides). I'm guessing that that means that we have consensus for it. How do we get this set up, or has it already happened? () 19:43, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

For some reason, I can't use IRC with Mibbit. When I search for #wikipedia-simple nothing shows up. Anyone know how to use mibbit? -- 23:11, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

Following another fiasco of mine at simplewiki, I invite comments at my . I've written a (hopefully) brief explanatory statement there. Maxim 23:36, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

Today is the day I have to pack the computer. :( I will return soon, but I may not be able to respond or help for a few days. See you'all soon, and good luck. () 04:26, 25 August 2009 (UTC)


In reference to creating mathematical articles, is it the policy of Wikipedia:Simple to only allow elementary simple topics to be created or also allow limitless number of very complex topics and mathematical categories as long as they are written in "simple" language or intuitive concepts? In other words, are there any limits on which mathematical topics can be created? () 05:14, 27 August 2009 (UTC)

I have noticed that at some articles, we have a 'notes' section, and a 'references' section. Usually, the notes section holds notes. But at some articles, the references section contains book sources for the entire article, and the notes section contains the inline citations. Which is correct? I think it's the first one but I want to make sure. () 23:50, 27 August 2009 (UTC)

With the development of the Vector skin and "Beta" interface, it seems more and more of the graphical features on this Wikipedia are looking bad or not working at all. This raises the question of what we should do about it. Given the complexity of the issue, I think the easiest thing would be for us to import/copy the much of the MediaWiki:*.js and *.css files from en to here. Comments? 18:18, 29 August 2009 (UTC)

It looks like some people think I this Wikipedia. The diff above is from a discussion I had with the user Precious Roy, who has since retired. EastvillageGroupie had asked me to tell Precious Roy to 'stop following her around'. In this context, I posted the following on his talk page:
I later removed the line starting "As a side note:.." with the edit comment 'Fix: I am not the only person coordinating.' Note: I changed the bold in my original contribution to "italics". Feel free to comment.-- () 13:22, 30 August 2009 (UTC)

After thinking this through for more than a month now, I have decided to officially retire from this project. This project is going downhill and it is turning into something that I do not like and do not wish to be a part of anymore. I will still be active on the Simple English Wiktionary, though, so if you want to converse with me, feel free to email me or message me on my talk page over there. I just want to say thanks to everyone here and I wish you luck in the future. I believe that this is the right move now, as I am finding myself gravitating more and more away from this project, until I am barely here at all. I now believe that I should devote all of my time to a project that I believe has a better future than this project and one that I believe better suits my capabilities to the best of their abilities. 

Good luck, 20:55, 30 August 2009 (UTC)

Please remove all my flags on this account on this Wikipedia. Rollback, and import. Please also remove rollback from and block Razorflame Public. Thank you, 21:10, 30 August 2009 (UTC)

Well good luck helping SEWiktionary, and I'm leaving too. Good luck to you :D -- 21:17, 30 August 2009 (UTC)

Goodbye, Razorflame! Hopefully you have a good retirement. ( • ) 01:36, 31 August 2009 (UTC)

Hi gang,

Thought i'd just outline my changes to the P(V)GA processes.

In short, I have removed the voting section per . Discussion and consensus building is a much better way of determining what articles are promoted or not, and furthermore it adds in another layer of quality control to ensure that we don't promote crap. Indeed, if it weren't for some vigilant vote closing in the past, this may already have happened.

Proposals now last for up to three weeks, during which stage the article is to be discussed. When a consensus is reached, the article may be either promoted or not promoted, though my personal suggestion would be to let not promoted's run the full three weeks as work will likely be done on them! Hopefully this can make the process a better place.

If you've got any questions, ask, if you've got any objections, please make them. I'd prefer it if the change wasn't undone without discussion, but I won't undo if it is, merely discuss my reasons for it. If there is consensus to undo the changes, then by all means do it, but please, please, please do not make a vote out of it.

Thank you for your time.

I only agree, if all early closures are disallowed in this "new" proccess and all articles have to be there for three weeks. There is no reason to close it after two/three/seven/nine days. It can still be open the full three weeks. So all have a chance to comment there. || 10:49, 30 August 2009 (UTC)

Off topic, but I do see Goblin's point. this diff, which is only available to admins (unless it has been conveniently "vanished") is just one example of ownership issues. () 11:59, 30 August 2009 (UTC)

Should we or should we not link dates? The en MOS says that dates "are not normally linked". I would like to propose that we link dates in the following cases. We should link Birth and Death dates for notable people. These dates would then link to the relevant date page. We should link dates of important events (those that are important enough to have their own page). We have the date pages, lets use them to the full. () 09:20, 31 August 2009 (UTC)
And while we're here, then I would suggest that we reach an understanding that linking individual years is a complete waste of time as well. So Bobby Robson may have be born in 1933, but is it important enough to suggest we link his birth year so we can find out that also in 1933 "Choudhary Rahmat Ali has chosen the name Pakistan in his pamphlet"? Nope. () 19:04, 31 August 2009 (UTC)

Can some creative person create a new editors barnstar, which would be a positive message to new editors who have started to make a regular contribution. Something new and shiny maybe. () 10:26, 7 September 2009 (UTC)

Hi team,

Just letting you know that "The Article Cup" has now begun. The aim is to get as many Good and Very Good articles as you can within three months.

More details can be found , and if you have not signed up then please do so!

Finally, "bonus points" will be given for taking articles from to one of the higher statii.

Regards,

Just a quick straw poll. Is this Wikipedia worthwhile? As far as mainspace edits go, I reckon on less than 100 (without vandalism, and reverts) in the past 12 hours. Is there any point in dragging this out? () 23:50, 4 September 2009 (UTC)
You're right Barras. But the net effect so far of limited discussion has been vandalism, and vandalism reversion and not much else. WMF won't pay for this if things don't change... () 16:49, 5 September 2009 (UTC)

Is there any point to this wiki? Yes, or course there is! But ... the problem is not with the point of such a wiki, it is with the definition of the focus of it. Right now we seem to see ourselves merely as a simplified version of enWP. This is completely WRONG! We should be dealing with material that fulfills an educational need of our readership. We should NOT be dealing with whatever our personal interests are and merely making them more simple and so including them here. For instance, we don't need to worry about sports team rankings within a given season, or epsisodes of a given TV show. Instead we should be dealing with basic topics within, history, geography, science, mathematics, literature, technology and other such educationally relevant materials. We need to remember that we exist because enWP has become TOO complex for many people to find useful; so we fill that gap and take care of that need. Right now we don't, hopefully we will one day. That's why I'm here at least! "my 2p's worth". 02:34, 7 September 2009 (UTC)



Are simple english projects worth while to keep? There has been several attempts in the past to close all SE projects. My opinion about simple english projects is that:
Many people hate SE projects, although there is resistance from closing the projects. () 04:24, 12 September 2009 (UTC)

Hi, my account is not autoconfirmed or confirmed.. can somebody set it as autoconfirmed or confirmed and tell me on my talk page. Thank you! :)

How is possible to edit main page? -- () 11:28, 12 September 2009 (UTC)

Do not allow edits if user is

There should be no article subpages with separate versions in the article mainspace. Why am I seeing article subpages? () 16:38, 12 September 2009 (UTC)
Get on with it then! () 17:28, 12 September 2009 (UTC)


I'm proposing that we cascade protect the Main page. 


Thank you for your consideration, () 00:51, 13 September 2009 (UTC)

Hey there. The earlier proposal (above) has come to a standstill, probably due to the large amount of discussion it entails (getting hung up on one bit, only to forget the rest). Due to this, I'm proposing a discussion on just one section: we change the main deletion focus from to usability -- how useful is the end article to the user? To aid the discussion, I made a flowchart to outline my proposal. Simply put, someone asks just three questions: "Is this article notable? Is it useful? Can we make it useful easily?" -- this will eliminate different in the bud. Regards, 

What should be done with stubs for VGAs, GAs and DYKs? I'm not willing to stop creating stubs, if they are needed for one of these. No one is familar with all topics and can expand and explain all stubs, which s/he need for an other page. Please consider this. || 18:17, 27 August 2009 (UTC)
<-Indeed. Anyways, per my above comments, the more we debate the less real work gets done. () 23:46, 27 August 2009 (UTC)

<doc id="197616" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197616" title="Billie Holiday">
Billie Holiday

She co-wrote some songs which have become jazz standards, like "God Bless the Child", "Don't Explain", and "Lady Sings the Blues". She also became famous for singing jazz standards written by other people, like "Easy Living" and "Strange Fruit".
Holiday was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1915, a Roman Catholic. She had a difficult childhood, which affected her life and career. Not much is known about her early life, but there are stories about it in her autobiography, "Lady Sings the Blues", which was published in 1956. Later, it was found out that some parts of this book were wrong.
Holiday got her pseudonym, or stage name, from Billie Dove, an actress she admired, and Clarence Holiday, the man who was probably her father. At the beginning of her career, she spelled her last name "Halliday", but then changed it back to "Holiday" (they are pronounced the same, 'Hahliday', in American English).

People have never been sure who Holiday's father was. This is because her birth certificate said her father was called Frank DeViese. Some people now think that this was a mistake that somebody made when she was born.

Holiday's mother was called Sadie Fagan. Fagan became pregnant when she was 13 years old. Her parents threw her out of her home in Baltimore, and she went to Philadelphia where her daughter Eleanora (Billie Holiday) was born. Fagan moved back to Baltimore and married Clarence Holiday, who was probably her baby's father, but they later divorced. When she was 10 years old, Holiday often missed school. When she said that she had been raped, she was sent to The House of the Good Shepherd, a Catholic reform school. She was allowed out two years later, with the help of a family friend. Holiday moved to New York City with her mother in 1928. In 1929 Holiday's mother saw a neighbor, Wilbert Rich, raping Holiday. Rich was sentenced to three months in jail.

Holiday later said that in 1930 she worked as a prostitute in a brothel, and was imprisoned for a short time for solicitation (prostitution). In the 1930s in Harlem, New York, she started singing for tips in night clubs, and got a job at Pod's and Jerry's, a famous Harlem jazz club. In 1933 she was working at a club called Monette's. She was discovered by a talent scout called John Hammond.

Hammond helped Holiday to record her first songs in November 1933 with Benny Goodman: "Your Mother's Son-In-Law" and "Riffin' the Scotch". In 1935 she recorded more songs with a group led by pianist Teddy Wilson. They recorded "What a Little Moonlight Can Do" and "Miss Brown To You".

Teddy Wilson was signed to Brunswick Records by John Hammond to record pop songs in the new 'swing' style for jukeboxes. They were allowed to improvise the music. Holiday was very good at improvising the melody line to fit the emotions.

Holiday also wrote songs during the 1930s, like "Billie's Blues", "Tell Me More (And Then Some)", "Everything Happens For The Best", "Our Love Is Different", and "Long Gone Blues".

A tenor saxophonist called Lester Young often accompanied Holiday. He had been a boarder at her mother's house in 1934 and she got on well with him. Young gave her a nickname, "Lady Day" and she called him "Prez." She spent three months working at Clark Monroe's Uptown House in New York in 1937. In the late 1930s, she also worked as a big band singer with Count Basie and Artie Shaw. She was one of the first black women to work with a white orchestra (Artie Shaw's).

In the 1930s, Holiday was recording for Columbia Records. She heard of a song called "Strange Fruit". It was based on a poem about lynching written by Abel Meeropol, a Jewish schoolteacher from the Bronx. The poem had been set to music and was performed at teachers' union meetings. It was heard by a night club owner called Barney Josephson and he told Holiday about it. She sang the song at Josephson's club in 1939. At first she was worried that it might make people angry. She later said that the song reminded her of her father's death, and that this was partly why she did not want to perform it at first. In a 1958 interview, she also said that many people did not understand what the song meant: "They'll ask me to sing that sexy song about the people swinging", she said.

The music producers at Columbia Records thought that subject of the song (the lynching of black people) might upset people. A music producer called Milt Gabler said that Holiday could record it for his label called Commodore Records. That was done in April 1939 and Holiday sang "Strange Fruit" over the next twenty years. The song did not get played on the radio but still sold well. Gabler said that this was because the other side of the record was "Fine and Mellow", which was a jukebox hit. Later, she recorded "Strange Fruit" again for Verve.

In 1944, Holiday went to work, still with Milt Gabler, at Decca Records. She was 29 years old. Her first songs for Decca were called "Lover Man" and "No More". "Lover Man" was a song written for her. It is about a woman who has never known love, and it became one of her biggest hits.

In November 1944, Holiday recorded three songs, "That Ole Devil Called Love", "Big Stuff", and "Don't Explain". Holiday wrote "Don't Explain" after she caught her husband, Jimmy Monroe, with lipstick on his collar. After that, Holiday didn't record any songs until August 1945. She recorded, "Don't Explain", "Big Stuff", "You Better Go Now", and "What is This Thing Called Love?". In 1946, she recorded songs called "No Good Man" and "Good Morning Heartache", "The Blues Are Brewin", and "Guilty". In February 1947, Holiday recorded two hits, "There Is No Greater Love" and "Deep Song". She also recorded "Solitude" and "Easy Living", songs that she had recorded with Teddy Wilson in the 1930s.

Holiday's next recording was after she came out of prison in 1948. She recorded this time with a vocal group called the Stardusters. She recorded "Weep No More" and "Girls Were Made to Take Care of Boys". She was worried that people wouldn't like the recordings and recorded two more songs without the group, "My Man" and Gershwin's "I Loves You Porgy". These became very popular.

The next year, Billie had more hits. She sang a version of Bessie Smith's, song "T'Ain't Nobody's Business if I Do", "Gimme A Pigfoot (And A Bottle of Beer)", "Do Your Duty", and "Keeps on Rainin'", to her lush "You're My Thrill" and "Crazy He Calls Me". She also recorded a song that she wrote called "Sombody's On My Mind".

In her last recording in 1950, she recorded two songs. Both of them were backed by strings, horns, and a choir. She recorded her own "God Bless the Child" and "This is Heaven to Me".

In 1947, Holiday was in a film with Louis Armstrong called "New Orleans". The musical drama film featured Holiday singing with Armstrong and his band and was directed by Arthur Lubin. Holiday was not pleased that she had to play a maid. In her autobiography she said:
"I thought I was going to play myself in it. I thought I was going to be Billie Holiday doing a couple of songs in a nightclub setting and that would be that. I should have known better. When I saw the script, I did. You just tell one Negro girl who's made movies who didn't play a maid or a whore. I don't know any. I found out I was going to do a little singing, but I was still playing the part of a maid."
Holiday was also in the 1950 Universal-International short film "'Sugar Chile' Robinson, Billie Holiday, Count Basie and His Sextet", where she sang "God Bless the Child" and "Now, Baby or Never".
On May 16, 1947, Holiday was arrested for the possession of narcotics and drugs in her New York apartment. On May 27, 1947, she had to go to court. Holiday pleaded guilty (admitted that she had the drugs) and was sentenced to Alderson Federal Prison Camp in West Virginia. Holiday said she never "sang a note" at Alderson even though people wanted her to. She was released early (March 16, 1948) because of her good behavior. When she arrived at Newark, everybody was there to welcome her back, including her pianist Bobby Tucker.

Her manager Ed Fishman thought of the idea to have a comeback concert at Carnegie Hall. Holiday was worried at first because she thought that nobody would want her back, but she decided do it. On March 27, 1948, the Carnegie concert was very successful. She did sang songs like Cole Porter's "Night and Day" and "Strange Fruit". The concert was not recorded.

Holiday was arrested again on January 22, 1949, at a hotel in San Francisco.

Holiday said that she began using hard drugs in the early 1940s. She had married trombonist Jimmy Monroe on August 25, 1941. When she was still married to Monroe, she started a romantic relationship with trumpeter Joe Guy, who was also her drug dealer. She lived with him as his wife (called a common law wife) and divorced Monroe in 1947. She also separated from Guy. After of she was arrested and convicted for possessing drugs in 1947, she was not allowed to work in clubs in New York for the rest of her life. The only time she was able to was when she sang at the Ebony Club in 1948, where she had the permission of John Levy.

In the 1950s, Holiday's health became bad, because of her drinking alcohol, using drugs and her relationships with abusive men. Her voice became rough, but some people say that her singing became more emotional.

On March 28, 1952, Holiday married Louis McKay, a man who worked for the Mafia. McKay, like most of the men in her life, was abusive, but he did try to get her to stop using drugs. They later separated.

On November 10, 1956, she performed two concerts before big audiences at Carnegie Hall. 

Holiday went on tour Europe for the first time in 1954 with Buddy DeFranco and Red Norvo. When she went back to Europe, almost five years later, she went on television for Granada's "Chelsea at Nine", in London. This was one of the last times she was on television. Her last studio recordings were made for MGM in 1959, with Ray Ellis and his Orchestra, who had also accompanied her on Columbia's "Lady in Satin" album 
in 1958. The MGM recordings were released after Holiday's death on an album called "Last Recordings". 

Holiday's autobiography, "Lady Sings the Blues", was published in 1956. It was ghostwritten by William Dufty, a "New York Post" writer and editor who was married to Holiday's close friend Maely Dufty. He wrote the book quickly after talking to Holiday in his apartment, as well as using earlier interviewers. His wanted to let Holiday tell her story her way.

Holiday never had any children of her own, but had two godchildren: singer Billie Lorraine Feather, daughter of Leonard Feather, and Bevan Dufty, son of William Dufty.

On May 31, 1959, Holiday was taken to the Metropolitan Hospital in New York. She had liver and heart disease. Police officers were at the door to her room. She was arrested for drug possession as she lay dying and her hospital room was raided by the police. They kept guarding her at the hospital until she died from cirrhosis of the liver on July 17, 1959. In the last years of her life, she had gradually lost her earnings, and she died with $0.70 in the bank and $750 in cash.

Nina Simone

Nina Simone (born Eunice Kathleen Waymon; February 21, 1933 – April 21, 2003) was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, arranger and civil rights activist. Simone did not like people to classify her music, or say what genre it fell into, but people often call her a jazz musician. She was often called "The High Priestess of Soul".
Nina Simone was born Eunice Kathleen Waymon in Tryon, North Carolina in 1933. She was one of eight children in a poor family. She began playing the piano when she was age of three. The first song she learned was "God be With You, Till we Meet Again" and she played at her local church. Her first concert was a classical piano recital, when she was twelve. Her parents sat on the front row to watch her, but were made to move to the back of the hall to make way for white people. Simone said she would not to play until her parents were moved back to the front. She remembered this event later when she got involved with the civil rights movement.

Simone's mother, Mary Kate Waymon was a strict Methodist minister. Her father, John Divine Waymon, was a handyman, and sometimes a barber, who was often ill. Mrs. Waymon worked as a maid and her employer, hearing of Simone's talent, gave them money for piano lessons. After that, a local fund was made to help in carrying on her education. When she was 17, Simone moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
She found more racism here when she applied for a scholarship at a local college. She had to take a test, and passed it, but she was not given the scholarship. When she asked the examiner why she was not given a scholarship, the examiner told her "because you're black."

After this, Simone became very passionate about the civil rights movement. She began to earn money teaching piano and accompanying singers. This money helped her to study at the Juilliard School of Music in New York. She applied to study piano at the Curtis Institute, but was not successful. She believed that this too was because she was black, and because she was a woman.

Simone played the piano at the Midtown Bar & Grill on Pacific Avenue in Atlantic City to earn money for her studying. The owner said that she would only get the job if she would sing as well as play the piano. She did not want her mother to know that she was playing "the devil's music", so she started using the stage name Nina Simone. She got "Nina" from a nickname given to her by a boyfriend, and "Simone" from a French actress called Simone Signoret. Simone played and sang a mixture of jazz, blues and classical music at the bar. She began to get fans. 
In 1958 she recorded a song called "I Loves You Porgy", from "Porgy and Bess" by George Gershwin. She had learned the song from a Billie Holiday album, and performed it as a favor for a friend. It became her only Billboard top 40 success in the United States. Soon, she recorded her first album "Little Girl Blue" on Bethlehem Records. Simone never earned money from the album because she sold the rights for $3000, missing out on more than $1 million of royalties.

Simone then signed a contract with the record company Colpix Records and released several studio and live albums. Colpix let her have control over choosing the material that she recorded. Simone made sure she had control and did not really mind whether she had a recording contract or not. She only played pop music to make money for her classical music studies.
In 1964, Simone began to work with the Dutch record label Philips. She began to record songs about her African-American origins and racial inequality. She recorded a live album called "Nina Simone In Concert" which included the song "Mississippi Goddam". It was about the murder of Medgar Evers and the bombing of a church in Birmingham, Alabama that killed four black children. The song was boycotted in some southern states. With "Old Jim Crow" on the same album she reacts to the Jim Crow Laws.

After that, a civil rights was a common theme in Simone's songs. Simone performed and spoke at many civil rights meetings, like the Selma to Montgomery marches. She sang a version Billie Holiday's song "Strange Fruit" (on "Pastel Blues"), a song about the lynching of black men in the South. She also a poem by W. Cuney called "Images" on her 1966 album "Let It All Out", about the lack of pride in African-American women. Simone wrote "Four Women", a song about four different stereotypes of African-American women. It was on her 1966 album "Wild Is the Wind"

Simone moved from Philips to RCA Victor in 1967. She sang "Backlash Blues", written by her friend Langston Hughes on her first RCA album, "Nina Simone Sings The Blues". On "Silk & Soul" she recorded Billy Taylor's "I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free" and "Turning Point". The 1968 album "Nuff Said" has some live recordings from the Westbury Music Fair, April 7, 1968, three days after the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr. She dedicated the whole performance to him and sang "Why? (The King Of Love Is Dead)". This was a song written by her bass player straight after they heard the news of King's death. 

Together with Weldon Irvine, Simone turned Lorraine Hansberry's unfinished play "To Be Young, Gifted and Black" into a civil rights song. She performed it live on her 1970 album "Black Gold". A studio recording was released as a single, and the song has been covered by Aretha Franklin and Donny Hathaway.

Simone left the United States in September 1970. She flew to Barbados. She thought that her husband and manager, Andrew Stroud, would tell her when she had to perform again. However, Stroud thought that Simone's sudden disappearance (and the fact that she had left behind her wedding ring) meant that she wanted a divorce. As her manager, Stroud was also in charge of Simone's income. This meant that after their separation Simone did not know anything about how her business was managed and what she was actually worth. When she came back to the United States, she found out that she was wanted for not paying taxes. She went back to Barbados again to get away from the authorities and prosecution. She stayed in Barbados for quite some time, and had a long affair with the Prime Minister, Errol Barrow. A close friend, singer Miriam Makeba, persuaded her to go to Liberia in Africa. After that she lived in Switzerland and the Netherlands. She went to live in France in 1992.

She recorded her last album for RCA Records, "It Is Finished", during 1974. In 1978 CTI Records owner Creed Taylor persuaded her to record another album, "Baltimore". This album got good reviews, but did not make much money. Four years later Simone recorded "Fodder On My Wings" on a French record label. During the 1980s Simone performed regularly at Ronnie Scott's jazz club in London. She recorded an album there in 1984 called "Live at Ronnie Scott's". On stage, Simone often seemed to be haughty and aloof but seemed to enjoy talking to her audiences. In 1987, her 1958 song "My Baby Just Cares For Me" was used in an advert for Chanel No. 5 perfume in the UK. After that, the song was released again and it went to number 5 in the UK singles chart, making Simone more popular in the UK. Her autobiography, "I Put a Spell on You", was published in 1992 and she recorded her last album, "A Single Woman," in 1993.
In 1993 Simone went to live near Aix-en-Provence in Southern France. She was ill with breast cancer for several years. She died in her sleep at her home in Carry-le-Rouet, Bouches-du-Rhône on April 21, 2003. Her funeral service was attended by singers Miriam Makeba and Patti LaBelle, poet Sonia Sanchez, actor Ossie Davis and hundreds of other people. Elton John sent a flowers with the message "We were the greatest and I love you". Simone's ashes were scattered in several African countries. She left behind a daughter, Lisa Celeste, who is now an actress and singer who took on the stage name Simone.

Star cluster

A star cluster is a group of stars. They are held together by the gravitational attraction of the stars, which are related all through common origin. There are two major types of clusters: open (also called galactic) clusters and gobular clusters. Globular clusters are tight groups of hundreds and thousands of very old stars. Open clusters are more loose, and they have less than a few hundred stars, which are often very young. A famous star cluster is the Pleiades, which is an open cluster.

Bessie Smith

Bessie Smith (July 9, 1892 or April 15, 1894 – September 26, 1937) was an American blues singer. She was sometimes called "The Empress of the Blues" and was very popular in the 1920s and 1930s. A lot of people think that she was one of the best singers of her time, and along with Louis Armstrong, she was an important influence on later jazz singers.
In the 1900 American census, Bessie Smith's mother, Laura Smith, said that Bessie was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee in July 1892. In the census in 1910, her sister, Viola Smith said that Bessie's birthday was April 15, 1894. That is the date that is on all later documents, and was the one that Smith used.

She was the daughter of Laura and William Smith. William Smith was a laborer and part-time Baptist preacher who died before his daughter was old enough to remember him. By the time she was nine, her mother had died as well, and her older sister Viola had to look after for her sisters and brothers. 

To earn money for their poor family, Smith and her brother Andrew began Busking (performing) on the streets of Chattanooga as a duo. She sang and danced, and he accompanied her on guitar. They liked to perform in front of the White Elephant Saloon in the middle of Chattanooga's African-American community.

In 1904, Smith's oldest brother, Clarence, ran away from home and joined small traveling troupe owned by Moses Stokes. "If Bessie had been old enough, she would have gone with him," said Clarence's widow, Maud. "That's why he left without telling her, but Clarence told me she was ready, even then. Of course, she was only a child."

In 1912, Clarence came back to Chattanooga with the Stokes troupe and helped Smith get an audition. She got a job as a dancer, not a singer, because the company already had a singer called Ma Rainey.

By the early 1920s, Smith starred a musical called "How Come?" with Sidney Bechet. The musical went to Broadway. Smith had an argument with the producer of "How Come?" and she was replaced by Alberta Hunter. Smith went back to Philadelphia, where she now lived. She met and fell in love with a security guard called Jack Gee. They got married on June 7, 1923. At this time, Smith made her first song recordings with Columbia Records. Her marriage was difficult and both of them had affairs.

Smith became the biggest headliner on the black Theater Owners Booking Association circuit. She ran a show that sometimes had as many as 40 people and made her the highest-paid black entertainer of her day. Gee liked the money she was earning, but did not like her show business life. In particular, he did not like the fact that Smith was bisexual. In 1929, Smith found out that Gee was having an affair with another performer called Gertrude Saunders. Smith separated from Gee but they never got divorced. Smith went to live with a man called Richard Morgan, as is they were husband and wife. He was an old friend and the uncle of a jazz musician called Lionel Hampton. Smith and Morgan stayed together for the rest of her life.
Ma Rainey helped Smith to get better as a performer, but she did not teach her to sing. Smith began started her own act around 1913, at Atlanta's "81" Theatre. By 1920 she had got a good reputation in the South and along the Eastern Seaboard.

In 1920, a singer called Mamie Smith recorded a song called "Crazy Blues,". This was one of the first blues songs recorded by an African-American singer, and was very popular. The recording industry realised that there were lots of black people who would buy blues records. Smith was signed by Columbia Records in 1923 when the label decided to make a "race records" series.

Her first recording, a coupling of "Gulf Coast Blues" and "Downhearted Blues," was very popular. Smith became a headliner on the black T.O.B.A. circuit and was its top attraction in the 1920s. She worked very hard, in theatres during the winter, and touring for the rest of the year. She became the highest-paid black entertainer of her day. Somebody from Columbia Records gave her a nickname, "Queen of the Blues". Soon, the press were calling her the "Empress of the Blues". 

She made about 160 recordings for Columbia, often accompanied by other popular musicians like Louis Armstrong, James P. Johnson, Joe Smith, Charlie Green, and Fletcher Henderson.

On September 26, 1937, Smith was seriously injured in a car accident while traveling between Memphis, Tennessee, and Clarksdale, Mississippi. Her boyfriend Richard Morgan was driving. People think he might have fallen asleep at the wheel or that he could not tell what speed a slow-moving truck was driving in front of him. Tire marks at the scene showed that Morgan tried not to hit the truck by driving around its left side but he hit the back of the truck side-on very fast. Smith, who was in the passenger seat, was hit worst in the crash. Morgan did not have any major injuries. One of the first people to see her after the crash was a doctor. He said that she had a bad injury to her arm which made her lose a lot of blood. She also had bad injuries to the side of her body, and was in shock.

An ambulance took Smith to Clarksdale's Afro-American Hospital and her right arm was amputated (taken off). She did not wake up and died that morning. After she died, some people said that it was because a hospital for white people would not treat her, but in those days, an amubulance driver would never have taken a black person to a "White's only" hospital at all.

Roe Deer

The Roe Deer or ("Capreolus capreolus") is a deer species of Europe and Asia Minor. It is also called European Roe Deer to not confuse it with the related Asian species, the Siberian Roe Deer ("Capreolus pygargus").

The Roe Deer is a smaller deer. In the summer its fur is reddish-brown, in the winter it is greyish brown or dark brown. Fawns have a reddish-brown fur, with white spots on their back and sides. 

Male Roe Deer have antlers, which are small compared to other deer species. The antlers can become up to 20-25 cm (8-10 in) long, with two or three (rarely four) points.

The Roe Deer lives in Europe, Asia Minor, and the coastal regions of the Caspian Sea.

Roe deer mate during July and August. After 10 months the female gives birth to 1-3 (usually 2) fawns, usually in May/June. They become mature when they are 1 1/2 year old. Roe Deer can live up to 10-12 years in the wild, in captivity up to 17 years.

SR-71 Blackbird

The SR-71 Blackbird is a supersonic reconnaissance aircraft. It was built by Lockheed's "Skunk Works" in the 1960s for the United States Air Force (USAF). 

The Blackbird was designed to fly at more than Mach 3 – three times the speed of sound. This meant it would become very hot during flight. To help with this, most of the aircraft was made of titanium. Radar absorbing material was also used to make the aircraft more difficult to .

SR-71 Blackbird used a special fuel called JP-7. Before the flight, the fuel tanks used to leak. This is because at ground altitude the tolerances (distance between parts of the fuel tank) were larger than at the plane's cruising altitude. Once in the air, because of the speed and air resistance, the parts became very hot. Because of this heat, the distance between the parts shrank stopping the loss of fuel.

The aircraft also had cameras and radars fitted to take photographs of targets.

The first Blackbird flight happened on 22 December 1964 in Palmdale, California. In January 1966, the first aircraft entered service with the USAF. No aircraft were lost in war but one crashed in an accident in 1969. Only 32 aircraft were built. Its final flight was on 6 March 1990, Blackbird S/N 61-7972. The SR-71 program was retired from service in 1998.

The aircraft flew at an altitude of over 80,000 feet (24,000 m) and at speeds over 2,190 miles per hour (3,520 km/h). It held the world record for the jet-powered flight, flying at Mach 3.2. The record was broken in March 2004 by NASA's X-43A aircraft.

The SR-71 Blackbird had two crew members. It could carry 3,500 lb (1,600 kg) of equipment.

Main sequence

The main sequence is a region on a Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram where most stars appear. Any star that is plotted within that area is a main-sequence star. The Sun is a main-sequence star. Most of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy and most other galaxies are also main-sequence stars.

Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams are graphs that measure each star's brightness against its temperature or color. The main sequence appears as a band going from the upper-left (hot and bright) to the lower-right (cooler and less bright). You can see an example of the band of main-sequence stars to the right.

Stars are created from nebula and first appear on the main sequence. They stay on the main sequence for millions or billions of years. When a star begins to run out of fuel, it gets much bigger and colder and turns into a red giant. After this happens, the star is no longer on the main sequence.

In general, the hottest and brightest stars (in the upper-left of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram) also have the most mass. The main sequence is sometimes divided into two parts. Any star that has a mass greater than 1.5 times the Sun's mass is grouped into the "upper main sequence"; any star with a mass lower than 1.5 solar masses belongs to the "lower main sequence".

Stars get the energy they produce through nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. The upper main sequence (hot and bright with the most mass) produces energy by one type of nuclear fusion involving only hydrogen and helium. The lower main sequence (cooler and less bright with a lower mass) produces energy by another type of nuclear fusion. This type uses other elements (for example, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen) with higher atomic numbers as nuclear catalysts.

Because of these different types of fusion, stars on the lower main sequence last much longer than stars on the upper main sequence. Our Sun is located on the lower main sequence and is predicted to last between 10 and 12 billion years. A star located on the upper main sequence may only last a few "million" years.

Nowadays, a new star may be classified as main sequence strictly by its color. A main sequence star of a particular color would have a narrow band of brightness when seen from a standard distance. An astronomer could compute the distance to this newly-discovered star by comparing its brightness as seen from Earth against the brightness for a certain color on the main sequence.

Kennedy Family

The Kennedys have been a famous family in American politics and have had several members chosen to important positions in the U.S. Government. The Kennedys are Irish Catholic Democrats and mostly live in Boston and Hyannisport, Massachusetts

Joseph P. Kennedy (1888-1969) was the son of Irish who were in the Democrats. He married Rose Fitzgerald (1890-1995), the daughter of the mayor of Boston. He was a businessman and made lots and lots of money. He was friends with Franklin D. Roosevelt and served as the U.S.' man in Great Britain. He wanted to create a family of powerful politicians, and succeeded. 

Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. (1915-1944) was the oldest of the Kennedy children. His father had wanted him to go into politics, but before that happened, he was killed in a plane crash in World War II

John F. Kennedy (1917-1963) served in the Navy in World War II and then went to politics. He served in the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate before being elected President in 1960. He was shot and killed in 1963.

Rose Kennedy (1918-2005) had mental illness. Part of her brain was cut off and she was placed in a mental hospital.

Kathleen Kennedy (1920-1948) married an English nobleman, was widowed and died in a plane crash.

Astrometry

Astrometry is a part of astronomy that has to do with measuring the motion of objects in space such as stars. Two main ways to measure these objects are proper motion and parallax.

Proper motion is an object’s change in position over time when seen from the Earth. Just like anything else that moves, a star's proper motion is measured by looking towards the same place at different times and seeing how far the star has moved. The difference with stars is that, from Earth, they seem to move very slowly so we have to measure in arcseconds per year. When a star has a large proper motion, it usually means that it is nearby. Barnard’s Star, the star with the largest proper motion, only moves 1 degree across the sky (3600 arcseconds) in 348 years.

Parallax is the apparent difference in position of an object when seen from two or more different places. When an object is seen from a new place, there is a new line of sight going from the viewer to the object showing a different background in the distance. Parallax is measured using the angle between two lines of sight.

Parallax can also be used to measure distances to the nearest few thousand stars. These distances are measured in parsecs which are equal to about 3.26 light years.

<doc id="197990" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197990" title="Count Basie">
Count Basie

William "Count" Basie (August 21, 1904 – April 26, 1984) was an American jazz pianist, organist, bandleader, and composer. He was one of the most important jazz bandleaders of his time. He led his popular Count Basie Orchestra for almost 50 years. Many important musicians came to became popular and successful with his help, like tenor saxophonists Lester Young and Herschel Evans, trumpeters Buck Clayton and Harry "Sweets" Edison and singers Jimmy Rushing and Joe Williams. Basie's famous songs were "One O'Clock Jump" and "April In Paris".
William James Basie was born in 1904 in New Jersey. His parents were Harvey Lee Basie and Lillian Ann Childs, who lived on Mechanic Street in Red Bank, New Jersey. His father worked as a coachman and caretaker for a rich judge. After automobiles (cars) became more popular than using horses to get around, his father became a groundskeeper and handyman for some families in the area. His mother was a piano player and she gave Basie his first piano lessons. To earn money, she took in laundry to wash and baked cakes for sale.

Basie was not very interested in school. He dreamed of a traveling, inspired by the carnivals which came to town. He only got as far as junior high school. He helped out at the Palace theater in Red Bank, to get into the shows for free. He also learned to use the spotlights for the vaudeville shows. One day, when the pianist did not arrive in time for the show, Basie played instead. He soon learned to improvise music for silent movies.

Basie was very good at the piano, but he liked drums better. There was another drummer in Red Bank who was better, called Sonny Greer, so Basie stopped playing drums and just played piano. They played together until Greer started his professional career. Basie played with different groups for dances, resorts, and amateur shows, like Harry Richardson’s "Kings of Syncopation". When he was not playing a gig, he spent time at the local pool hall with other musicians. He got some jobs in Asbury Park, playing at the Hong Kong Inn, until a better player took his place.
Around 1924, Basie went to Harlem, New York City. A lot of jazz was being played there. He liced down the block from the Alhambra Theater. Soon after he went to Harlem, he met Sonny Greer again, who was now the drummer for the Washingtonians, Duke Ellington's early band. Soon, Basie met many Harlem musicians, like Willie "the Lion" Smith and James P. Johnson.

Basie toured in some acts between 1925 and 1927, as a soloist and accompanist to blues singers Katie Krippen and Gonzelle White. He went to Kansas City, St. Louis, New Orleans, and Chicago. He met many great jazz musicians, like Louis Armstrong.

Back in Harlem in 1925, Basie got his first regular job at Leroy’s, a place known for its piano players, where lots of celebrities went. The band usually played without sheet music. He met Fats Waller, who was playing organ at the Lincoln Theater, accompanying silent movies, and Waller taught him how to play the organ. Willie "the Lion" Smith helped Basie out when there was not much work, arranging gigs at house-rent parties, where he met other important musicians.

In 1928 Basie was in Tulsa and heard Walter Page and his Famous Blue Devils, one of the first big bands, which had Jimmy Rushing singing. A few months later, Basie was asked to join the band, which played mostly in Texas and Oklahoma. He began to be known as "Count" Basie.

In 1929, Basie started playing with the Bennie Moten band, Kansas City. The Moten band was classier and more respected than the Blue Devils. They played in a style called the Kansas City stomp. As well as playing piano, Basie also arranged music with Eddie Durham. When they were staying in Chicago, Basie recorded with the band. He sometimes played four-hand piano and dual pianos with Moten. The band got better when they added a saxophone player called Ben Webster.

The band voted Moten out and Basie became the leader. The band was now called "Count Basie and his Cherry Blossoms". Later he went to join Moten's new band. Moten died in 1935 and the band did not stay together. Basie made a new band, which included many of the musicians from Moten's band. Lester Young, a saxophone player, also joined. They played at the Reno Club and sometimes on local radio. One night the band started improvising a piece which Basie called "One O'Clock Jump". It became his signature tune.

List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions

The Formula One World Constructors' Championship (WCC) is awarded the most successful constructor of the year. The award is given by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) to the constructor scoreing the most points during a season. The Constructors' Championship was first awarded in 1958, to Vanwall.

For the purposes of the Championship, different combinations of car makes and engines are different constructors . Constructors' Championship points are awarded by adding the points scored in each race by all the drivers for that constructor. For most seasons up until 1979, a constructor was awarded only the points from the highest-scoring driver in each race. 

In the 51 seasons the Championship has been awarded, only 13 different constructors have won it. Scuderia Ferrari has been the most successful with 16 titles. Only ten times has the World Drivers' Champion come from a team that did not win the World Constructors' Champion the same year.

Heavy machine gun

Heavy machine gun is a term used to describe automatic firearms which are of 7.62mm or 30 caliber or higher. The rounds fired by a heavy machine gun range in size from 7.62mm x 51mm, up to the 50 cal, which is 12.7mm x 99mm. The Russians have a 14.5mm caliber machine gun. However, traditionally the term heavy machine gun is used only for 50 cal.

The West Wing

The West Wing is an American television drama created by Aaron Sorkin that was originally shown from September 22, 1999 to May 14, 2006. The series is set in the West Wing of the White House—where the Oval Office and offices of presidential staff are located—during the fictional presidency of Josiah Bartlet (played by Martin Sheen).

It first aired on NBC in 1999, and has been shown on many networks in several other countries. The series ended its seven years on television on May 14, 2006.

The show received positive reviews from critics, political science teachers, and former White House workers. In total, "The West Wing" won three Golden Globe Awards and 27 Emmy Awards, including the award for Outstanding Drama Series, which it won four times in a row from 2000 through 2003. The show's ratings were lower in later years, series creator Aaron Sorkin (who wrote or co-wrote 85 of the first 88 episodes) left the show after the fourth season. It was still popular with viewers who have a high-income.

The series was created by Aaron Sorkin. Sorkin served as executive producer for the first episode with director Thomas Schlamme and John Wells. Kristin Harms and Llewellyn Wells were producers for the first episode. Michael Hissrich acted as a co-producer.

The first season proper saw the return of all of the pilot production team along with the addition of Ron Osborn and Jeff Reno as consulting producers and Rick Cleveland as a second co-producer with Robert W. Glass as an associate producer. Glass left the production team after only five episodes. Osborn and Reno departed after nine episodes. Paul Redford served as a story editor throughout the first season. Lawrence O'Donnell, Jr. worked as executive story editor for the second half of the season.

With the second season Kevin Falls became a co-executive producer. Cleveland left the production team and Redford and O'Donnell were promoted to co-producer. Peter Parnell, and Patrick Caddell became co-producers and Julie Herlocker and Mindy Kanaskie became associate producers. O'Donnell was promoted again to producer five episodes into the season and Hissrich joined him twelve episodes into the season.

The third season saw the departure of Parnell, Caddell, and Herlocker and the temporary absence of O'Donnell. Director Christopher Misiano became a supervising producer and Patrick Ward came aboard as an associate producer. Redford was promoted to producer. With the thirteenth episode of the third season director Alex Graves became an additional supervising producer and Eli Attie joined the writing staff as a story editor.

The fourth season marked the temporary departure of Hissrich. Misiano and Graves became co-executive producers alongside Falls. Attie was promoted to executive story editor and Debora Cahn became a staff writer. The fourteenth episode of the season saw Redford promoted to supervising producer and Kanaskie, Ward and Attie promoted to co-producers.

The fifth season saw the departure of both Sorkin and Schlamme as executive producers. Schlamme remained attached to the series as an executive consultant. John Wells remained the sole executive producer and showrunner. Co-executive producer Kevin Falls also left the show. O'Donnell rejoined the production team as a consulting producer. Wells also added Carol Flint, Alexa Junge, Peter Noah and John Sacret Young as consulting producers. Andrew Stearn came aboard as a producer and Attie was promoted to producer. Cahn became story editor and Josh Singer replaced her as staff writer. With the tenth episode Flint, Junge, Noah and Sacret Young became supervising producers.

With the sixth season Misiano and Graves were promoted to executive producers. Redford and Junge left the production team and Dylan K. Massin became a co-producer. Cahn was promoted to executive story editor and Singer replaced her as story editor. Lauren Schmidt filled the staff writer role. The fourth episode saw the departure of original crew member Llewellyn Wells. Debora Cahn was promoted to co-producer with the fourteenth episode.

The seventh season saw Noah and O'Donnell promoted again, this time becoming additional executive producers. Attie became a supervising producer. Hissrich returned to his role as producer for the final season.

"The West Wing" employed a broad ensemble cast to portray the many positions involved in the daily work of the federal government. The President, the First Lady, and the President's senior staff and advisors form the core cast. Numerous secondary characters, appearing intermittently, complement storylines that generally revolve around this core group.

Each of the main actors made about $75,000 an episode, with Sheen's most recently confirmed salary being $300,000. Rob Lowe also had a six-figure salary, reported to be $100,000, because his character originally was supposed to have a more central role. Disparities in cast salaries led to very public contract disputes, particularly by Janney, Schiff, Spencer, and Whitford. During contract negotiations in 2001, the four were threatened with breach of contract suits by Warner Bros. However, by banding together, they were able to persuade the studio to more than double their salaries. Two years later, the four again demanded a doubling of their salaries, a few months after Warner Bros. had signed new licensing deals with NBC and Bravo.

John Spencer, who played Leo McGarry, died from a heart attack on December 16, 2005 — about a year after his character experienced a nearly fatal heart attack on the show. A brief memorial message from Martin Sheen ran before "Running Mates", the first new episode that aired after Spencer's death. The loss of Spencer's character was addressed by the series beginning with the episode "Election Day", which aired on April 2, 2006.

Different performers had been originally considered for many of the roles. Bradley Whitford states in an interview on the Season 1 DVD that he was originally cast as Sam, though the character of Josh was the role Whitford had wanted and for which he had auditioned. In addition, Josh's character had been written specifically for him by Aaron Sorkin. In the same interview, Janel Moloney states that she had originally auditioned for the role of C.J., and that the role she eventually received, Donna, was not meant to be a recurring character. Other actors who were seriously considered included Alan Alda and Sidney Poitier for the President, Judd Hirsch for Leo, Eugene Levy for Toby, and CCH Pounder for C.J.

"The West Wing", like many serial dramas, stretches storylines over several episodes or entire seasons. In addition to these larger storylines, each episode also contains smaller arcs which usually begin and end within an episode.

Most episodes follow President Bartlet and his staff through particular legislative or political issues. Plots can range from behind-closed-doors negotiating with Congress ("Five Votes Down") to personal issues like sex ("Pilot", "Take out the Trash Day") and personal drug use (a major plotline throughout the first and second seasons). The typical episode loosely follows the president and his staff through their day, generally following several plots connected by some idea or theme. A large, fully connected set of the White House allows the producers to create shots with very few cuts and long, continuous master shots of staff members walking and talking through the hallways. These "walk and talks" became a trademark of the show. The final two seasons presented a narrative change, with the focus of the show divided between plots in the West Wing with President Bartlet and his remaining senior staffers and plots revolving around the rest of the main cast on the campaign trail for the 2006 election.


The series developed following the success of 1995 theatrical film "The American President", for which Aaron Sorkin wrote the screenplay, and Martin Sheen played the White House Chief of Staff. Unused plot elements from the film and a suggestion from Akiva Goldsman inspired Sorkin to create "The West Wing". 

According to the DVD commentary, Sorkin intended to center the show on Sam Seaborn and the other senior staff with the president in an unseen or a secondary role. However, Bartlet's screen time gradually increased, and his role expanded as the series progressed. Positive critical and public reaction to Sheen's performance raised his character's profile, decreasing Lowe's perceived significance. In addition, according to Sorkin, the storylines began to focus less on Sam and more on Josh Lyman, the deputy chief of staff. This shift is one of the reasons for Lowe's eventual departure from the show in the fourth season.
For the first four seasons, Sorkin wrote almost every episode of the series, occasionally reusing plot elements, episode titles, character names, and actors from his previous work, "Sports Night", a sitcom in which he began to develop his signature dialogue style of rhythmic, snappy, and intellectual banter. Fellow executive producer and director Thomas Schlamme championed the "walk and talk," a continuous shot tracking in front of the characters as they walk from one place to another that became part of "The West Wing"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s signature visual style. Sorkin's hectic writing schedule often led to cost overruns and schedule slips, and he opted to leave the show after the fourth season, following increasing personal problems, including an arrest for possession of illegal drugs. Thomas Schlamme also left the show after the fourth season. John Wells, the remaining executive producer, took the helm after their departure.

The show aired its series finale on Sunday, May 14, 2006. It had suffered a significant ratings fall after being placed in the same timeslot as ABC's Top 20 hit "", and CBS' Top 30 hit "Cold Case".

"The West Wing" offers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the White House, and the show's legitimacy, political slant, and film merits have generated considerable discussion.

"The West Wing" is not completely accurate in its portrayal of the actual West Wing; however, former White House staffers agree that the show "captures the feel [of the West Wing], shorn of a thousand undramatic details."

Former White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers as well as expert pollster Patrick Caddell served as consultants for the show from the beginning, helping writers and actors depict the West Wing accurately. Other former White House staffers, such as Peggy Noonan and Gene Sperling, have served as consultants for brief periods.

A documentary special in the third season compared the show's depiction of the West Wing to the real thing. Many former West Wing denizens applauded the show's depiction of the West Wing, including advisor David Gergen, Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove, and former Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton.

While critics often praised "The West Wing" for its writing, others faulted the show as unrealistically optimistic. A large part of this criticism came from the perceived naiveté of the characters. Television critic Heather Havrilesky asked "What rock did these morally pure creatures crawl out from under and, more important, how do you go from innocent millipede to White House staffer without becoming soiled or disillusioned by the dirty realities of politics along the way?"

Despite acclaim for the veracity of the series, Sorkin believed, "our responsibility is to captivate you for however long we've asked for your attention." Former White House aide Matthew Miller noted that Sorkin "captivates viewers by making the human side of politics more real than life — or at least more real than the picture we get from the news." Miller also noted that by portraying politicians with empathy, the show created a "subversive competitor" to the cynical views of politics in media. In the essay ""The West Wing" and the West Wing", author Myron Levine agreed, stating that the series "presents an essentially positive view of public service and a healthy corrective to anti-Washington stereotypes and public cynicism."

Dr. Staci L. Beavers, associate professor of political science at California State University, San Marcos, wrote a short essay, "The West Wing as a Pedagogical Tool", concerning the viability of "The West Wing" as a teaching tool. She concluded, "While the series’ purpose is for-profit entertainment, "The West Wing" presents great pedagogical potential." "The West Wing", in her opinion, gave greater depth to the political process usually espoused only in stilted talking points on shows like "Face the Nation" and "Meet the Press". However, the merits of a particular argument may be obscured by the viewer's opinion of the character. Beavers also noted that characters with opposing viewpoints were often set up to be "bad people" in the viewer's eyes. These characters were assigned undesirable characteristics having nothing to do with their political opinions, such as being romantically involved with a main character's love interest. In Beavers's opinion, a critical analysis of the show's political views can present a worthwhile learning experience to the viewer.

One of the stranger impacts of the show occurred on January 31, 2006, when "The West Wing" was said to have played a hand in defeating Tony Blair's government in the British House of Commons, during the so called ""West Wing" Plot". The plan was allegedly hatched after a Conservative Member of Parliament watched the episode, "A Good Day", in which Democrats block a bill aimed at limiting stem cell research, by hiding in an office until the Republican Speaker calls the vote.

"The West Wing" was sometimes called "The Left Wing" by detractors because of its portrayal of an ideal liberal administration and its alleged demonization of conservatives. Chris Lehmann, senior editor of Washington Post Bookworld, characterized the show as a revisionist look at the Clinton presidency: an attempt to solidify the Clinton legacy and to make America forget the Whitewater and Lewinsky scandals. On the other hand, some Republicans have admired the show since its inception, before even the departure of Sorkin and the show's resulting shift toward the center. In his 2001 article "Real Liberals versus the "West Wing"", Mackubin Thomas Owens wrote,
Journalist Matthew Miller wrote, "although the show indeed has a liberal bias on issues, it presents a truer, more human picture of the people behind the headlines than most of today's Washington journalists."

In its first season, "The West Wing" attracted critical attention in the television community with a record nine Emmy wins. The show has been praised for its high production values and repeatedly recognized for its cinematic achievements. With a budget of $6 million per episode, many consider each week's show to be a small feature film. However, many in the television community believe that the true genius of the show was Sorkin's rapid-fire and witty scripts.

"The West Wing" is noted for developing the "walk-and-talk"—long Steadicam tracking shots showing characters walking down hallways while involved in long conversations. In a typical "walk-and-talk" shot, the camera leads two characters down a hallway as they speak to each other. One of these characters generally breaks off and the remaining character is then joined by another character, who initiates another conversation as they continue walking. These "walk-and-talks" create a dynamic feel for what would otherwise be long expository dialogue, and have become a staple for dialogue-intensive television show scenes.

In its first year, "The West Wing" received nine Emmys, a record for most won by a series in a single season. The show also received the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003, tying "Hill Street Blues" and "L.A. Law" for most won in this category. Each of its seven seasons was nominated for the award. "The West Wing" ranks 8th all-time in number of Emmy Awards won by a show.

The show shares the Emmy Award record for most acting nominations by regular cast members for a single show in one year. (Both "Hill Street Blues" and "L.A. Law" also hold that record). For the 2001–2002 season nine cast members were nominated for Emmys. Allison Janney, John Spencer and Stockard Channing each won an Emmy (for Lead Actress, Supporting Actor and Supporting Actress). The others nominated were Martin Sheen (for Lead Actor), Richard Schiff, Dule Hill and Bradley Whitford (for Supporting Actor), and Janel Moloney and Mary-Louise Parker (for Supporting Actress). In that same year, Mark Harmon, Tim Matheson and Ron Silver were each nominated in the Guest Actor category (but none won the award). This gave the show an Emmy Award record for most acting nominations total (including guest performer category) in a single year, with 12 acting nominations.

Twenty Emmys were awarded to writers, actors, and crew members. Allison Janney is the record holder for most wins by a cast member, with a total of four Emmys.

In addition to its Emmys, the show won two Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards, in 2000 and 2001, for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. Martin Sheen is the only cast member to have won a Golden Globe, and he and Allison Janney are the only cast members to win a SAG award (for best actor and best actress). In both 1999 and 2000, "The West Wing" was awarded the Peabody Award for excellence in broadcasting.

This table shows award wins by cast members:

W.G. "Snuffy" Walden received an Emmy Award for Main Title Theme Music in 2000 for "The West Wing Opening Theme".

Many cast members have been Emmy-nominated for their work on "The West Wing" but have not won, including Martin Sheen—who was nominated each year for all seven seasons of the series without receiving the award—as well as Janel Moloney, who was nominated twice, and Dulé Hill, Rob Lowe, and Mary-Louise Parker, who were all nominated once. Matthew Perry, Oliver Platt, Ron Silver, Tim Matheson, and Mark Harmon have also received Emmy nominations for guest starring on the show.

"The West Wing" often features extensive discussion of current or recent political issues. After the real-world election of Republican President George W. Bush in 2000, many wondered whether the liberal show could retain its relevance and topicality. However, by exploring many of the same issues facing the Bush administration from a Democratic point of view, the show continued to appeal to a broad audience of both Democrats and Republicans.

In its second season episode "The Midterms", President Bartlet admonishes fictional radio host Dr. Jenna Jacobs for her views regarding homosexuality at a private gathering at the White House. Dr. Jacobs is a caricature of radio personality Dr. Laura Schlessinger, who strongly disapproves of homosexuality. Many of the president's biblical references in his comments to Dr. Jacobs appear to have come from an open letter to Dr. Schlessinger, circulated online in early May 2000.

The Bartlet administration experiences a scandal during the second and third seasons that has been compared to the Monica Lewinsky affair. President Bartlet was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) in 1992. The scandal centers around President Bartlet's nondisclosure of his illness to the electorate during the election. He is investigated by an opposition Congress for defrauding the public and eventually accepts Congressional censure. Multiple sclerosis advocacy groups have praised the show for its accurate portrayal of the symptoms of MS and stressing that it is not fatal. The National MS Society commented:

Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the start of the third season was postponed for a week, as were most American television premieres that year. A script for a special episode was quickly written and began filming on September 21. The episode "Isaac and Ishmael" aired on October 3 and addresses the sobering reality of terrorism in America and the wider world, albeit with no specific reference to September 11. While "Isaac and Ishmael" received mixed critical reviews, it illustrated the show's flexibility in addressing current events. The cast of the show state during the opening of the episode that it is not part of "The West Wing" continuity.

While the September 11 attacks do not occur in "The West Wing" continuity, the country does enter into a variation of the War on Terrorism. The war begins during the show's third season, when a plot to blow up the Golden Gate Bridge was uncovered; in response, the President orders the assassination of terrorist leader Abdul ibn Shareef. This storyline draws similarities to the real-world U.S. invasion of Afghanistan as well as U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia, as it brings the Middle East to the forefront of U.S. foreign relations and elevated terrorism as a serious threat in "The West Wing" universe. In Seasons 3, 4 and 5, the fictional Bahji terror group seems to act as a fictional stand-in for the real world Al Qaeda, but in Seasons 6 and 7, characters mention Al Qaeda itself as a threat, despite no clearly stated history of Al Qaeda terror attacks in "The West Wing" continuity (although Nancy McNally does refer to Osama Bin Laden as a potential threat at the beginning of Season 2.)

In the middle of the fourth season, Bartlet's White House is confronted with the genocide in the fictional African country of Equatorial Kundu which was compared to the Rwandan Genocide of 1994. The result was new foreign policy doctrine for Bartlet Administration and military intervention to stop the violence, which came after much hesitation and reluctance to call the conflict a genocide. In reality, the Clinton Administration didn't intervene in Rwanda, making series events look like a moral imperative.

In the sixth and seventh seasons, "The West Wing" explores a leak of top-secret information by a senior staffer at the White House. This leak has been compared to the events surrounding the Valerie Plame affair. In the storyline, the International Space Station is damaged and can no longer produce oxygen for the astronauts to breathe. With no other methods of rescue available, the president is reminded of the existence of a top-secret military space shuttle. Following the president's inaction, the shuttle story is leaked to a White House reporter, Greg Brock (analogous to Judith Miller), who prints the story in "The New York Times". Brock will not reveal his source and goes to jail for failing to do so, as did Miller. In order to stop the investigation, in which authorities suspect Chief of Staff C.J. Cregg, Toby Ziegler admits to leaking the information, and the President is forced to dismiss him. In comparison, the Plame affair resulted in the arrest and conviction of Lewis Libby, the vice president's chief of staff. However, Libby was convicted of perjury in testimony to a grand jury. No one was convicted for "blowing the cover" of Plame. (Richard Armitage, an official in the Bush State Department, acknowledged leaking information about Plame to reporters but was never charged with a crime.) Libby's two and a half year prison sentence was later commuted by President Bush, though the other facet of his sentence ($250,000 fine) stands until Libby's appeals were to be considered.

Other issues explored in "The West Wing" include:

All contemporary domestic government officials in "The West Wing" universe have been fictional. President Bartlet has made three appointments to the fictional Supreme Court and maintains a full cabinet, although the names and terms of all members have not been revealed. Some cabinet members, such as the Secretary of Defense, appear more often than others. Many other government officials, such as mayors, governors, judges, representatives, and senators, have been mentioned and seen as well.

Fictional locations inside the United States have been created to loosely represent certain places:

San Andreo is a fictional California city. It is located near San Diego, has a population of 42,000 and is the location of the San Andreo Nuclear Generating Station.

A near meltdown at the nuclear plant becomes the focus of an October surprise for Republican nominee Senator Arnold Vinick during the 2006 presidential election, due to Vinick's strong pro-nuclear stance and revelations of his active lobbying for the construction of the plant. This was seen to be a key factor in Vinick's narrow defeat in the election by Democratic nominee Congressman Matt Santos.

Hartsfield's Landing is a fictional town in New Hampshire. It is stated to be a very small community of only 63 people, of whom 42 are registered voters, that votes at one minute past midnight on the day of the New Hampshire primary, hours before the rest of the state, and has accurately predicted the winner of every presidential election since William Howard Taft in 1908. It is based on the true New Hampshire communities of Hart's Location and Dixville Notch, which in real life do vote before the rest of the state during the primaries, and also loosely upon the concept of "bellwether states" in US presidential elections.

Kennison State is a fictional university in Iowa that was used as the setting of a bombing in the beginning of the fourth season.

While several real-world leaders exist in the show's universe, most foreign countries have fictional rulers. Real people mentioned in "The West Wing" include Muammar al-Gaddafi, Yasser Arafat, Fidel Castro, Queen Elizabeth II, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, King Carl Gustaf, Thabo Mbeki and Osama bin Laden. However, when a peace accord was worked out between Israel and the Palestinian Authority at the start of the show's sixth season, the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority was the fictional Nizar Farad, not Arafat. (By that time in the real world, Arafat was dead and a successor, Rawhi Fattuh, had been elected.)

Entire countries are invented as composite pictures that epitomize many of the problems that plague real nations in certain areas of the world:

Qumar, a fictional oil-rich, terrorist-sponsoring Middle Eastern state, is repeatedly a source of trouble for the Bartlet administration. According to maps on the show, Qumar lies in southern Iran, directly across the important Strait of Hormuz. After the September 11 attacks, it became the main venue for the show's terrorism subplots.

Jabal Nafusah (also the name of a real-life Libyan city) seems to be the largest city and the capital, according to maps shown of the country. Qumar is an absolute monarchy, ruled by a sultan and his family. The country is a former British protectorate. The nation was first introduced in the third season where it was mentioned as a close ally of the United States. Qumar continues on the show to be a U.S. ally, though the sultan and other officials were extremely troubled by the Bartlet administration's assassination of Defense Minister Abdul ibn Shareef, and a bombing campaign and invasion that followed Zoey Bartlet's abduction by Qumari extremists (ostensibly in retaliation for Shareef's murder). As a result of the air strikes, gas pipelines were damaged, leading to economic troubles for the country and its European allies.

During the final season episode "The Cold", a situation room map shows the Persian Gulf clearly, but omits Qumar.

Equatorial Kundu is a fictional African nation blighted by AIDS and a civil war resembling the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

When Kundu was first mentioned in season 2, it is led by President Nimbala who is executed by the end of the episode. In January 2003 of the series' timeline ("Inauguration, Part I"), the Arkutu-run government of President Nzele (described as a "sadistic madman") begins an ethnic cleansing campaign against the Induye in Bitanga, killing 200 people. The violence soon spreads outside Bitanga and into the countryside. In President Josiah Bartlet's second inaugural address ("Inauguration Over There"), he announces the new Bartlet Doctrine for the use of force: America shall intervene whenever there are humanitarian interests at stake. With that new doctrine, Bartlet sends a brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne Division, and a Marine Expeditionary Unit, a force of 11,000 troops in total, to Kundu ("The California 47th"). As of the episode "Twenty Five," US forces are still operating in Kundu.

In its original appearance, Kundu's location is somewhat ambiguous. President Nimbala and his aide appear to speak Setswana, a Bantu language spoken in South Africa and Botswana, which would imply a Southern African setting. The Season 4 appearance seems to more firmly place the country in West Africa, near to the Ivory Coast and Ghana. Its capital city is Bitanga, which contains a major airport, TV station and a radio station.

In general, "The West Wing" attempts to create an alternative reality, in which there is a subtly different set of historical truths in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. In particular, the show tries to suggest that the last "real" president in its timeline is Richard Nixon, and to chart the careers of its principal players in the light of that decision. Nevertheless, there are occasions in which more contemporary presidents are implied.

Fictional Presidents who served between Nixon and Bartlet include one-term Democrat D. Wire Newman (James Cromwell) and two-term Republican Owen Lassiter.

Leo McGarry is mentioned as being Labor Secretary in the administration that was in office in 1993 and 1995. In the first season, an outgoing Supreme Court Justice tells President Bartlet that he had been wanting to retire for 5 years, but waited "for a Democrat." The season four episode "Debate Camp" features a flashback to the days just before Bartlet's inauguration, as Donna Moss meets with her Republican predecessor, Jeff Johnson, who makes it clear that the outgoing Republican administration has been in office for eight years. In season six Leo says that the Republicans have been "out of power for eight years", and Republicans at their convention say "eight (years) is enough".

The passage of time on the show relative to that of the real world is somewhat ambiguous when marked by events of shorter duration (e.g., votes, campaigns). Sorkin has noted in a DVD commentary track for the second season episode "18th and Potomac" that he has tried to avoid tying "The West Wing" to a specific period of time. Despite this, real years are occasionally mentioned, usually in the context of elections and President Bartlet's two-term administration.

The show's presidential elections are held in 2002 and 2006, which are the years of the midterm elections in reality. The election timeline in "The West Wing" matches up with that of the real world until early in the sixth season, when it appears that a year is lost. For example, the filing deadline for the New Hampshire primary, which would normally fall in January 2006, appears in an episode airing in January 2005.

In an interview, John Wells stated that the series began one and a half years into Bartlet's first term and that the election to replace Bartlet was being held at the correct time.

In the season 5 episode "Access", it is mentioned that the Casey Creek crisis occurred during Bartlet's first term, and network footage of the crisis carries the date of November 2001.

Bartlet's first campaign for president is never significantly explored in the series. Bartlet won the election with 48% of the popular vote, 48 million votes, and a 303–235 margin in the Electoral College. Bartlet faced three debates with his Republican opponent. It is mentioned that Bartlet won the third and final debate, which was held eight days before election day in St. Louis, Missouri, and that this helped swing a close election in his favor. Josh Lyman said in the days prior to the election "Bartlet was punching brick walls" as the result seemed too close to call, before the result broke his way. Leo McGarry said the same thing in "Bartlet for America" when he said "It was eight days to go, and we were too close to call".
The campaign for the Democratic nomination is extensively addressed. In the episodes "In the Shadow of Two Gunmen" and "Bartlet for America", flashbacks are used to tell how Bartlet defeated Texas Senator John Hoynes (Tim Matheson) and Washington Senator William Wiley for the Democratic nomination. The flashbacks also reveal how Leo McGarry persuaded Bartlet, who was then governor of New Hampshire, to run for president and how Bartlet ultimately selected John Hoynes as his choice as running mate.

"The West Wing"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 2002 presidential election pits Bartlet and Vice President John Hoynes against Florida Governor Robert Ritchie (James Brolin) and his running mate, Jeff Heston. Bartlet faces no known opposition for renomination, though Democratic Senator Stackhouse does launch a brief independent campaign for the presidency. Ritchie, not originally expected to contend for the nomination, emerges from a field of seven other Republican candidates by appealing to the party's conservative base with simple, "homey" sound bites.

Bartlet's staff contemplates replacing Vice President John Hoynes on the ticket with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Percy Fitzwallace (John Amos), among others. After it is clear that Ritchie will be the Republican nominee, Bartlet dismisses the idea, declaring that he wants Hoynes in the number two spot because of "four words," which he writes down and hands to his staffers to read: "Because I could die."

Throughout the season it is anticipated that the race will be close, but a stellar performance by Bartlet in the sole debate between the candidates helps give Bartlet a landslide victory in both the popular and electoral vote.

A speed-up in "The West Wing"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s timeline, in part due to the expiration of many cast members' contracts and a desire to continue the program with lower production costs, resulted in the omission of the 2004 midterm elections and an election during the seventh season. The sixth season extensively details the Democratic and Republican primaries. The seventh season covers the lead-up to the general election, the election, and the transition to a new administration. The timeline slows down to concentrate on the general election race. The election, normally held in November, takes place across two episodes originally broadcast on April 2 and April 9, 2006.

Congressman Matt Santos (D-TX) (Jimmy Smits) is nominated on the fourth ballot at the Democratic National Convention, during the sixth season finale. Santos was planning to leave Congress before being recruited to run for the presidency by Josh Lyman. Santos polled in the low single digits in the Iowa caucus and was virtually out of the running in the New Hampshire primary before a last-ditch direct television appeal vaults him to a third-place finish with 19% of the vote. Josh Lyman, Santos's campaign manager, convinces Leo McGarry to become Santos' running mate.

Senator Arnold Vinick (R-CA) (Alan Alda) secures the Republican nomination, defeating Glen Allen Walken (John Goodman) and the Reverend Don Butler (Don S. Davis), among others. Initially, Vinick wants Butler to become his running mate. However, Butler does not want to be considered because of Vinick's stance on abortion. Instead, West Virginia Governor Ray Sullivan (Brett Cullen) is chosen as Vinick's running mate. Vinick is portrayed throughout the sixth season as virtually unbeatable because of his popularity in California, a typically Democratic state, his moderate views, and his wide crossover appeal. Vinick, however, faces difficulty with the pro-life members of his party as a pro-choice candidate, and criticism for his support of nuclear power following a serious accident at a Californian nuclear power station.

On the evening of the election, Leo McGarry suffers a massive heart attack and is pronounced dead at the hospital, with the polls still open on the West Coast. The Santos campaign releases the information immediately, while Arnold Vinick refuses to use Leo's death as a "stepstool" to the presidency. Santos emerges as the winner in his home state of Texas, while Vinick wins his home state of California. The election comes down to Nevada, where both candidates need a victory to secure the presidency. Vinick tells his staff repeatedly that he will not allow his campaign to demand a recount of the votes if Santos is declared the winner. Josh Lyman is seen giving Santos the same advice, although the Santos campaign does send a team of lawyers down to Nevada. Santos is pronounced the winner of the election, having won Nevada by 30,000 votes, with an electoral margin of 272–266.

Santos organizes his administration, choosing Josh Lyman as Chief of Staff, who in turn calls on former colleague Sam Seaborn to be Deputy Chief of Staff. In need of experienced cabinet members, Santos taps Arnold Vinick as Secretary of State, believing the senior statesman to be one of the best strategists available and respected by foreign leaders.
President Bartlet's final act as President of the United States is pardoning Toby Ziegler. The series ends with Bartlet returning to New Hampshire. Having said his goodbyes to his closest staff, former President Bartlet tells President Santos, "Make me proud, Mr. President", to which Santos responds, "I'll do my best, Mr. President."

According to executive producer Lawrence O'Donnell, Jr., the writers originally intended for Vinick to win the election. However, the death of Spencer forced him and his colleagues to consider the emotional strain that would result from having Santos lose both his running mate and the election. It was eventually decided that the last episodes would be rescripted by John Wells. Other statements from John Wells, however, have contradicted O'Donnell's claims about a previously planned Vinick victory. The script showing Santos winning was written long before the death of John Spencer. In 2008 O'Donnell stated to camera "We actually planned at the outset for Jimmy Smits to win, that was our .. just .. plan of how this was all going to work, but the Vinick character came on so strong in the show, and was so effective, it became a real contest ... and it became a real contest in the West Wing writer's room."

Similarities between the fictional 2006 election and the real-life 2008 U.S. presidential election have been noted in the media: young minority Democratic candidate (Matthew Santos on the show, Barack Obama in real life) has a gruelling but successful primary campaign against a more experienced candidate (Bob Russell on the show, Hillary Clinton in real life) and chooses an experienced Washington insider as his running mate (Leo McGarry on the show, Joe Biden in real life), whereas the Republican contest is determined early in the primary season with an aging maverick senator of a Western state being the nominee (Arnold Vinick on the show, John McCain in real life), defeating an ordained minister as the closest competitor (Reverend Butler on the show, Mike Huckabee in real life), and then selecting a socially conservative running mate from a small Republican state (West Virginia Governor Ray Sullivan on the show, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin in real life)..

Writer Eli Attie called David Axelrod to talk about Obama after Obama's 2004 Democratic National Convention speech and says that he "drew inspiration from [Obama] in drawing [the Santos] character," while actor Jimmy Smits says that Obama "was one of the people that I looked to draw upon." Writer and producer Lawrence O'Donnell says that he partly modeled Vinick after McCain. Obama's Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, is said to be the basis of the Josh Lyman character, who became Santos' Chief of Staff.

"Setpember 11 2009"

I have been using Simple Wikipedia off and on for the past 10 months. I have created a number of articles and I have interacted in a polite and respectful way with fellow editors. I would like to work on making Wikipedia a more user friendly place where new users are encouraged to contribute to this body of knowledge.

I think that many users can get discouraged from editing wikipedia by some well meaning, yet perhaps over-zealous editors, who may mean well, but consquently discourage people who can bring in different styles to Wikipedia. I think the majority of editors have lives outside of wikipedia, and should not be excluded from higher participation because they don't spend many hours editing. 

It is my observation from looking at votes, and many discussions that wikipedia can have a solid core of users who may be able to use wikipedia for 20 plus hours a week and can view users with less usage with suspicion, and as "outsiders"

I am surprised at the hostility/rudeness which can cause potential good editors to give up and leave. I would like to implement rules to avoid this kind of forum, and not discriminate against users who may have alot going on in their personal life and can not contribute to a high degree. "Quality over Quanity" Thank you for your time and consideration.

<doc id="198155" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=198155" title="Lichen">
Lichen

Lichens are a symbiosis of at least two quite different organisms. The partnership always involves a fungus, which lives with one or more partners which can do photosynthesis. The photobiont partner may be a green alga and/or a cyanobacterium. 

The algae or bacteria live inside the fungus, and exchange nutrients with it. The lichen is different in shape and mode of life from any of the partners. It is a distinct form of life. Botanists did not know this until about 1875.

Lichens pose a problem for biological classification, because the three types of organism concerned come from three different kingdoms. After long debate, lichen are now classified as fungi, under the genus and species of the host fungus. This allows specimens to be put into boxes and labelled. By having specific names, researchers know what they are working on: that is one of the basic functions of taxonomy. The system still has its problems. In those fungi which may associate either with an alga, or with a cyanobacterium, the resulting forms (called "photomorphs") may look quite different, yet are now referred to by the same name.

20% (one in five) of fungal species live in lichens. Lichen fungi belong to several different groups of fungi. Most common (over 40%) are Ascomycetes, which produce spores in a sac-shaped container, the "ascus". Only a few types of alga occur within lichens; these algae also have their own names. Algae may be sometimes the dominant partner in so-called 'jelly lichens', "Collema" and "Leptogium", but this is rare. More usually, the algae are the green alga "Trebouxia". Other species are the orange "Trentepohli", and the cyanobacterium "Nostoc".

Lichens can occur anywhere on land, and some can live in aquatic environments. The nearest rock, wall or roof probably has lichen on it. Often the lichen is mat-like, and clings to the surface. Some are like little bushes: see the photos. Lichens are famous for not needing a regular supply of water; their metabolism can go into suspension, and later revive. When growing on mineral surfaces, some lichens slowly break down the substrate, and extract tiny amounts of mineral nutrient. Fungi form the main part of the thallus (body), with the photobiont contributing 20% or less. The photobiont is usually on the inside of the thallus.

Lichen thalli may grow together and fuse, and this may happen between different species and genera. These are called 'mechanical hybrids', and may be seen when the two forms are differently coloured. 

Lichen do survive extreme conditions. They are found in some of the most extreme places on Earth – the frozen north, hot deserts, rocky coasts. They are common as epiphytes on leaves and branches in rain forests and temperate woods. They can live on bare rock, walls and gravestones, and on exposed soil surfaces. There are about 200 different kinds of lichens in Antarctica. In the Horlick Mountains, at 86 degrees south, there are six different kinds of lichen. In the Himalayas, they grow at altitudes up to 18,000 feet (~5500m). 

The European Space Agency discovered that lichen can survive unprotected in space. Two species of lichen were sealed in a capsule and launched on a Russian Soyuz rocket. Once in orbit the capsules were opened. Two species of lichen were exposed to the vacuum of space, to cosmic radiation and huge swings of temperature. After 15 days the lichens were retrieved and were found to be in full health with no discernible damage.

There are a huge number of lichen species in rainforests, far outnumbering flowering plants. The lichen are mostly epiphytes, living on trees. A single site in Costa Rica yielded about 300 species of lichen on leaves, in the understory of the rain forest; a single fallen "Elaeocarpus" tree in New Guinea held 173 species; the evergreen laurel "Ocotea atirrensis" was found with 50–80 lichen species on a "single leaf".

When partnerships are very close, it is difficult to assign benefits to either partner. Their success is as a pair (or trio). Sometimes the partners can exist as separate organisms: certainly their close relatives can. Probably most of the algae and all of the cyanobacteria can survive, though in more restricted habitats. The details vary according to the specific species or strains involved. The man who first realised the nature of lichen, Simon Schwedener, thought of the partnership as one of controlled parasitism. Obviously, the photobiont provides photosynthetic products: carbohydrates as sugar alcohols (green algae) or glucose (cyanobacteria). The bacteria also convert atmospheric nitrogen (N) to ammonium ions (NH) which the fungus can use in amino acids for proteins. 

The alga certainly benefits from a supply of water (which the fungus is good at storing). There is also general mechanical protection. Algae get protection from ultraviolet light, which in some environments is quite significant. Probably, algae get access to the minute amounts of minerals, which the fungus gets from the substrate or from dust settling on the thallus. Algal cells are sometimes destroyed in the course of nutrient exchange, though the algal cells divide and replace them. Above all, the partnership is a resounding success, and gets to places where few other plants can survive.

Many lichens reproduce without sex (asexual reproduction). They make small groups of algal cells surrounded by fungal filaments. These "soridia" can be blown by wind. Some lichens just break up into fragments when they dry. Wind carries the pieces, which grow when moisture returns. Also, lichen fungi can reproduce sexually by forming fruiting bodies containing spores. These fruiting bodies are usually perennial, and may be long-lasing: some in the Swiss Alps have lived for over 50 years. After dispersal by wind, such fungal spores must meet with an algal partner to form a lichen.

The fossil record for lichen dates back 400 million year for certain, and the signs are that earlier forms existed 600 million years ago. They must have been one of the earliest life-forms on land. It is thought, from the number of fungal and algal species involved, that the symbiosis must have taken place many times between different species.

It has been suggested that some or all of the Ediacaran biota might be lichen. The proposal has been received with some skepticism.

Many lichen are sensitive to changes around them. For this reason, they are used by scientists to show changes in the environment, such as air pollution, ozone depletion, and metal contamination. Lichens have also been used to make dyes, perfumes, and herbal medicines.

Some lichen produce natural antibiotics that kill bacteria. Humans have used these compounds as natural antibiotics. Extracts from many "Usnea" species were used to treat wounds in Russia in the mid-twentieth century.

The map lichen "Rhizocarpon geographicum" grows extremely slowly, and can reach an age of over 1000 years. It may be used for dating: the diameter of the largest lichen of a species on a rock surface shows the time that the rock has been exposed.

Lichen are the main winter food for reindeer. The deer can get at shrubby lichen under the snow. In summer they have much more choice of food. Some lichen are edible by humans too. A kind of lichen, which is called "Iwatake" in Japanese and "Seogi" in Korean language, is collected from cliffs, and used in various Korean and Japanese foods. Lichen have a high level of acid. Care must be taken, as there are at least two kinds of lichen that are toxic.

The bacterial or algal partners produce pigments that absorb sunlight in photosynthesis. There are reports dating back almost 2000 years of purple and red colours being extracted from lichens. Lichens of the family Roccellaceae are commonly called orchella weed or orchil. They have been important in history, because they could supply Orcein, a dye. Today, dyes based on lichens have largely been replaced by synthetic ones. The pH indicator litmus is a dye extracted from the lichen genus "Rocella tinctoria" by boiling.

History of the Earth

The history of the Earth describes the most important events and fundamental stages in the development of the planet Earth from its formation to the present day. 

The age of the Earth is about 4.56 billion years. Nearly all branches of science have helped us understand the main events of the Earth's past. The Earth is about one third the age of the universe.

The formation of Earth occurred as part of the formation of the Solar System. It started as a large rotating cloud of dust and gas. This cloud, the solar nebula, was composed of hydrogen and helium produced in the Big Bang, as well as heavier elements produced in supernovas. Then, about 4.68×10 years ago, the solar nebula began to contract, rotate and gain angular momentum. This may have been triggered by a star in the region exploding as a supernova, and sending a shock wave through the solar nebula. 

As the cloud rotated, it became a flat disc perpendicular to its axis of rotation. Most of the mass concentrated in the middle and began to heat up. Meanwhile, the rest of the disc began to break up into rings, with gravity causing matter to condense around dust particles. Small fragments collided to become larger fragments, including one collection about 150 million kilometers from the center: this would become the Earth. As the Sun condensed and heated, nuclear fusion started, and the solar wind cleared out most of the material in the disc, which had not yet condensed, into larger bodies.


The Earth's relatively large natural satellite, the Moon, is unique. During the Apollo program, rocks from the Moon's surface were brought to Earth. Radiometric dating of these rocks has shown the Moon to be 4527 ± 10 million years old, about 30 to 55 million years younger than other bodies in the solar system. New evidence suggests the Moon formed even later, 4.48±0.02 Ga, or 70–110 Ma after the start of the Solar System. Another notable feature is the relatively low density of the Moon, which must mean it does not have a large metallic core, like all other terrestrial bodies in the solar system. The Moon has a bulk composition closely resembling the Earth's mantle and crust together, without the Earth's core. This has led to the giant impact hypothesis: the idea that the Moon was formed during a giant impact of the proto-Earth with another protoplanet.

The impactor, sometimes named Theia, is thought to have been a little smaller than the current planet Mars. Theia finally collided with Earth about 4.533 Ga.
Models reveal that when an impactor this size struck the proto-Earth at a low angle and relatively low speed (8–20 km/sec), much material from the mantles (and proto-crusts) of the proto-Earth and the impactor was ejected into space, where much of it stayed in orbit around the Earth. This material would eventually form the Moon. However, the metallic cores of the impactor would have sunk through the Earth's mantle to fuse with the Earth's core, depleting the Moon of metallic material. The giant impact hypothesis thus explains the Moon's abnormal composition. The ejecta in orbit around the Earth could have condensed into a single body within a couple of weeks. Under the influence of its own gravity, the ejected material became a more spherical body: the Moon.

The radiometric ages show the Earth existed already for at least 10 million years before the impact, enough time to allow for differentiation of the Earth's primitive mantle and core. Then, when the impact occurred, only material from the mantle was ejected, leaving the Earth's core of heavy elements untouched.

The impact had some important consequences for the young Earth. It released a enormous amount of energy, causing both the Earth and Moon to be completely molten. Immediately after the impact, the Earth's mantle was vigorously convecting, the surface was a large magma ocean. The planet's first atmosphere must have been completely blown away by the enormous amount of energy released. The impact is also thought to have changed Earth’s axis to produce the large 23.5° axial tilt that is responsible for Earth’s seasons (a simple, ideal model of the planets’ origins would have axial tilts of 0° with no recognizable seasons). It may also have sped up Earth’s rotation.

At the beginning of the Archean, the Earth's heat flow was nearly three times higher than it is today, and was still twice the current level by the beginning of the Proterozoic. Thus, tectonic and volcanic activity were considerably more active than they are today; the Earth's crust was not only thinner than is today, but probably broken up into many more tectonic plates, with numerous hot spots, rift valleys, and transform faults. The existence of plate tectonics in this eon is disputed: it is an active area of modern research.

There were no large continents until late in the Archean; small protocontinents were the norm, prevented from coalescing into larger units by the high rate of geologic activity. These felsic protocontinents probably formed at hot spots rather than subduction zones, from a variety of sources: mafic magma melting more felsic rocks, partial melting of mafic rock, and from the metamorphic alteration of felsic sedimentary rocks. 

The Archean atmosphere apparently lacked free oxygen. Temperatures appear to have been near modern levels, although astronomers think that the sun was about one-third dimmer. This is thought to reflect larger amounts of greenhouse gases than later in Earth history.

The oldest rock formations exposed on the surface of the Earth are Archean or slightly older. Archean rocks are known from Greenland, the Canadian Shield, western Australia, and southern Africa. Although the first continents formed during this eon, rock this age makes up only 7% of the world's current cratons; even allowing for erosion and destruction of past formations, evidence suggests that only 5-40% of the present continental crust formed during the Archean.

In contrast to the Proterozoic, Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments, such as greywackes, mudstones, volcanic sediments, and banded iron formations. Greenstone belts are typical Archean formations, consisting of alternating high and low-grade metamorphic rocks. The high-grade rocks were derived from volcanic island arcs, while the low-grade metamorphic rocks represent deep-sea sediments eroded from from the neighboring island arcs and deposited in a forearc basin. In short, greenstone belts represent sutured protocontinents.

Fossils of cyanobacterial mats (stromatolites) are found throughout the Archean—becoming especially common late in the eon—while a few other probable bacterial fossils are known from chert beds. In addition to bacteria, microfossils of the extremophilic archaea have also been identified. 

There are no known eukaryote fossils. No fossil evidence yet exists for viruses.

The geologic record of the Proterozoic is much better than that for the preceding Archean. In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean, the Proterozoic features many strata that were laid down in extensive, shallow epicontinental seas; furthermore, many of these rocks are less metamorphosed than Archean-age ones, and plenty are in fact unaltered. Study of these rocks show that the eon featured rapid continental accretion (unique to the Proterozoic), supercontinent cycles, and wholly-modern orogenic activity.

The first known glaciations occurred during the Proterozoic. One ice age began shortly after the beginning of the eon. There were at least four during the Neoproterozoic, climaxing with the "Snowball Earth" of the Varangian glaciation.

One of the most important events of the Proterozoic was the accumulation of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere. Though oxygen was undoubtedly released by photosynthesis well back in Archean times, it could not build up to any significant degree until chemical sinks--unoxidized sulfur and iron--had been filled; until roughly 2.3 billion years ago, oxygen was probably only 1 to 2% of its current level.(Stanley, 323) Banded iron formations, which provide most of the world's iron ore, were also a prominent chemical sink; most accumulation ceased after 1.9 billion years ago, either due to an increase in oxygen or a more thorough mixing of the oceanic water column.

Red beds, which are coloured by haematite, indicate an increase in atmospheric oxygen after 2 billion years ago; they are not found in older rocks.(Stanley, 324) The oxygen build-up was probably due to two factors: a filling of the chemical sinks, and an increase in carbon burial, which stored organic compounds which would have otherwise been oxidized by the atmosphere.

The first advanced single-celled and multi-cellular life roughly coincides with the oxygen accumulation; this may have been due to an increase in the oxidized nitrates that eukaryotes use, as opposed to cyanobacteria.(Stanley, 325) It was also during the Proterozoic that the first symbiotic relationship between mitochondria (for animals and protists) and chloroplasts (for plants) and their hosts evolved.

Eukaryotes such as acritarchs blossomed, as did cyanobacteria; in fact, stromatolites reached their greatest abundance and diversity during the Proterozoic, peaking roughly 1.2 billion years ago.

Classically, the boundary between the Proterozoic and the Paleozoic was set at the base of the Cambrian period when the first fossils of animals known as trilobites appeared. In the second half of the 20th century, a number of fossil forms have been found in Proterozoic rocks, but the boundary of the Proterozoic has remained fixed at the base of the Cambrian -- currently placed at 542 Ma.

The Paleozoic covers the time from the first appearance of abundant, hard-shelled fossils to the time when the continents were beginning to be dominated by large, relatively sophisticated reptiles and relatively modern plants. 

The upper (youngest) boundary is set at a major extinction event 250 million years later, known as the Permian–Triassic extinction event. Modern practice sets the older boundary at the first appearance of a distinctive trace fossil called "Phycodes pedum".

Geologically, the Paleozoic starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called Rodinia and at the end of a global ice age (Snowball Earth). Throughout the early Palaeozoic, the Earth's landmass was broken up into a substantial number of relatively small continents. Toward the end of the era, the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called Pangaea, which included most of the Earth's land area.

At the start of the era, life was confined to bacteria, algae, sponges and a variety of somewhat enigmatic forms known collectively as the Ediacaran fauna. A large number of body plans appeared nearly simultaneously at the start of the era—a phenomenon known as the Cambrian Explosion. 

There is some evidence that simple life may already have invaded the land at the start of the Palaeozoic, but substantial plants and animals did not take to the land until the Silurian and did not thrive until the Devonian. Although primitive vertebrates are known near the start of the Palaeozoic, animal forms were dominated by invertebrates until the mid-Palaeozoic. Fish populations exploded in the Devonian. During the late Palaeozoic, great forests of primitive plants thrived on land forming the great coal beds of Europe and eastern North America. By the end of the era, the first large, sophisticated reptiles and the first modern plants (conifers) had developed.

The Mesozoic covers the time when life was dominated by large sophisticated reptiles. The lower (oldest) boundary is set by the P/Tr extinction event. The upper (youngest) boundary is set at the K/T extinction event.

Geologically, the Mesozoic starts with almost all the Earth's land collected into a supercontinent called Pangaea. During the era, Pangaea split into the northern continent Laurasia and the southern continent Gondwana. Laurasia then split into North America and Eurasia. Gondwana broke up progressively into continents: South America, Africa, Madagascar, India, Australia and Antarctica.

The Mesozoic is known as the Age of Dinosaurs. It also saw the development of early birds and mammals, and of flowering plants (angiosperms). At the end of the Mesozoic, all the major body plans of modern life were in place although in some cases—notably the mammals—the forms that existed at the end of the Cretaceous were relatively primitive.

The Cainozoic is the age of mammals. During the Cainozoic, mammals diverged from a few small, simple, generalized forms into a diverse collection of terrestrial, marine, and flying animals. Flowering plants and birds also evolved substantially in the Cainozoic. 

Geologically, the Cainozoic is the era when continents moved into their current positions. Africa and Australasia split from Gondwana to drift north, and India collided with Southeast Asia; Antarctica moved into its current position over the South Pole; the Atlantic Ocean widened and, late in the era, South America became attached to North America.

Hello all. I’m here today to nominate for adminship. He is a very helpful user here on simple and tries to help in all areas. He has written two and helped to promote one . Pmlinediter is very active on and nominated several articles successful. During the last five months he made aprox. 3,500 edits and requested about 250 QDs. I fell, that we need new admins, because some good admins retired. The work doesn’t get less. I think Pmlinediter would be a good choice and also a good help for our team. He’s also an admin on SEWQ. I think he can be trusted with the tools. Good luck. () 10:58, 5 September 2009 (UTC)

"Candidate's acceptance:" I accept this nomination. Thank you Barras for having the trust in me to nominate me. I hope that I can become an admin and help the community. Thank you for your consideration.    11:01, 5 September 2009 (UTC)

Optional from ():

Q: Optional in the way of, I won't hold it against you if you don't answer. Here is are my questions... As far as blocking, how tolerant are you for mistakes... and are you apt to giving chances to editors? For example... if an editor who is indef blocked for vandalism and generic disruption comes back 4 months later, requesting unblock, admitting the misdeeds and promising not to recur, would you consider unblocking? Alternatively, for demonstrated immaturity disruptive to the project, how much tolerance for that?

A: It is very probable that I'll take this to for a community discussion. If the user had been blocked for immaturity/sockpuppetry/long term vandalizing, I wouldn't take the decision on my own.    08:31, 12 September 2009 (UTC)
Q: With regards to protecting pages... How do you decide to protect a page? In what circumstance, if any, would you find it acceptable to protect a page you are involved with?
A: Well, it generally depends on a case-by-case basis. I'd always prefer a before protecting a page I'm involved with. However, if the page is being vandalized for a long time, then I'd probably protect it and will post a thread at AN. Of course, before protecting, I'd check .    08:31, 12 September 2009 (UTC)

Q: Do you "have" to provide administrator assistance to all who asks? When would it be ok, if ok at all, to tell an editor ""No, I won't be able to help, try the list of admins, of the administrators' noticeboard""?
A: Generally yes, but it depends. You can't possibly feed the trolls, neither can you restore a page deleted after an RfD. It is in such situations that I'll take it to AN. In general, yes, it is always best to provide administrative assistance.    08:31, 12 September 2009 (UTC)

Harrow School

Harrow School, often called simply "Harrow", is a school for boys in Harrow in the historic County of Middlesex in England. Harrow has educated boys since 1243 but was officially founded by John Lyon under a Royal Charter of Elizabeth I in 1572. Harrow is located in Harrow on the Hill, now in the London Borough of Harrow. The school has about 800 students. They live across twelve boarding houses, and all of them board full time.

Harrow is an independent fee-paying school, of the type known in Britain as "public schools". The equivalent term in the US would probably be "private schools" (see discussion at public school). The annual fees at Harrow are at present £28,545 per year, which includes board, tuition and textbooks. 

The Harrow Foundation also runs an independent Grammar School in Harrow, called the John Lyon School, and several international schools. The John Lyon School is also fee-paying and academically selective.

Ja, vi elsker dette landet

"Ja, vi elsker dette landet", in English, "Yes, we love this country" is the Norwegian national anthem. 

It is commonly referred to as only "Ja, vi elsker", "Yes, we love". The lyrics were written by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, and melody by his cousin, Rikard Nordraak.

The first verse goes like this:
""Ja, vi elsker dette landet,"
"som det stiger frem,"
"furet, værbitt over vannet,"
"med de tusen hjem,"
"elsker, elsker det og tenker,"
"på vår far og mor,"
"på den saganatt som senker, "
"drømmer på vår jord,"
"på den saganatt som senker,"
"senker drømmer på vår jord.""
Roughly translated to English:
""Yes, we love this country,"
"as it rises forth,"
"wrinkled, weather-beaten over the water,"
"with the thousand homes,"

Mass number

Atoms are made up of one or more small mass particles called "Nucleons". However, the weight of an atom is not just a simple multiple number equal to the number of nucleons, but rather a number related to the number of nucleons plus a second quantity (or amount) related to the numerical value of the amount of free energy that the free neutron kept after it dropped into the energy sink made by the gradual build up of the atom's other nucleons. And, since we are using the value of 12 for the mass of an atom of 6C12 (Carbon), and since that number also has an amount of remaining free energy, The mass number of the atoms of the other elements varies around the nucleon number and can be more or less than that value.

Atomic mass numbers are important values used to measure the relative stability and capability of atomic change of atoms in nuclear physics considerations. The CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics lists these numbers as do other publications.
The mass number is also the amount of protons and neutrons added together.

LazyTown

LazyTown is a television programme aimed at young children from Iceland. The show is educational and teaches children to be healthy and exercise. The programme was created by people from Iceland, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.

The show has been very successful, and has aired in many countries around the world, and dubbed into many languages. The show ran from 2004 to 2007, but the United Kingdom has continued the series with "LazyTown Extra", a spin-off of "LazyTown".

The show features live-action actors and puppet characters set in a colourful town called LazyTown. At the start of the show, the town's citizens are very lazy, but the mayor's niece Stephanie arrives to change that. She is aided by an athletic superhero named Sportacus, who teaches the children of the town to eat healthy food and exercise each day. However, their fun is often stopped by the town's laziest man, Robbie Rotten, who spends large amounts of time attempting to make the children lazy again and trying to remove Sportacus and Stephanie from the town, usually by dressing up in disguises to fool the children. Robbie's plans often fail. The show's episodes often involve an educational or important message for viewers, and songs or dance numbers performed by the characters, usually Stephanie being the lead singer or dancer.

<doc id="198289" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=198289" title="Waltzing Matilda">
Waltzing Matilda

"Waltzing Matilda" is one of Australia's best known songs. The bush ballad, a country folk song, has been called "the unofficial national anthem of Australia".
The title, Waltzing Matilda, is Australian slang for walking through the country looking for work, with one's goods in a "Matilda" (bag) carried over one's back.

The song tells the story of a traveling farm worker making a drink of tea at a bush camp and capturing a sheep to eat. When the sheep's owner arrives with three policemen to arrest the worker for taking the sheep (a crime punishable by hanging), the worker drowns himself in a small watering hole. The worker's ghost stays to haunt the site.

The words to the song were written in 1895 by a poet and nationalist Banjo Paterson. It was first printed as sheet music in 1903. There are many stories about the song and how it was written. The song has its own museum, the Waltzing Matilda Centre in Winton, Queensland.

The music, based on a folk song, was written by Christina Macpherson. Paterson wrote the words while staying at the Dagworth Homestead, farm in Queensland. While he was there the owners played him an old Celtic folk tune called "The Craigeelee". Paterson decided that it would be a good tune to write words for and completed during his stay at the farm.

The tune is probably the Scottish song "Thou Bonnie Wood Of Craigielea", which Macpherson heard played by a band at the Warrnambool steeplechase. Robert Tannahill wrote the words in 1805 and James Barr wrote the music in 1818. In 1893 it was arranged for brass band by Thomas Bulch. The tune may have been based on the melody of "Go to the Devil and Shake Yourself", written by John Field (1782–1837) sometime before 1812. It is sometimes also called: "When Sick Is It Tea You Want?" (London 1798) or "The Penniless Traveller" (O'Neill's 1850 collection).

There is also an idea that tune may be similar to "The Bold Fusilier" (also called "Marching through Rochester"), a song sung to the same tune and dated by some back to the eighteenth century but first printed in 1900.

<poem>A bold fusilier came marching back through Rochester
Off from the wars in the north country,
And he sang as he marched
Through the crowded streets of Rochester,
Who'll be a soldier for Marlboro and me?</poem>

There are no "official" words to "Waltzing Matilda", and slight differences can be found in the sources. This version uses the famous "You'll never catch me alive said he" variation introduced by the Billy Tea company. Paterson's original words use 'drowning', which the tea company felt was too negative.

<poem>
Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong
Under the shade of a coolibah tree,
And he sang as he watched and waited 'til his billy boiled
"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me"

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me"
And he sang as he watched and waited 'til his billy boiled,
"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me".

Down came a jumbuck to drink at that billabong, 
Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee, 
And he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tucker bag, 
"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me". 

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me"
And he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tucker bag,
"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me".

Up rode the squatter, mounted on his thoroughbred,
Down came the troopers, one, two, three,
"Where's that jolly jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?"
"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me".

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me"
"Where's that jolly jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?",
"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me".

Up jumped the swagman and sprang into the billabong,
"You'll never catch me alive", said he,
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong,
"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me".

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me"
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong,
"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me." 
"Oh, You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me."

Wolfgang Paul

Wolfgang Paul (born in Lorenzkirch, Germany 1913 - Bonn 1993) was a German professor awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1989.

Paul was born on August 10 of 1913 in the German city of Lorenzkirch, Saxony. When he was young, his family moved to Munich, where his father taught pharmaceutical chemistry at the University of Munich. In 1932, he began his studies of physics at the Superior School in Munich, and soon moved to the 1934 at the headquarters of Berlin, getting his doctorate in 1939.

In 1944, he began his teaching at the University of Göttingen and 1952 was hired at the University of Bonn as director of its Institute of Experimental Physics, a position he kept until his death.

Wolfgang Paul died December 7 of 1993 at his residence in Bonn.

During WWII he investigated the separation of isotopes, which is necessary to produce material to make nuclear fission for use in nuclear weapons.

He started his research into ions, developing the so-called ion trap. 

For this discovery, in 1989 he was awarded half of the Nobel Prize in Physics, shared with Hans G. Dehmelt.

Between 1965 and 1967, he was appointed Director of the Division of Nuclear Physics at CERN.

Babe: Pig in the city is a 1998 sequel to the 1995 movie "Babe". It takes place in the fictional city of Metropolis. Because of the unexpected darker and more grown up subject matter (the movie includes a scene in which a dog almost drowns while hanging from a bridge), the movie was not received as well critically as the first "Babe" movie was, and reviews were generally mixed. However, it was also praised by some, and gained a cult following.

Robber

A robber is a person who steals or takes something belonging to someone else. Robbers always use force or threats to take what they want. A bank robber is someone who steals money from a bank. When the robber takes something, this is called a robbery. One famous robbery was the Great Train Robbery in England. The words "robbery under arms" means that the robber used weapons such as a gun in the robbery. Many robbers have become famous, such as Jesse James in America, or Ben Hall in Australia. Australian robbers were called bushrangers.

The word "rob" comes from a Latin word, "deraubare". This word came from a German word "raub" which means clothes. Before clothes were made in factories and became cheap, robbers often took a persons clothes.

I think this article merits inclusion. I was the last to do a big edit on it, and that was months ago. () 20:23, 13 August 2009 (UTC)

For those of you who tuned in late, here's what has happened: The thing was up for vote, but then thought it would benefit from more time here, so it's back here again. Thoughts? Reviews? Shots in the back? () 00:18, 30 August 2009 (UTC)

Clerk Note: This article is now showing promise for GA status, so well done on fixing the concerns raised. However, it doesn't currently have consensus for promoting to GA and the time period is up. Now then, I don't particularly like the time periods, but I don't agree with indefinitely running nominations either. So, i'm at an end as to what to do with this. I'm moving towards a "close-and-re-list-in-a-week", but feel that that would probably be utterley pointless and just a waste of everyone's time. At a very quick glance it doesn't look "that" far off VGA, so another option would be "close-and-re-list-as-VGA". Final option that I see would be to extend the time limit (but then setting a precedent for all other noms) for a week or so. But as I say, it would precendent-set. I know in the past the first option was used the most, so that would probably also be the fairest. I'm gonna think on it and come back later - please continue to comment, and/or close/decide for me. Ta. 17:51, 4 September 2009 (UTC) 

Closed as not promoted: As I mentioned above, this article is "so" close, and I really, really want to be writing "closed as promoted" here. But i'm afraid it's now a couple of days past the three week mark and a consensus just hasn't formed, so I would feel uncomfortable promoting it. My suggestion is to work on it some more as this article could become VGA material with little work, and then list it there sometime next week. Don't see it as a wasted effort (it most certainly is not!), just see it as a) unlucky and b) a chance to make it even better than it already is. Thanks for your time, and if anyone pops along and thinks a consensus "has" formed then feel free to promote. Regards, 18:14, 5 September 2009 (UTC) 

Don't be quick to judge me. I know it looks just like ENWP's version, however if you look closely I have simplified a chunk of the article. Basically, its directly copied and broken down into simpler english. — 12:24, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

This article would look pathetic at ENWP, but it meets the criteria for GAs in this wiki. — 15:30, 20 August 2009 (UTC)


I "discovered" this article a few days ago, and have since edited it heavily.It is currently about 18k in size, which should be enough to make a good article. The main problems I see so far is that referencing is currently non-existent, and that the EnWP article is similarly bad (in that respect). Parts of the article may also be hard to understand, simplifying here and there may be helpful. Anyway, I thought I'd list it. -- () 15:42, 6 September 2009 (UTC)


Failed GA nom, I'd like a review to take it to GA.    12:32, 24 August 2009 (UTC)




I'd like a review, I feel I can get it to GA. :-) 02:00, 24 August 2009 (UTC)



"End date: September 30, 23:14 UTC"<br>
Recent failed GA nomination. Most or all of the prior concerns are resolved. There had been talk of nomming it for VGA, but a straw poll said it should start back here first () 23:14, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

You never said that. Give specific examples and 'place them on the talk page so that other editors can place them there or explain why they're not there. If no specific examples are given, you argument has no weight. Also, remember that SimWP is not EnWP, or even a simplified version of it, and that quite a few GAs are way way shorter than other articles. () 04:45, 10 September 2009 (UTC) P.S.: By my check of the Biden EnWP article, all headings and the majority of paragraph subjects have found their way into this article


 () 18:08, 13 September 2009 (UTC)

1, 2, 3 and 4 have all been (though, with #2, it should be noted that you "run" for President even when seeking the nomination). 5 has not--it basically says Biden has some honorary doctorates. 6 gets to the point of contention Julian and I have had all week. I've taken the liberty of starting . Oh, and one more thing...what are the forked articles? There's probably more if you count that Beau and Robert have articles on enwp, but not here () 18:45, 13 September 2009 (UTC)
<Does anybody have any comments on this/suggestions for what this article needs? Nobody's commented on this for four days () 18:27, 19 September 2009 (UTC)

It's light. So he's VP of USA, but you need to expand his pre-VP career significantly. () 18:58, 26 September 2009 (UTC)

IMO, this article clearly meets all GA criteria
This article has also been reviewed, and the concerns have been fixed. It may not be anywhere near VGA, but it clearly meets GA. Thoughts? () 19:51, 26 September 2009 (UTC)

Re-nomming this as I feel it's now up to scratch. There's still a few things on the TP that i'm going to do now, but please add more and comment in general :). Regards, 18:38, 10 September 2009 (UTC) 


A former GA, demoted to regular status, I think I've adressed most of the issues and am giving this another shot. Another review could be good to find the remaining problems. 10:53, 12 September 2009 (UTC)
Seems to meet most criteria... () 09:54, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

Interesting article and full of references etc. Advice to ensure we agree it's a good article? () 18:43, 26 September 2009 (UTC)

I can't see any complaints here. This is a nicely illustrated, well referenced and comprehensive article. Congrats to Fuhghettaboutit for doing an A1 job on making a complex article simple enough for even me to understand. Great work. All the rest of us just tried to polish the edges. Great stuff. () 20:22, 21 October 2009 (UTC)

Seems to meet the criteria. Would like a review. 10:56, 1 October 2009 (UTC)

Excluding those references, is this long enough? Also, we need to stop overdoing the image thing, text should "not" be squashed between images, it looks awful. It's all very well to say "Deccan Charges" come from Hyderabad in the lead, but since it's redlinked, what on earth are they? Why is the language section under Geography? Place references after punctuation where possible. References should have titles, publishers or works and access dates as a minimum. Check your sources, are they all ? Screen India, thomex.com, world-gazetteer.com - they all need justification for use. () 09:59, 3 October 2009 (UTC)

I got tired of BG7's trains, so I'm proposing a nice road article to spice things up a bit. Joking aside, how does it look, aside from redlinks and broken templates? Just wanted to get a head start on this review. – |  01:15, 25 October 2009 (UTC)

Another little nugget. A touch of updating to be done but otherwise half-decent? () 16:06, 3 October 2009 (UTC)

This appears to be close to meeting the criteria. Any thoughts? () 16:20, 3 October 2009 (UTC)


Just found this, looks okay. Comprehensive, referenced, illustrated. () 15:51, 3 October 2009 (UTC)



Closed as not promoted: Although this article does meet the criteria, I feel that it is going to need "beefing up" a bit before it truly is a good article. I also think back to the recent incident about comprehensiveness in GA articles - we did not promote an article then and by promoting this one it would be unfair and a double standard. Sorry, but not now. 17:46, 3 November 2009 (UTC)

I understand your concerns and will change to promote. My decision was based on the fact "their wasn't much to the article". Anyway, "Erare Humanum est", thanks for commenting. 18:08, 3 November 2009 (UTC)

The article looks good to. It still has a few redlinks. Perhabs a spell/grammar check by an other editor would be useful. All comments are welcome. () 14:05, 3 November 2009 (UTC)

Despite the relative brevity of this article, it seems complete enough for GA. No major concerns on my end. – |  17:24, 10 November 2009 (UTC)

This is a good article I wrote at w:. I have worked hard to simplify it for here over the past week. What do you think guys?-- () 12:53, 2 November 2009 (UTC)

This is a featured article at enwiki. I simplified it offline before posting. This is certainly not one of the newer crop of featured articles and wouldn't meet the really exacting standards shot for now but a it's a [morbidly] fascinating subject. Comments welcome.-- ()
Not quite as well developed as the past few I've listed here which had all been granted good or featured status at enwiki before I simplified them, but it's a fully cited and structured article and I believe it meets in spades the tacit tenth criterion of fuzzy cuteness .-- () 05:26, 6 November 2009 (UTC)


Already failed a GA proposal once, for lack of votes. At first looks, article looks well-written, might need one or two refs though. I'll leave it up to the community...-- () 20:57, 14 November 2009 (UTC)
Closed as Not Promoted: Little work has been done on this since the nomination was made, and looking through it it is still not in GA shape. Sorry. 16:01, 8 December 2009 (UTC) 

Just got done creating this (content based on Enwiki's version). It has some redlinks and is likely to be rough 'round the edges but I think it has some potential. All thoughts are very much welcome. – |  02:22, 4 November 2009 (UTC)


Not bad at all. I'm in of this becoming a GA. 21:49, 3 December 2009 (UTC)

Nominated a while back but not promoted over it's length. Now that requirement has gone i'd like to re-submit this for consideration as a Good Article. 11:22, 22 November 2009 (UTC) 
Better - thanks! Just one more thing, I wouldn't mind the lead being a tad longer. – |  21:36, 27 November 2009 (UTC)






Closed as promoted. Looks as though it meets all criteria and has support from multiple editors. 22:27, 12 December 2009 (UTC)

Fitzgerald should have a good article. I hope with some tidying up this'll be ok. () 08:46, 18 November 2009 (UTC)

Been doing some work on this for a while. A pretty core article, I mean they are fundamentally important to the entire universe. I appreaciate it's not entirely comprehensive when compared to the En article but some parts of that were very complex, and I found it hard to translate the ideas into Simple English.
However, I still think it's pretty much up to Good Article standard. 21:40, 3 December 2009 (UTC)


I think it needs more references. The article is quite fine other than that. 05:49, 5 January 2010 (UTC)
Closed as not promoted: This article has been here for 3 weeks and I see hardly any effort to improve it. Thus, this is not promoted. Fix the issues and bring this article here again. Regards,   08:30, 21 January 2010 (UTC)

The 1965 Atlantic hurricane season was the first hurricane season to have the bounds from June 1, 1965 to November 30, 1965. The 1965 Atlantic hurricane season did not have very many storms. A famous hurricane from this season would be Hurricane Betsy. Hurricane Betsy was the first hurricane to cause a billion dollors or more in damage, without being changed to the value of the dollar today.


This is a list of all the names set aside for use in the 1965 Atlantic hurricane season. The names not used are in .
After the season Betsy and Carol were retired. Carol was retired not because of the 1965 storm but because of the 1954 storm. Blanche and Camille were used instead of Betsy and Carol in 1969.

The 1964 Atlantic hurricane season was the last hurricane season to last from June 15, 1964 to November 15, 1964. A tropical storm did form before June 15, however. This season was just short of normal. All hurricanes of the 1964 Atlantic hurricane season became major hurricanes (category 3+). Famous hurricanes from this season were: Hurricane Cleo, Dora, and Hilda.

The following names were used for named storms (tropical storms and hurricanes) that formed in the North Atlantic in 1964. A storm was named Isbell for the first time in 1964. Names that were not assigned are marked in .

After the season the names Cleo, Dora, and Hilda were retired. Candy, Dolly, and Hannah were used in 1968 instead of Cleo, Dora, and Hilda.

Federation of Australia

The federation of Australia was the way that the six separate British colonies of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia joined together to become one country. When the Constitution of Australia came into force, on 1 January 1901, the colonies became states of the Commonwealth of Australia.

People had been trying to get the colonies to join together in a federation of Australia during the 1850s and 1860s. In the 1890's a number of big meetings, called conventions, were held to write a constitution for Australia. Sir Henry Parkes, Premier of New South Wales, was the main person supporting this idea. Fiji and New Zealand were going to be part of it, but decided not to join the federation.

As soon as the Federation happened, Sir Edmund Barton was put in charge as Prime Minister of Australia until the first Australian elections were held. Barton won the election and continued to be the Prime Minister.

Royal Exhibition Building

The Royal Exhibiton Building is in Carlton, Victoria, Australia. When it was built in 1880, it was the largest building in Australia and the tallest building in Melbourne. It is listed as a World Heritage site. It is the only 19th century exhibition hall that held an international exhibition still in use. In 1880, 1.8 million people visited the exhibition; the population of Melbourne was only 282,000 people. From 1901 to 1925 the state government of Victoria used the building while the federal government used the State Parliament buildings.

In 2009, archaeologists dug up the car park to find out more about the buildings. They found paths from gardens that had been on the site before the building was put up. They also found the remains of an octagonal (eight-sided) kiosk which had sold food snacks and drinks in the gardens. They also found the remains of an extra building put up in 1888 to hold military weapons that were part of the 1880 exhibition.

Siege of Fort Zeelandia

The Siege of Fort Zeelandia is the name for Koxinga's Invasion of Taiwan. The siege started in 1661 and ended in 1662. It ended the Dutch East India Company's rule over Taiwan. After the siege, the Kingdom of Tungning ruled over the island. This event was said to be "a war that determined the fate of Taiwan in the four hundred years".
In 1659, after an unsuccessful attempt to capture Nanjing, Koxinga, leader of Ming loyalists began searching for a home for his men. 

"He Bin", who was working for the Dutch East India Company, fled to Koxinga's base in Xiamen and provided Koxinga with a map of Taiwan. The Dutch had established a post at Tayoan, that had two forts. The first was Fort Zeelandia at the entrance to the bay at Tayoan which was the main Dutch settlement. The second was Fort Provintia also located at the bay. Frederick Coyett, the governor of Taiwan was at Fort Zeelandia with 1,800 men. Fort Provintia had 500 men.

Koxinga's fleet set sail from Kinmen on March 23, 1661. His fleet consisted of hundreds of ships of various sizes, with 25,000 men aboard. The fleet arrived at Tayoan on April 2, and, after passing through a shallow waterway unknown to the Dutch, landed at Luermen.

The men laid siege to Fort Provintia and it surrendered on April 4. Three days after the capture of Fort Provintia, Koxinga's men surrounded Fort Zeelandia and demanded it's surrender. Koxinga sent a Dutch priest Anthonius Hambroek to ask for this surrender. Hambroek dis not do this and he was killed after returning to Koxinga's camp.

Koxinga's fleet then used cannons and they attempted to enter the fort, but many died. Koxinga then waited outside the fort. On May 28, news of Koxinga's attack reached Jakarta. The Dutch sent 10 ships and 700 sailors to help. The ships arrived on July 5 and had some small fights with Koxinga's fleet.

On July 23, the two sides fought as the Dutch ships tried to enter the fort. After a while, the Dutch ships had to retreat with two ships lost, three small vessels captured, and about a hundred casualties. The Dutch tried to break the siege again in October, but were beaten back by Koxinga's army. This victory, coupled with news of low morale among the garrison from deserted German mercenaries, convinced Koxinga to launched an assault in December.

On January 12, 1662, Koxinga's fleet began another bombardment, while the ground force prepare to assault the fort. With supplies dwindling and no sign of reinforcement, Coyett raised a white flag. The surrender was complete on February 1, and the Dutch East India Company left Taiwan on February 17.

Coyett was tried for surrendering and exiled to the Banda Islands. He was pardoned after help from his friends. He published a book named "Neglected Formosa" () in 1675. In the book he criticized the company for neglecting his pleas for reinforcement.

After the loss of Tayoan, the Dutch East India Company tried to recapture it. They joined with the Qing Empire to battle Koxinga's fleet, but failed.

The battle was shown in the movie "Zheng Chenggong 1661", which ends with Koxinga's victory over the Dutch. The movie's English title is "Sino-Dutch War 1661".

Cotuí

Cotuí is a Dominican city and the head municipality of the Sánchez Ramírez province, in the center of the country. 

"Cotuí" is the Taíno name of the region where the old city was founded. The present city is in the Cibao Valley, at about 105 km to the north of Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic.

The municipality had, in 2002, a total population of 74,056: 37,745 men and 36,311 women. The urban population was 56.87% of the total population. In this numbers are included the population of the municipal districts that are part the municipality.

Cotuí is located north of the Sierra de Yamasá mountain range, in the Cibao Valley. The city is near the River Yuna, one of the most important river of the Hispaniola island.

The municipality has a total area of 619.88 km². There are four municipal districts (administrative subdivisions of a municipality) in Cotuí; these are:

The town was founded in 1505 by Rodrigo Mejía de Trujillo, a Spanish conquistador; the Spanish governor of the Hispaniola island at that time was Nicolás de Ovando. It was built near a gold mine in a region called "Cotoi" (also written "Cotoy") by the Taíno people.

The old town was near the present town of Maimón and there were important improvements in the town during those first years and its named was changed to "La Mejorada Villa de Cotuí" (in English: "The Improved City of Cotuí") but most people called it "Los Mineros" (in English: "The Miners").
In 1562 there was a strong earthquake that destroyed the town and other cities in the island. Cotuí was moved to its present place in 1569, close to the river Yuna.

It was made a municipality in 1822 by the Haitian government and it was one of the first municipalities of the country after the Dominican Independence in 1844. In 1952, Cotuí was made the head municipality of the new province of Sánchez Ramírez.

Farming is very important around the city; some important products are rice, cacao, orange and pineapple. Cattle raising is also an important activity in the municipality.

Mining is also important here; gold and silver are mined close to the old, colonial mines.

Costume

The word costume is used to describe a set of clothes that someone is wearing in order to say something about their personality. Some costumes are special to particular countries or areas. These are called “National Costumes”. They are worn because people are proud of their country. Actors in a theatre wear costumes because they are pretending to be a particular person in a play or ballet. Costumes can be worn for carnivals or parties. These are often called “Fancy Dress”.

National costume or regional costume is worn to show that the people come from a particular country or area. Many years ago, national costume was worn every day by many groups of people. Today there are not many areas where national costume is worn daily. Usually people dress up in national costume for special celebrations or for national dancing.

Some well known examples of national costume are the kilt which is worn by people in Scotland, and the kimono worn in Japan.

When actors perform in the theatre they always wear a costume. These are the special clothes they wear in order to pretend they are a particular character in the story which they act out. They might be pretending to be any kind of person: a beggar, king, a businessman, an ancient god etc. Some theatrical costumes are very “stylized”. That means they exaggerate some aspects of the character. Examples are Harlequin and Pantaloon in the Commedia dell'arte.
Costumes are worn at festivals such as Mardi Gras and Halloween. They are used for fancy dress parties. People who dress up in fancy dress may be pretending to be a character from a fairy tale or a film. They may be ghosts, or vampires, or perhaps an Easter Bunny for Easter, or an Uncle Sam costume worn on the Independence day.

Children enjoy wearing costumes and pretending to be particular people or animals.

Great hurricane of 1780

The Great Hurricane of 1780 was the Atlantic hurricane ever recorded. It killed more than 27,500 people when it passed through the Caribbean. There is not much known about the storm, because it happened before people took official records of hurricanes.

The hurricane hit Barbados with winds possibly over 200 mph (320 km/h). It then moved past Martinique, Saint Lucia, and Saint Eustatius. Thousands of deaths were reported on each island. In the middle of the American Revolution, the storm caused heavy losses to British and French fleets. 

The hurricane later passed near Puerto Rico and tracked over the eastern portion of the Dominican Republic. It eventually turned to the northeast, and was last seen on October 20 to the southeast of Newfoundland.

The hurricane was part of the very bad 1780 Atlantic hurricane season, with two other deadly storms during the same month. The Great Hurricane killed more then twice as many people as Hurricane Mitch did (Hurricane Mitch was the second deadliest hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean).

The municipality had, in 2002, a total population of 63,684: 33,756 men and 29,928 women. The urban population was 35.31% of the total population. In this numbers are included the population of the municipal districts that are part the municipality. The population of El Seibo without its municipal district was 50,432.

The municipality has a total area of 1,344.33 km². There are three municipal districts (administrative subdivisions of a municipality) in El Seibo; these are:

El Seibo is near, on the south side, the "Cordillera Oriental" (in English: "Eastern mountain range". It is located in the northeastern part of the "Llano Costero del Caribe" (in English, "Caribbean Coastal Plain"), a large prairie with many important savannas.

The city is near the River Soco, one of the most important river of the eastern region of the Hispaniola island.

El Seibo is at an elevation of 117 m with an average temperature in the city of 26.7 °C and the average rainfall of 1,307.7 mm.

The municipality of El Seibo has the municipality of the Miches to the north, the La Altagracia province to the east, the La Romana province to the southeast, the San Pedro de Macorís province to the southwest and the Hato Mayor province to the west.

The town was founded on 1502 by Juan de Esquivel, a Spanish conquistador; the Spanish governor of the Hispaniola at that time was Nicolás de Ovando. The original name of the town was "Santa Cruz de Icayagua", also written as Hicayagua.

Cattle raising is the most important activity in the municipality. Sugar cane is also grown here.

Juan de Esquivel

Juan de Esquivel (about 1480 - about 1513) was a Spanish soldier and colonial administrator (a "Conquistador"). He conquered and governed the island of Jamaica for Spain.

He was born in Seville, Spain, about 1480. He came with Nicolás de Ovando to America, to the Hispaniola island, in 1502. In 1503, Ovando sent him with 400 men to the eastern part of the island to fight the Taínos in that region, the Higüey region. There he founded two new towns: "Santa Cruz de Hicayagua", or "Icayagua", the present city of Santa Cruz del Seibo; and "Salvaleón de Higüey".

In 1509, the new Governor of the Hispaniola, Diego Columbus, sent Juan de Esquivel with 70 men to Jamaica to complete the conquest of that island. He founded a town, "Sevilla La Nueva" (in English, "The New Seville") on the north coast.

He died in Jamaica about 1513.

Many of you know we've had a user who edits via IPs and makes, typically, POV edits about Pakistan (and surrounding nations). In particular, articles in the form of "Pakistan-Other nation relations" are common, unsourced, and often not simple. Could we form consensus on how to approach this editor? I can think of, essentially, two options: 1) we review all edits individually as we have done before and keep/delete appropriately, or 2) we agree to community ban this editor and nuke all contribs on sight. The second option is extreme, but we have enough work making good articles about Apples and the colour Orange without needing to sift through these! In particular, see the edits by for an example of what I am referring to. Comments appreciated! 15:48, 12 September 2009 (UTC)


(un indented on purpose) Ok, I know I'm fairly new here so obviously have a slightly quieter voice but... reading this thread just raised my blood pressure a bit. I was about to offer to go through all of the contributions to see what needed to be deleted and what could just be brought into compliance (and, of course, what already was). Doing this would also allow us to try and figure out if we could work with the guy or if that was improbable. He appears to be working with and I believe anyone who is doing so should be treated with respect. If they are doing things we don't like and see as a problem for the project then I feel we have an obligation to try and work with them and help them to understand our concerns. In the end even if we decide that we will be unable to work them because of unresolvable issues then a is the worst we should do unless at some point the user goes from a good faith vandal to a bad one. Special:Nuke (in my opinion) should only be used as a last resort option for obvious and unquestionable vandals. I believe it is inappropriate for anyone who even COULD be offering legitimate content.

That being said: I do not believe there was any form of consensus in the discussion above. There were 2 people who wanted to work with the individual and 3 people who wanted to get rid of them (through a nuke and ban combo). It was also a discussion that has been open for less then 3 hours before it was marked done. When we are discussing a total ban of a user from the project (especially one using nuke) I can not think of any appropriate time to close a discussion within 3 hours even if a consensus HAD been formed. I had just found this thread and was going to respond when I noticed the 2nd part of the discussion and just ended up confused. 

Is there an UnNuke feature? If there is I would like to ask another admin to reverse until we are able to finish the discussion. I would also really like to here why Scream felt this was important enough to act so quickly on. () 22:52, 12 September 2009 (UTC)


(<-)Ok, very basically:
That being said, there are also some positive points:
So in very short: If you want to try to establish communication, please go ahead. Also note that blocking the editor so far has shown little effect; he has been back after the block expired. If we could establish communication, I could see the a GA (or VGA) on a Pakistan-related topic on the horizon. I cannot help with history and knowledge, but I am prepared to review articles to point out what they still need, and to some extent, help fix the issues involved.
Anyway, in the last discussions I have always shown some "bias" to one side, so I think it would probably be good to get uninvolved perspectives. -- () 10:12, 13 September 2009 (UTC)

Ok, this was made easier because I have less desire to provide a lot of links since Eptalon was great and provided them while I was writing (and sidetracking). I totally understand why people are frustrated by this editor but to be honest I'm torn. As a project we want as much of the best content we can get. Preferably we have a wide variety of topics from around the globe. We also are the encyclopedia(s) that anyone can edit, though of course "anyone" is going to be understandably limited when it comes to people who are being disruptive. 

The honest fact is that even after going through all the discussions and most if not all of the guys contributions spread out over an amazing amount of IPs I am STILL not comfortable just labeling him as a "vandal." (with the period being spoken). Looking through the articles on Pakistan there is some very good material that has been added by what appears to be the same person. Adding images like is a great example of something that added to the encyclopedia and likely wouldn't have been done in any timely fashion (if at all) by someone else, pictures like that (which are not on En) are great for Simple.

While I'm still not totally sure about his with everything it is clear that YES he has/is caused/causing disruption within the project (and maybe worse, the small community it has). It is quite clear he pushes one over and over again. I am fairly certain that the editor is the same editor who "corrects" thing across a broad spectrum of wikis that I have seen in the past couple weeks doing SWMT work. Unfortunately that makes it quite likely that it is a DRIVING force behind his edits which makes me sad because it makes it much less likely that we will get him to change. The amount of discussion about the problem with no conclusion, outreach to the IPs without resolution and warnings regarding the conduct without change concern me especially given my disbelief that he does not understand at least some of what is said to him given his location (per whois). I also agree that it appears to be one person, or at the very least interrelated people, given that every single ip geolocates to similar locations within the UK. 

I think it's high time this was resolved as much as possible.I absolutely abhor the idea of protecting all of the pages under a long standing belief that IPs should be able to edit as freely as possible. That doesn't mean I don't understand the desire to do it since it is much easier then blocking every new IP that pops up (you would have to blacklist basically everything to do with Pakistan to). I do think that if you wanted to do this correctly it would be an enormous amount of protections and filter changes. It is also quite clear that the user changes IPs frequently and those IPs are all over the spectrum, it would be futile to try and range block them all (even if you didn't cut off half the internet doing so). The other issue is that despite what we chose to do we need to cull through basically every article that mentions Pakistan/Kashmir and decide what is notable enough to keep as an article and cull out POV crap that is everywhere. Hopefully this can be done by multiple people because it will not be a short task.

Obviously anyone can make additional proposals but these are the options I see:

1. Ignore it completely let them edit - "obviously not really an option"

2. Let them edit but cull through everything they add and make sure it works in the project - "I think would quickly result in burn out by those involved in the editing and would likely result in the user getting angry and becoming more of a normal vandal."

3. Revert vandalism and warn user as we see it (blocking as we go along when they don't listen) - "basically what I see as the status quo, we've seen that this lets a lot fall through the cracks that isn't seen by the vandalism patrollers (either because no one was watching at the time or that particular person didn't see the POV problem when it streamed by." 

4. Have someone decide to reach out to the user on their talk page, maybe try to get them to come to IRC etc and work with them to become a legitimate an less controversial editor on the project. If it doesn't work we come back here.

5. Ban them outright, by community consensus. Ban is enforced by immediate blocks for any ip that edits an on topic article that geolocates to that location/exhibits that behavior. Ban length is as long as admins are willing to block an IP with IPs that seem to be static (being used over and over after unblock) blocked either indefinitely or for very long periods of time.

6. Some combination of 4+5 - "my preference, see below"

I would prefer a combination of 4 and 5:

I don't want to just try and reach out and then be right back here once someone decides we've been reaching out to long without response (or get a response and it doesn't pan out) and then either have to have the debate again or go back to the status quo with spotty and inconsistent enforcement across admins.

I also don't really want to do a straight ban because I still think that they could be a valid resource to the project and whenever possible we want to try to encourage that. A focus is NOT a bad thing it just can't get in the way of .

My thought would be sort of multi phased. We have to agree on a plan off attack here and follow through with it:

a) Agree to the terms of a ban preferably terms that we think will be as easy as possible for admins to enforce. 

b) Agree on terms to offer to the IP to allow them to continue (Create an account, work with us on POV etc)

c) Agree on concrete triggers that repeal the offer and begin the full Ban immediately

d) Offer the terms (and the ban triggers) on the currently banned IPs talk page along with hopefully a link to talk on IRC since most of us are there.

e) follow through, if we make contact follow through with that and try to work with them. If we don't make contact or they don't listen then regrettably a ban it is. A ban agreed upon by the community and enforced until the community agrees to remove it.

Ok.. enough rambling on this topic for now (though I have more to say regarding the topic closure thing above, that's later). Please let me know what you think in the end that's what matters I'm just one outspoken and verbose wikipedian :) () 16:28, 13 September 2009 (UTC)

I wandered by this site the other day and it seems that hard-banned user Bambifan101, aka "The Disney Anon" and "The Disney Vandal" has been hard at work here over the last several months adding and editing articles via his shifting BellSouth IP in Mobile, Alabama. He is literally all over this site re. Disney films and features and I've been spending the last ten minutes or so tagging some of his creations for speedy deletion. I have admin rights on English, but not here or I'd handle these myself. He also knows better than to show his face over there because I and several other users are on the lookout. May I impose on someone to please, "please" just delete this idiot's entries? Perhaps he'll get the message and leave. Otherwise, he's just laughing in our faces. Thanks for letting me rant. -- () 19:11, 25 September 2009 (UTC)

If they come back as BellSouth in Mobile, it's him without question. I've blocked him more times than I can count over at the other site and virtually all of the anon IPs come back as BellSouth. Those which do not render back to BellSouth at least render back to the general geographic area. En-wiki basically states that any creation by a hard-banned user whether it's useful or not may be deleted. In all honesty, there have been edits to most of the articles I tagged which on English generally means they become keepers. This person is a special case, having spent more than three years trashing this site and English as well. I'm not for a "de facto" deletion of a good article, but I am in favor of sending this nut a clear message. I honestly believe he's autistic given his dogged, single-minded edit habits. Add to that a dynamic IP and voila! Tons of cleanup work. -- () 20:15, 25 September 2009 (UTC)

Anything is better than nothing. If you check my talk page over at English, a user just alerted me to a sock which I failed to block and sure enough, it's BellSouth. Here's the link to my page: . Believe me, I'm more than happy to block him at English and blow the whistle over here. Check out that, um, conversation between he and I on his most recent sock's talk page. -- () 20:25, 25 September 2009 (UTC)

Articles which are simply copied from en.wiki with little sign of simplification (which seems be a stock trade of this editor) are clearly deletable under speedy criteria. Secondly, typically we delete or revert edits by banned editors no matter what. This was always intended to discourage banned editors from attempting to continue to edit. Majorly, you said we "removed the speedy criteria for banned accounts" - can you clarify this or point me to the discussion please? Cheers. () 15:57, 26 September 2009 (UTC)



I must say, PMDrive, that I strongly suspect that every time you make a fuss about Bambifan and draw attention to him on threads such as this, he will be "laughing in our faces" as you put it. He probably loves it when you bring him up here. I also expect he gets a thrill when we delete his articles. I've not seen any convincing argument as to why we should delete articles based on who wrote them, if they meet our policies. Deleting such articles is pure wikipolitics and against the interests of an encyclopedia anyone can edit. All it achieves is drawing attention to him. 17:49, 26 September 2009 (UTC)

<-- I'm going to bed, I've been up to long and just had an enormous exam :( and have work tonight :(. But.. seriously I'll leave my brief synopsis :) Please wait... :( we seem to jump to fast sometimes...Also good articles are good articles.

There is an account on the English Wikipedia called "Mythdon13" impersonating me by making edits are appear to be in good faith, but hard to assume that they are in reality.

We've talked about these guys on IRC a couple times and sort of brushed it off but I wanted to bring it up here so that more could see and comment and for mostly a heads up. There is a set of what appears to be 3 accounts , and who appear that they could be related. Both Dkes and Napoleon were created on the same day (September 20th) about 6 hours apart. Napoleon was created and started editing at 0245, Dkes was created and started editing the same pages at 0818 about 20 minutes or so after Napoleon stopped for the day. Napless was created on the 21st (at 0314) and proceeded to edit the same pages. Since then they have basically gone in cycles, Napoleon, Dkes, Napless never at the same time, always the same articles and writing style and almost always in that order. So far there has not been any real "oddness" and so even if they are socks there really isn't a reason to block them but was just a little weird. Well no oddness until () 09:36, 29 September 2009 (UTC)

Hello all! I want to nominate Röhm for a VGA. I think it meets our criteria and hope for a lot of input. All comments are welcome. I'll try to address all concerns as fast as even possible. () 18:12, 10 September 2009 (UTC)


No red links, comprehensive, stable, illustrated, I "think" this meets everything we want in a VGA. () 17:19, 15 September 2009 (UTC)



To the best of my knowledge, all of the concerns from the previous pvgood nomination have been addressed. It's fairly short, but there's no missing substantial information. – |  19:16, 22 September 2009 (UTC)

I got it up to around 4.7 kb. – |  02:05, 27 September 2009 (UTC)

Closed as not promoted. "There is only about 4.4kb of info (5KB required). It has not been worked on in almost two weeks, and the only person that discussed this said no, unless it met 5KB. Sorry, () 22:47, 16 October 2009 (UTC)"

There are a few red links that i'll be creating shortly, but other than that I think that this article is read for VGA status. Please let me know if anything needs doing. Thanks, 15:58, 22 September 2009 (UTC) 


Closed as promoted: All concerns have been fixed. Seeing that no more issues have been raised; I close this as promoted. Good work on the article. :)   15:33, 20 October 2009 (UTC)

Sufficiently long, has sources and is comprehensive. There used to be a complex tag and so I'd like to get a review to know how to simplify it. Only 5 redlinks and a few template errors are there which will be easy to handle. 11:20, 30 September 2009 (UTC)


Meets most criteria. Sufficiently long. Sources need formatting which I'll do.   09:54, 4 October 2009 (UTC)

Probably needs lots of work as it's fairly complex, and it's not quite finished yet... but I think it has VGA potential so please help :) Cheers, 00:01, 23 October 2009 (UTC) 
(Unindenting) Clearly you don't understand , otherwise you wouldn't have referred to the article as 'my' or asked another editor to leave it alone until you had finished with it. We're all working towards the same goal here, if PMlineditor (or any other editor) sees a problem with the article he can fix then why not? You should be happy, because the article is being improved. 16:57, 2 November 2009 (UTC)
Withdrawn - per Bluegoblin7's request.

I'd like to put this forward for a VGA. It's something non-transport after all! ;) 11:32, 23 October 2009 (UTC) 

Needs some work doing to it, but by the time someone reviews it it will be done ;) I think this will meet all the VGA criteria :) 11:29, 22 October 2009 (UTC) 


Sufficiently long, several refs. It's a GA already and can be a good enough for VGA.   16:46, 26 October 2009 (UTC)

Simplified and rewritten. Should be good to go now. – |  18:27, 2 November 2009 (UTC)

All done. – |  16:28, 11 November 2009 (UTC)

It does need some more work, and is not quite complete, but I believe that it has the potential to be a VGA and so am nomnomnoming it. Comments please. 12:14, 16 November 2009 (UTC) 


Alright, the rest looks good to me. – |  17:06, 23 November 2009 (UTC)

Closed as promoted: Good job on the article! 21:18, 24 November 2009 (UTC)

Needs a bit more work, but otherwise, it is still one of the best articles that I think we have to offer. There are five redlinks left, and some references could be found with more sourcing, but other than that, this article is extremely long with 83(!) references, so I think it is a definite VGA candidate. It was a VGA before, but I added in the Government section, which added more redlinks. They are now being phased out, which will make them gone fairly shortly. 13:37, 12 November 2009 (UTC)

Another transport article i'm afraid, here's my latest offering for VGA (Yes, I know about the redlinks...) Cheers, 23:07, 26 November 2009 (UTC) 

Still some work to be done - as well as redlinks - but I believe that this article is in VGA shape. And it's not transport related! 23:52, 1 January 2010 (UTC) 

Previously failed to become a VGA due to outstanding concerns. I've fixed most of the concerns and referenced the article. Few redlinks remain to be created. However, the rest is done. Comments are welcome.   10:55, 9 January 2010 (UTC)

Reading through the article, the requirements again to make sure and all the comments and changes from here and the talk page I think I'm comfortable that the article is clearly ready to gain VGA status so:
Closed as promoted " ( )" 11:21, 31 January 2010 (UTC)

Bringing this back to PVGA now that i've done some more work on it and done all the redlinks. Comments please! 16:53, 1 January 2010 (UTC) 
(unindent) So you are allowed to make bold closures and no-one else is? This system needs voting, not in the 'x support votes = promotion' way but an easier way for people to tell when to promote and when to not, without pointless and nigh on endless discussions. The reason you have closed pretty much every request/promote is because no-one else is doing so. Like I said it's stagnating. 22:22, 8 January 2010 (UTC)

A wonderful article. No red links and has good length. A bit more references and it would be perfect. 19:52, 26 January 2010 (UTC)

Informative about the characters from Tolkiens books. Perhaps only people who actually has read the books should comment on this article. () 18:18, 17 January 2010 (UTC)

Well referenced, informative, reasonably long. You really get to know everything about the planet Neptune. () 18:06, 17 January 2010 (UTC)

Good references, very interesting reading, good length, quality article. -- () 17:05, 24 January 2010 (UTC)






And on that note, there are vast swaths of this article which are completely unreferenced, and that itself makes this unacceptable for becoming one of our very best articles. The refs that do exist need to be formatted and filled in correctly. There are still MOS issues, there's still a redlink, the table seems to be malformed, the "other websites" are just an arbitrary bunch of semi-relevant links. This has a way to go. () 15:28, 13 February 2010 (UTC)

Many references, coverage of all aspects of the TV-series, good length. -- () 18:00, 26 January 2010 (UTC)
MOS problems (placement of references, overuse of bold, incorrect use of hyphens, mixture of date formats in refs, periods in captions with incomplete sentences), red links in the references, several debatable "reliable" sources, three non-existent categories, actually "terrible" English e.g. "We continue to Kevin Tod Smith with 31 appearances, Hudson Leick and Karl Urban with 12 and Alexandra Tydings with 11. In the last episode, the eastern star Michelle Ang playing Akemi. t", this is absolute opposition in no uncertain terms to this being promoted. A massive amount of work to be done. () 22:41, 3 February 2010 (UTC)

In the section "Production", there is "very" few links. Just to name "some" of them that could be linked are:New Zealand, American, Actress, Bruce Campbell, Lyrics, Series, and much much more. Combined with TRM comments, this article needs loads and loads of work. Do not worry about the link problem, I will fix that one myself. ♠♣♦♥ 18:02, 15 February 2010 (UTC)

I think this is a very well-written article that explains the subject clearly without being boring. -- () 12:48, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

Al-Ghazali

Abū Ḥāmid Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Ghazālī (1058-1111) (), often Algazel in English, was born and died in Tus, in the Khorasan province of Persia. He was an Islamic theologian, jurist, philosopher, cosmologist, psychologist and mystic of Persian origin, and remains one of the most celebrated scholars in the history of Sunni Islamic thought. 

He is considered to be a pioneer of the methods of doubt and skepticism, and in one of his major works, "The Incoherence of the Philosophers", he changed the course of early Islamic philosophy. He changed the early Islamic philosophy away from an Islamic metaphysics influenced by ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophy. The new way was towards an Islamic philosophy based on cause-and-effect that was determined by God or intermediate angels, a theory now known as occasionalism.

Ghazali has sometimes been celebrated in both the East and the West as the greatest Muslim after Muhammad.

Duke Ellington

Edward Kennedy "Duke" Ellington (April 29, 1899 – May 24, 1974) was an American composer, pianist, and Big band leader. He was one of the most important musicians in the history of recorded music, and is called one of the greatest figures in jazz music. He also played blues, gospel, pop, and classical music. He worked for 60 years. He became even more popular after he died. He was given a special award citation from the Pulitzer Prize Board in 1999. 

Ellington called his music "American Music", not "jazz". Some of the people who played in Ellington's band were also famous or important jazz musicians.

Ellington led his band from 1923 until he died of lung cancer in 1974. His son Mercer Ellington took over the band until he died of cancer in 1996. Then Paul Ellington, Mercer's youngest son, took over the band.
Edward Kennedy Ellington was born on April 29, 1899. His parents were called James Edward Ellington and Daisy Kennedy Ellington. They lived with Daisy's parents in Washington, D.C. James Edward Ellington (J.E.) was born in Lincolnton, North Carolina on April 15, 1879 and moved to Washington, D.C. in 1886 with his parents. Daisy Kennedy was born in Washington, D.C. on January 4, 1879. Her father had been an American slave. J.E. worked for the United States Navy. He also worked as a butler for a white doctor. He occasionally worked as a caterer at the White House. Daisy and J.E. were both piano players.

When he was seven, Ellington began learning to play the piano. Daisy helped her son to learn good manners. Ellington’s friends noticed that he acted like a gentleman,
and gave him a nickname, "Duke"." At first, Ellington was more interested in baseball than playing the piano. He later remembered President Theodore Roosevelt watched him play baseball. Ellington went to Armstrong Technical High School in Washington, D.C. His first job was selling peanuts at Washington Senators baseball games. This job helped him to become more confident.

In 1914, Ellington wrote his first song. He had a job in a café, serving soda, using a soda fountain. His song was called "Soda Fountain Rag". He could not read or write music yet. Ellington missed a lot of piano lessons and did not think he was very good at it. When he was 14 he heard pianists playing in a poolroom. He was inspired to try harder with his piano playing.

He heard the piano played in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and Atlantic City. He tried to copy the styles he heard. He started to learn about harmony, and learned to read and write music. He started to play gigs in cafés and clubs in Washington, D.C. He had a scholarship to study art at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn in 1916 but he decided to concentrate on his music instead.

Between 1917 and 1919, Ellington started his professional music career. During the day, he had a job painting signs. At night, he played the piano. Sometimes, he got work playing the piano from people that he met in his other job. He started his first band, "The Duke’s Serenaders". They played in Washington, D.C. and Virginia at dances and parties. The other musicians in his band were Otto Hardwick, on bass and then saxophone; Arthur Whetsol on trumpet; Elmer Snowden on banjo; and Sonny Greer on drums. They played for both white and black people, which was unusual then.

List of Slipknot band members

Slipknot is a heavy metal band from Des Moines, Iowa. The band started in 1995 by vocalist and percussionist Anders Colsefini, guitarists Donnie Steele and Josh "Gnar" Brainard, bassist Paul Gray, drummer Joey Jordison,and percussionist Shawn Crahan. Before the band released its first album in 1999, Slipknot has gone through many line-up changes. After their first album, the line-up has stayed the same. The band is known for having a lot of members. The current members include a lead singer, two guitarists, a bassist, a drummer, two percussionists, a sampler, and a turntablist.

In 1996, when the band finished recording their demo album "Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.", Slipknot saw its first line-up change when guitarist Donnie Steele left the band and was replaced by Craig Jones. Shortly after, drummer Jordison said they needed a full-time sampler and Jones took the position as "he liked doing that anyway." Mick Thomson then joined the band to be the new guitarist. After "Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat." was released, the band were working on new songs which needed more singing melody and the then-lead singer Colsefini had a hard time with this. In 1997, Corey Taylor was asked to join the band and after practicing with Slipknot "everything just clicked." Because of that, Colsefini was moved to backing vocals and percussion. However Colsefini was unhappy with his new role and left the band a month later.

Since the band wanted to keep their percussive sound, Greg Welts joined the band to replace Colsefini. Towards the end of 1997, each band member picked an a number to identify themselves. In 1998, Welts became the only member to be kicked out of the band and he was replaced by Chris Fehn. Slipknot wanted to have a DJ in the band, but had a hard time finding one because "the people [they] knew who were DJs all sucked!" Sid Wilson approached the band after seeing them live. He proceeded to impress the band with his ability and his antics; Wilson was considered "Slipknot material" and his hiring brought the band's line-up to nine members. The final change in the band's line-up came at the latter stages of the recording process of the band's debut album, "Slipknot", in 1999. While the band took a break from recording the album, Brainard decided to leave the band and was replaced by Jim Root.

Little River (Withlacoochee River)

The Little River forms the western boundary of Cook County, GA. It is dammed at Reed Bingham State Park forming a lake for fishing, swimming, and recreation. There are two interesting structures along the river near the Cook and Brooks County line. A few years ago, the Adel News ran a story about a "stone bridge" over the river. It still stands and was built entirely from poured cement. It was abandoned around 1940 when the road took a different path. About three miles south another bridge, with its middle section missing, crosses what looks like a small pond.

Pauli exclusion principle

The Pauli exclusion principle refers to the fact that certain particles cannot be at the same place at the same time, with the same energy. Only fermions (examples are protons, neutrons and electrons) are bound by the Pauli exclusion principle, while bosons (an example is a photon - light beam) are not. A more precise way to describe the Pauli exclusion principle is to say that two of the same kind of fermions cannot have the same quantum numbers. This principle was discovered by physicist Wolfgang Pauli in 1925. It is a very important principle in physics, because the particles that make up ordinary matter are fermions.

Anthropic principle

The anthropic principle is a principle that says that the universe is how it is because it must allow for the eventual creation of us, as observers. The anthropic principle was thought of in 1974, by the astronomer Brandon Carter.

There are two different kinds of anthropic principles: the "weak anthropic principle", and the "strong anthropic principle".

The original thoughts that Brandon Carter had were:

Weak anthropic principle: "We must be prepared to take into account the fact that our location in the universe is necessarily privileged to the extent of being compatible with our existence as observers."

Strong anthropic principle: "The Universe (and hence the fundamental parameters on which it depends) must be such as to admit the creations of observers within it at some stage."

Nagua

Nagua is a Dominican city and the head municipality of the María Trinidad Sánchez province, on the northeast (Atlantic) coast of the country.
It was a town of fishermen that became a city in the second half of the 20th century. The city of Nagua is almost at sea level.

The municipality has the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Samaná province to the southeast, the municipality of El Factor to the south, the Duarte province to the west and the municipalities of Cabrera and Río San Juan to the north.

It has an area of 552.71 km². There are three municipal districts in the municipality (a municipal district in the Dominican Republic are similar to municipalities but they depend on a municipality). Those municipal districts are:

The "Cordillera Septentrional" (in English, "Northern mountain range") runs along the western half of the municipality. Even if the mountains are not too high, most people live along the coast.

In the southwestern part of the municipality, on the border with the Samaná province, there is a region with swamps.

Rivers in Nagua are short; one of them is the river Nagua. The city and the region is named after this small river.

The municipality had, in 2002, a total population of 56,268: 28,745 men and 27,523 women. The urban population was 56.9% of the total population. In this numbers are included the population of Las Gordas municipal district.

Nagua was a small town close to the place where the river Nagua gets into the sea and that is the reason of its old name: "Boca de Nagua" (in English, "Nagua's Mouth"); it was part of the old municipality of Matanzas, Duarte province.

It was created a municipality in 1938 with the name "Villa Julia Molina" (Julia Molina was the mother of the dictator Rafael Trujillo). On 4 August 1946 there was a tsunami that destroyed the city of Matanzas and Villa Julia Molina became the main city of the region.

In 1945 the municipality became part of the Samaná province. With the creation of the new province of "Julia Molina" (now María Trinidad Sánchez), Villa Julia Molina became the head municipality of the province. The name of the city was changed to Nagua in 1961, after Trujillo's death.

Farming, cattle raising (mainly for milk), and fishing are very important around the city. Some important products are rice, coconut, and cacao.

Cultural Revolution

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (Simplified Chinese: 无产阶级文化大革命, Traditional Chinese: 無產階級文化大革命, Pinyin: Wúchǎn Jiējí Wénhuà Dà Gémìng, literally: Proletarian Cultural Great Revolution); shortened in Chinese as or ), also known simply as the Cultural Revolution, was a time of large cultural change in China, started by the leader Mao Zedong. It happened from 1966 to 1976.

The start of the Cultural Revolution was when Mao tried to remove capitalists from the Communist Party of China, the party in charge of China. To try and get rid of the capitalists, he started the Socialist Education Movement. It started in 1962 and ended in 1965. At the same time, a redoing of the school system made sure that students were able to also work in factories and . Mao slowly started to regain power in 1965, supported by Lin Biao, Jiang Qing, and Chen Boda.

The Communist Party was split between Mao's partners and Deng Xiaoping's partners. Deng Xiaoping was a rival of Mao. Mao then tried to get support from young people in China by creating the book Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong (also known as the Little Red Book), a collection of Mao's sayings. The Red Guard was also made popular. They were a group of young people in China that went around teaching Mao's sayings. They also beat people who disagreed with Mao and destroyed homes and museums. There were many fights breaking out, and China faced anarchy. During the revolution, several important people in China were forced to leave. These people included Liu Shao-chi, head of state, and Teng Hsiao-ping, the secretary-general of the Communist Party of China.

The Cultural Revolution began to slow down in 1967, and ended in 1969. The Ninth National Party Congress was a meeting where the end of the Cultural Revolution was announced.

The Cultural Revolution caused a lot of problems in China. Production in factories was lowered because of the workers' political activities. It was also lowered because the people put in charge of the factories did not know how to run them. Transportation was made worse because a lot of trains were being used to take Red Guards around the country. Many scientists and engineers were put in jail or sent to work on the farms, which meant that their knowledge was lost. Because of these changes, the industrial output of China was reduced by 14 percent.

The education of many Chinese people was also cut short. The education system was more in the cities than in the countryside. Universities and many schools were closed. A program called the "sent-down youth" program also disrupted education. In that program, children were sent from the cities to the countryside.

<doc id="199375" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199375" title="Great Leap Forward">
Great Leap Forward

The Great Leap Forward () was a plan that was created to increase China's economy and industry. It was started by the Communist leader Chairman Mao Zedong in 1957 and ended in 1960. The Great Leap Forward was bad for the Chinese people, as it ended up with many people dead. Some people think it to be the biggest famine in history.

Mao wanted China to be able to make food for the country and make food to export; he also wanted China to produce a lot of goods. He started the Great Leap Forward to do this. Some people were forced to give their land to the government. Many people had to work on farms for the government, also called "agricultural cooperatives". Later, these cooperatives were put together to involve thousands of people. In 1958, ninety-eight percent (98%) of people who worked on farms were in these cooperatives.

In 1958, there was a good harvest. However, this began to change the year after.

People believed that planting plants close together was good. They thought this because Stalin thought so too. However, crops did not grow as well when they were close together. This led to lower grain harvests in 1959. After that the harvests were bad also because resources were not used well. This lasted at least until 1961.

The change in China was put on a schedule. Mao wanted China to have a greater industrial output than Britain in fifteen years. He later shortened this to one year. If people did not like the fast pace of the schedule, they were usually killed. By 1958, 550,000 people were killed because they did not agree with the government.

Because the government spent a lot of money on industry, the country increased its debt. Many people wanted to help the government meet its goals, so they would build furnaces in their backyard. They would then try to make iron for tools. However, this did not work very well. People ended up melting good things, turning them into unusable things.

Leaders competed with each other to see who could make the most things. This led the farms to be forgotten. Leaders would also lie about the amount of crops being grown. They would tell the government that they were making more than they actually were. In 1959, the country began running out of food. This is because they sold their grain to other countries. This problem was made worse because the output of farms was decreasing. People were also not allowed to leave the areas they were living in. That meant that they could not look for food in other places. Some villages had one-fourth or one-third of people dying in them. Girls and old people were underfed. Infants and the very old were the first to die.

The famine is thought to have killed between 16.5 million and 40 million people.

The government tried to stop the famine by canceling orders for technology. Instead, they imported food for people to eat. However, the economy of China continued to fall after the end of the Great Leap Forward. Workers were stressed, and the Soviet Union took away its support of China.

Dream of the Red Chamber

Dream of the Red Chamber (also "Red Chamber Dream", "Hung Lou Meng" or "A Dream of Red Mansions") (), originally The Story of the Stone (), is thought to be a great work of Chinese literature and is one of the Chinese Four Great Classical Novels. The novel was written in the middle of the 18 century during the Qing Dynasty. Its author is thought to be Cao Xueqin (Chinese: 曹雪芹). Redology is the study of the book.

The book is based on Cao's family. It is meant to be a memorial to the women that he met when he was young, including friends, relatives and servants. This novel is thought to be one of the first feminist novels. It is also one of the first novels to be written in vernacular, not classical, Chinese.

The Legacy (professional wrestling)

The Legacy was a professional wrestling heel stable on World Wrestling Entertainment's Raw brand that consisted of Randy Orton, Ted DiBiase, Jr., Cody Rhodes, and former members Sim Snuka (Jimmy Reiher, Jr.) and Manu (Afa Anoa'i, Jr.). The stable was founded at Night of Champions when Cody Rhodes turned on Hardcore Holly forming "Priceless" with Ted DiBiase Jr. Legacy held the WWE Tag Team Championship twice with Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase holding the titles on two separate occasions. 
The roots of the team started December 10 2007, on the "Raw 15th anniversary", when Cody Rhodes and Hardcore Holly defeated Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch for the World Tag Team Championship.
They retained the championship in many matches, against fellow tag-teams such as Carlito and Santino Marella, and Paul London and Brian Kendrick.

Rhodes and Holly would then enter a feud with Ted Dibiase and his mystery partner, when DiBiase Jr. and The Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase, Sr., appeared in a segment on "Raw". DiBiase and his father, challenged Rhodes and Holly to a title match at Night of Champions (2008) against DiBiase (Jr.) and a mystery partner which they accepted. At Night of Champions DiBiase came to the ring unaccompanied and said his partner would be there. However, the bell rang and there was no partner for it to be a two on one handicap match. DiBiase demanded that he face Holly first and as DiBiase approached Holly, Holly was attacked by his tag team partner Rhodes, revealing that he was DiBiase's tag team partner, turning Rhodes heel and in the process. Rhodes and DiBiase became the new tag team champions.

After holding the titles for just over a month, they dropped it to John Cena and Batista on the August 4 edition of "Raw". The following week, DiBiase and Rhodes used their rematch clause to regain the title. Rhodes and DiBiase were joined by Manu, forming a stable of multi-generational superstars. On the October 27, 2008 edition of "Raw", Rhodes and DiBiase lost their titles to Kofi Kingston and CM Punk. During this time, Rhodes, DiBiase and Manu entered a storyline with Randy Orton where Orton constantly criticized and insulted them, and attacked DiBiase on November 7, on "Raw"; punting him in the head. At Survivor Series, Rhodes, along with Orton, was a sole survivor, for Orton's team, in the Elimination match.

Rhodes and Manu accepted Orton's offer to form an alliance a few weeks after the "DiBiase incident"; attacking John Cena along with Chris Jericho, and the trio dubbed themselves "The Legacy"; debuting the following week in a 2 on 3 handicap match against Batista and the WWE Champion Triple H , and although they were now a stable, neither one of the three made any changes in their attire.

The December 15th edition of "Raw" they defeated Batista and the World Heavyweight Champion John Cena, in a match where Orton punted Batista in the head, leaving him indefinitely inactive (actually due to a torn hamstring) , also that night Cody and Manu interfered in Rey Mysterio's match against Sim Snuka, giving a beating to Rey, who was later attacked by Mike Knox. , 

Randy Orton and Cody Rhodes and Ted Dibiase JR formed Legacy

The following week; December 22, Orton qualified for a Fatal Four Way Elimination Match, his opponent being the now unable to compete Batista, while the same night, Manu lost to Kofi Kingston in a one on one match, with Rhodes at ringside. 

After Orton grew tired of "The Legacy" losing matches, in an ongoing quest to mold his disciples; he informed Cody Rhodes, Sim Snuka and Manu that that very night they would have to complete their first test. Each man would have to compete in a singles match. Each man who won would have completed “step one,” any man who lost would be out of his "Legacy"; the only man that lost was Manu.

While same that night, Kelly Kelly confronted her real secret romance Randy Orton, After lying to Kane about his identity two weeks previous. After listening to Kelly Kelly berate him for not calling her back, Orton told Kelly that he didn’t need her to protect him against Kane. He then blew her off by telling her that he didn’t need any distractions while vying for the World Heavyweight Championship, this caused an alteration in between Kane and Orton, in a match where Kane jobbed to Kane, and thus ending the feud.

In the Elimination Fatal Four Way to determine who would follow to face John Cena at the Royal Rumble, in between Y2J, Orton, Shawn Michaels and JBL, just as Jericho prepared to lock JBL into the Walls of Jericho, Michaels laid out the first ever Undisputed Champion Chris Jericho with a Sweet Chin Music. Next up, it was Orton who found himself on the receiving end of Sweet Chin Music.

Orton opened Raw the night after the Royal Rumble, flanked by the members of the Legacy, Rhodes and DiBiase, as well as two lawyers and a therapist. He followed to reveal that he (kayfabe) suffers from IED (Intermittent Explosive Disorder, a mental condition that caused him to experience violent outbursts when provoked, losing all control of his emotions and actions). According to Orton and his therapist, WWE knew of the condition, and if fired, the Orton said that he planned on not only taking Rhodes and DiBiase with him, but also on bringing a lawsuit against the company. 

The leader of the Legacy then detailed his plans for a second lawsuit, suing for breach of contract if he is not granted the opportunity to compete in the main event of WrestleMania XXV, an honor he earned by defeating 29 other Superstars in the Royal Rumble Match the night before. Before leaving with Rhodes, DiBiase, his therapist and his lawyers, Orton issued a prepared, half-hearted apology to Mr. McMahon, his family and the WWE Universe.

At the close of the show, Stephanie McMahon entered the ring, expressing her desire to speak to Randy Orton face-to-face. Accompanied by his therapist, two lawyers, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase, the 2009 Royal Rumble winner made his entrance, reiterating the consequences waiting for Stephanie if she was to fire him: Two costly lawsuits being filed against WWE as well as DiBiase and Rhodes walking. The Legend Killer went even further, threatening to file an injunction to stop WrestleMania, the event at which he is guaranteed a World Title Match. 

After daring McMahon to fire him, the Raw General Manager announced that they had other plans for him – even beyond the Superstars that engulfed the ring. With that, Stephanie’s brother Shane McMahon made his entrance, and attacked Orton with such ferocity that it took the entire Raw roster to restrain him.

The following week Orton challenged McMahon to a No Holds Barred match at No Way Out, which Shane accepted.

The next week Orton faced The Undertaker and lost by desqualification, while Rhodes and DiBiase defeated Cryme Tyme. Orton would then go on to feud with then WWE Champion Triple H, for what Orton and Legacy had done to Triple H's family. On the March 2nd edition of Raw, Randy Orton chose to face Triple H in the main event at Wrestlemania 25. At Wrestlemania 25 Triple H would defeat Randy Orton after hitting him with a sledgehammer and a pedigree. The night after Wrestlemania 25, Orton had a one on one match with Mr. McMahon, just as Orton was about to go for the punt kick, Shane McMahon came to the aid of his father; this prompted Rhodes and DiBiase to come out and attack Shane; which then lead to Triple H coming out. As Legacy were attacking Triple H, Batista returned to attack Randy Orton for what he did to him in December of 2008.

On the February 22nd 2010 episode of Monday Night RAW, Orton made a 6-Man Tag Match because he was thinking Legacy needed to form together and Randy even said he was sorry but after Orton left the scene, it was revealed that Ted and Cody were planning to betray Randy once and for all but during the match, when Cody tagged Randy out, while entering the ring, Orton shockingly DDT'd Cody. Ted was in shock because he realized Orton figured out their plan which lead to Orton supposedly turning into a face and RKO'd Ted DiBiase right on the spot and left the arena leaving Evan Bourne to pin the fallen Cody Rhodes.

Besides the taxes in England, the term also applies to Eastern Europe in the 9th century, where Sami, Finish, and Slavic tribes paid taxes to the Swedes. In Francia (France), the Franks paid off the Vikings in Normandy (Normans), and in return, the Normans would convert to Christianity and cease to raid.

<doc id="199660" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199660" title="Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck">
Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck

Jean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet, Chevalier de la Marck, usually known as "Lamarck", (1 August 1744 – 18 December 1829) was a French soldier, naturalist and academic. He was one of the first people to suggest that organisms changed in accordance with natural laws. This is known as evolution.

Jean-Baptiste was the 11th child of Philippe Jacques de Monet de La Marck and Marie-Françoise de Fontaine de Chuignolles. His parents were nobles, but they were not well-off. His parents wanted him to become a priest. Starting at age eleven, he attended a Jesuit school in Amiens. After his father's death in 1759, Jean-Baptiste joined the army. Lamarck fought in the Pomeranian War with Prussia, and was awarded a medal for bravery on the battlefield. During his service, he was stationed in different forts in France, mostly at the eastern border, and the Mediterranean coast. At his post in Monaco, Lamarck became interested in natural history and resolved to study medicine. In 1766, he was injured. He retired from the army in 1768 and returned to his medical studies. He worked at a bank in Paris. From 1770 to 1774, he studied medicine at the university, but did not finish his studies with a degree. During this time, he met some of the well-known scientists of his day, such as the botanists Bernard and Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu, and the naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. 

Lamarck developed a particular interest for botany, and later, after he published a three-volume work "Flora française", he gained membership of the French Academy of Sciences in 1779. Lamarck became involved in the "Jardin des Plantes" and was appointed to the Chair of Botany in 1788. When the "Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle" was founded in 1793, Lamarck was appointed as a professor of zoology. In 1801, he published "Système des animaux sans vertèbres", a major work on the classifications of invertebrates. In an 1802 publication, he became one of the first to use the term "biology" in its modern sense. Lamarck continued his work as a top authority on invertebrate zoology. 

In the modern era, Lamarck is remembered mainly for a theory of the inheritance of acquired characters, called soft inheritance or Lamarckism. His major work on this subject was "Philosophie zoologique", Paris 1809.
His idea of soft inheritance was a reflection of the folk wisdom of the time, accepted by many natural historians. Lamarck's contribution to evolutionary theory was an early, perhaps the first, theory of evolution. In Lamarck's theory, an alchemical complexifying force drove organisms up a ladder of complexity. A second environmental force adapted them to local environments through "use and disuse" of characteristics, making them different from other organisms. Since these ideas cannot be reconciled with what we know about genetics, they are now history. 

Lamarck died in Paris in 1829. When he died, his family was so poor they had to apply to the Academie for financial assistance. Lamarck's books and the contents of his home were sold at auction, and he was buried in a temporary lime-pit.

Lamarck came into conflict with the widely respected palaeontologist Georges Cuvier, who was not a supporter of evolution:

After his death, Cuvier used the forum of a eulogy to denigrate Lamarck: 

Opposition to Lamark's theories became stronger when Mendel's genetics was rediscovered, but there were always common-sense doubts. Particular criticism came from Alfred Russel Wallace and August Weismann later in the 19th century. Here is an example:

Wallace's argument in short is:

May Coup

May Coup was a coup d'état that happened in Poland in May 1926. It was organised by the former Polish leader and national hero Józef Piłsudski to remove the "weak" democratic government from power. It started on 12 May and ended on 15 May.

Piłsudski and his followers were victorious and the Polish democracy was replaced with an authoritarian regime that remained in power until the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 that started World War II. After Piłsudski's death in 1935 the regime became more and more radical, with regular persecution of the political opponents, never changing into totalitarianism though.

<doc id="199743" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199743" title="Fritz Müller">
Fritz Müller

Fritz Müller (31 March 1821 – 21 May 1897), was a German biologist and doctor who went to live in southern Brazil. There he studied the natural history. He was an early supporter of Darwinism, and lived in Brazil for the rest of his life. Müllerian mimicry is named after him.

Unlike most of his contemporaries in Britain, Müller had what would be seen today as a normal scientific education at the universities of Berlin and Greifswald, culminating in a doctoral degree. Then, he decided to study medicine. As a medical student, he began to question religion and in 1846 became an atheist. Despite completing the course, he did not graduate because he refused to swear the graduation oath, which contained the phrase "so help me God and his sacred Gospel".

Müller was disappointed by the failure of the Prussian Revolution in 1848, and realised there might be implications for his life and career. As a result, he emigrated to South Brazil in 1852, with his brother August and their wives, to join Hermann Blumenau's new colony in the State of Santa Catarina. The colony, near the coast on the Itajaí River, was called Blumenau. In Brazil, Müller, living with his wife Caroline, became a farmer, doctor, teacher and biologist, sometimes employed by the provincial government, sometimes surviving on his own efforts, sometimes defending against Indians but always collecting evidence of life in the Atlantic forest. The climate here is sub-tropical, and the vegetation typical of the Brazilian coast: it is not rain forest.

In 1876 he was appointed as Travelling Naturalist to the National Museum in Rio de Janeiro. This was the ideal post for him: it gave him the opportunity to range over the whole of the Itajaí system and study anything that interested him. A series of reports published in the "Archivos" of the National Museum record this work. 

At last this, the best period of his life, was brought to an end indirectly, by the overthrow of the liberal monarchy of Dom Pedro II in 1889. The new Brazilian Republic was riddled with corruption and nepotism, and eventually there was a civil war in 1893-5. Travelling naturalists were to be based in Rio de Janeiro, and instructions were sent out. Müller refused point-blank and was dismissed, as was von Ihering in São Paulo.

In his retirement years Müller received many letters of support and offers of financial help (from Darwin, amongst others). His cousin Alfred Möller visited him, and eventually became his biographer. His rewards during life from the Brazilian state were minor; but his reputation now stands high. He was one of a half-dozen great naturalists to visit and work in South America during the nineteenth century. Humboldt, Darwin, Wallace, Bates, Spruce — and Fritz Müller. He was the only one of these to settle in Brazil for the rest of his life. A statue was erected to Müller in Blumenau in 1929.

A broad chronology of Müller's life is as follows: 

During his life Müller published oved 70 papers, mostly in German-language periodicals, some in English and Portuguese. The topics covered a range of natural history topics in entomology, marine zoology, and botany.

Müller's great discovery concerned the resemblance between two or more unpalatable species which are protected from predators capable of learning. The protection is often a noxious chemical, perhaps gained from the larva eating a particulat plant; or it may be a sting or other defence. It is an advantage for such potential prey to advertise their status in a way clearly perceptible to their predators; this is called "aposematic" or warning colouration. In Muller's case the prey were butterflies, and the predators usually birds or reptiles. 

The aposematic colours are most often some combination of red, yellow, black, white, whereas palatable animals are usually cryptic. The noxious animals may display by slow flying, and in general are prominently visible. Noxious animals usually have thick, leathery cuticles through which, at certain points, they extrude noxious fluids when pecked; they will often survive a 'trial'. 

In Müllerian mimicry an advantage is gained when unpalatable species resemble each other, especially when the predator has a good memory for colour (as birds, for instance, do have). Thus one trial may work to dissuade a bird from several species of butterfly which all fly the same 'flag'. Brazilian butterflies provide some of the most extraordinary examples of mimicry, and Müller, Bates and Wallace all had lengthy experience of this. All three traveller-naturalists believed firmly that such systems of mimicry could only come about by means of natural selection, and all of them wrote about it.

One of his favourite topics was the life habits of the stingless honey-bees "Melipoma" and "Trigona". They are protected by a venom which they squirt when disturbed. The local name for them is Cagafogo (fire-shitter). 

Another discovery was the dimorphism in midges of the family Blepharicereidae. There are two female forms with different mouth-parts: one sucks blood, the other takes nectar, as does the male. To prove the point to skeptics, he sexed the flies carefully, and reared them from pupae.

By studying living termites Müller was able to correct many errors to be found in text-books. For example, their caste system is organised quite differently from ants, since the castes contain members of both sexes, whereas in hymenoptera the castes are unisexual and the males are haploid. Termites are placed in a different order from ants, the Isoptera.

Much of Müller's botany was stimulated by the series of botanical works published by Darwin in the years after the "Origin". Müller made contributions in all these fields. After Darwin's "Fertilisation of Orchids" (1862) he spent years of work on orchids, sending observations to his brother Hermann and to Darwin. Darwin used some of this work in his second edition of 1877, and Hermann later became famous for his work on pollination. On "Climbing plants" (Darwin 1867) Müller sent a letter to Darwin listing 40 genera of climbing plants classified by their method of climbing. The next few months saw more observations, which Darwin had translated and published as Müller's first paper in English.

Müller became a strong supporter of Darwin. He wrote "Für Darwin" in 1864, arguing that Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection was correct, and that Brazilian crustaceans and their larvae could be affected by adaptations at any growth stage. This was translated into English as "Facts and Arguments for Darwin" in 1869. If Müller had a weakness it was that his writing was much less readable than that of Darwin or Wallace; both the German and English editions are hard reading indeed, which has limited the appreciation of this significant book.

Extensive correspondence exists between Müller and Darwin, and Müller also corresponded with Alexander Agassiz, Ernst Krause, and Ernst Haeckel.

John Hope, 1st Marquess of Linlithgow

John Adrian Louis Hope, 1st Marquess of Linlithgow KT, GCMG, GCVO, PC (25 September 1860 - 29 February 1908), known as Viscount Aithrie before 1873 and as The 7th Earl of Hopetoun between 1873 and 1902, was the first Governor-General of Australia. 

Hope was born at South Queensferry, West Lothian in Scotland. He was the eldest son of the 6th Earl of Hopetoun. He was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, where he passed in 1879 but did not join the Army. He looked after the family houses and lands. In 1883 he became active in the House of Lords. He served as a Lord in Waiting from June 1885 to January 1886 and August 1886 to August 1889.

In 1889 he was made the Governor of Victoria, where he served until 1895. He went back to the United Kingdom and was made a privy councillor. He became the Paymaster-General from 1895 to 1898, and then Lord Chamberlain until 1900. The Australian colonies joined together to form the Commonwealth of Australia from 1 January 1901. Hopetoun was well liked in Victoria and he knew all the important Australian politicians. This made him a good choice to be the first Governor-General of the Commonwealth, and he was appointed in July 1900. In India, on his way to Australia, he got typhoid fever and his wife got malaria. They arrived in December 1900.

Hopetoun's first job was to choose a Prime Minister to form a government, which would start on 1 January 1901. The first elections were not going to be held until March, so he could not choose the leader of the biggest political party in the House of Representatives. Instead, he asked Sir William Lyne, the Premier of the largest state, New South Wales, to be Prime Minister

While this was a reasonable choice, Lyne had opposed federation and was unpopular with the leading federalist politicians. Alfred Deakin and other important politicians told Hopetoun they would not work with Lyne. Hopetoun then asked Edmund Barton, the leader of the federal movement and the man everybody thought should be the Prime Minister. This became known as the "Hopetoun Blunder".

There were soon more problems. Hopetoun had brought his own Official Secretary, Captain Edward William Wallington. The Australians did not want an Englishman in charge of official business. They also did not like the regal pomp and ceremony that Hopetoun used in his position, and the money that this cost. He acted as if ruled Australia with the Prime Minister. This was not what writers of the Constitution had wanted.

Hopetoun became friends with Melbourne anarchist and union pioneer, John 'Chummy' Fleming. In May 1901, Fleming protested against unemployment in Melbourne by rushing onto the Prince's Bridge to stop the Governor-General's carriage. Hopetoun listened to Fleming talk about the problems of the unemployed. According to some reports, Hopetoun made the government speed up work projects.

Finally, there was a problem with how much the Governor-General should be paid to have a house in both Sydney, the largest city, and Melbourne, the home of the Australian government. The Commonwealth and Victorian parliaments would not pay Hopetoun more money. Hopetoun resigned in May 1902. He and his family left Australia (from Brisbane) on 17 July 1902. He knew he had failed in a historic role. He was created 1st Marquess of Linlithgow on 27 October 1902, while he still the Governor-General. His term officially ended on 9 January 1903. He was made Secretary for Scotland in 1905.

He died suddenly on 29 February 1908, in Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, France.

On 18 October 1886 he married Hersey Everleigh-de-Moleyns, daughter of the fourth Baron Ventry. They had four children;


His son Victor, the 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow became the longest-serving Viceroy of India 1936-43, a job he had always wanted. His grandson Lord Glendevon married the daughter of the English novelist W. Somerset Maugham.

Henry Walter Bates

Henry Walter Bates (Leicester, 8 February 1825 – London, 16 February 1892) was an English biologist who explored the Amazon Rainforest. 

This naturalist and explorer gave the first scientific account of mimicry in animals. Batesian mimicry is named after him. He was most famous for his expedition to the Amazon River basin with Alfred Russel Wallace in 1848. He spent 11 years in the rain forest. 

When Bates arrived home in 1859, he had sent back over 14,000 species (mostly of insects) of which 8,000 were new to science.

In 1847 Wallace and Bates discussed the idea of an expedition to the Amazon. The plan was to defray expenses by sending specimens back to London, where an agent would sell them for a commission. Also, for the travellers to ""gather facts towards solving the problem of the origin of species"", as Wallace put it in a letter to Bates. 

The two friends, who were both by now experienced amateur entomologists, met in London to prepare themselves by viewing South American plants and animals in the main collections.

Bates and Wallace sailed from Liverpool in April 1848, arriving in Pará (now Belém) at the end of May. For the first year they settled in a villa near the city, collecting birds and insects. After that they agreed to collect independently.

Eventually, Bates' health deteriorated and he returned to England, sending his collection by three different ships. He didn't want to put all his insects into one boat. Bates wrote a famous book on his experiences: "The naturalist on the river Amazons".

<doc id="199756" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199756" title="Alfred Russel Wallace">
Alfred Russel Wallace

Alfred Russel Wallace OM, FRS,(8 January 1823 – 7 November 1913) was a British naturalist, explorer, biologist and social activist. He is best known for proposing a theory of natural selection. This was published in 1858 together with Charles Darwin's idea.

Wallace did extensive natural history exploring. He went first to the Amazon River basin with Henry Walter Bates, and later to Malaya and Indonesia. He wrote books on both these adventures. While in Indonesia he drew the "Wallace Line" which divides Indonesia into two parts. On one side are animals of Australasia. On the other side are species mostly of Asian origin. He wrote a wonderful book on the distribution of animals. 

After a few years of working as a railway surveyor with his brother, Wallace's life was changed by meeting Henry Walter Bates in Leicester in 1847. 

Wallace and Bates discussed the idea of an expedition to the Amazon. The plan was to defray expenses by sending specimens back to London, where an agent would sell them for a commission. Also, for the travellers to ""gather facts towards solving the problem of the origin of species"", as Wallace put it in a letter to Bates. The two friends, who were both by now experienced amateur entomologists, met in London to prepare themselves by viewing South American plants and animals in the main collections.

Bates and Wallace sailed from Liverpool in April 1848, arriving in Pará (now Belém) at the end of May. For the first year they settled in a villa near the city, collecting birds and insects. After that they agreed to collect independently.

Wallace continued charting the Amazon for four years, collecting specimens and making notes on the peoples, the languages, the geography, flora, and fauna. On 12 July 1852, Wallace embarked for England on the brig "Helen". After twenty-eight days at sea, balsam in the ship's cargo caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship. All of the specimens Wallace had on the ship, most of his collection, were lost. He could only save part of his diary and a few sketches. Wallace and the crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by the brig "Jordeson".

From 1854 to 1862, age 31 to 39, Wallace travelled through the "Dutch East Indies" (now Malaysia and Indonesia), to collect specimens for sale and to study nature. Wallace collected more than 125,000 specimens in the Dutch East Indies (more than 80,000 beetles alone). More than a thousand of them represented species new to science. 

His observations of the clear zoological differences across a narrow strait in the archipelago led to his proposing the zoogeographical boundary now known as the Wallace Line. Bali and Lombok were two islands in the archipelago only 17 miles apart at the widest (28 km), roughly the same size and with the same climate, soil, elevation and aspect. Yet their flora and fauna were so different. 

"In this archipelago there are two distinct faunas rigidly circumscribed, which differ as much as do those of Africa and South America... yet there is nothing on the map or on the face of the islands to mark their limits. The boundary line passes between islands closer together than others belonging to the same group. I believe the western part to be a separated portion of continental Asia, while the eastern is a fragmentary prolongation of a former west Pacific continent".

Why was it, he wondered, that the animals and plants on the Bali side of the channel were of Asian types, while those on the Lombok side were Australasian in type? This had to mean that the western group had evolved from common western stock, while the eastern group had evolved from a common eastern stock. 

While he was exploring the archipelago, he refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on natural selection. In 1858 he sent an article outlining his theory to Darwin; it was published, along with a description of Darwin's own theory, in the same year.

Accounts of his studies and adventures there were eventually published in 1869 as "The Malay Archipelago". It became one of the most popular natural history travel journals of the 19th century. It was praised by Charles Darwin and Charles Lyell and by others, such as the novelist Joseph Conrad, who called it his "favorite bedside companion".

Unlike Darwin, Wallace began his career as a travelling naturalist already believing in evolution. Both he and Bates had read "Vestiges", a controversial work of popular science, published anonymously in 1844. This advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system, the earth, and living things. He also read Malthus's "Principle of population", which he says "twenty years later gave me the long-sought clue to the effective agent in the evolution of organic species". He meant by that the struggle for existence, which led Wallace to "natural selection".

Wallace wrote his ideas on the small isle of "Ternate", in what was then the Dutch East Indies. He was suffering from malaria. While the natives looked after him, his thoughts turned to Malthus's book. 
"I thought of [Malthus's] clear exposition of the 'positive checks to increase' – disease, accidents, wars, famine – which keep down the population... It then occurred to me that the same causes, or their equivalents, are
continually acting in the case of animals also... Why do some die and some live? And the answer came clearly, that on the whole the best fitted live... Then it suddenly flashed upon me, that this self-acting process would necessarily improve the race..." 
This was the origin of his letter to Darwin, which set out the idea of natural selection.

In 1864, Wallace published a paper, "The origin of human races and the antiquity of Man deduced from the theory of natural selection", applying the theory to human beings. Huxley had already published his view that evolution applied to mankind as it did to other living things.

Wallace thought that natural selection could not account for mathematical, artistic, or musical genius, as well as metaphysical musings, and wit and humour. He eventually said that something in "the unseen universe of Spirit" had interceded at least three times in history. The first was the creation of life from inorganic matter. The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals. And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in mankind. He also believed that the purpose of the universe was the development of the human spirit. 

Many, including Huxley, Hooker, and Darwin himself, were highly critical of these ideas. As one historian of science has pointed out, Wallace's views in this area were at odds with two major tenets of Darwinism. These are: evolution does not have a goal, and it is not aimed at or centered around mankind. It is thought by most biographers that his thinking on the evolution of man was influenced by his adoption of spiritualism, which happened at the same time.

Wallace was not a believer in revealed religion of any kind, but he did believe in spiritualism. This has puzzled biographers, who struggle to think why such a man would believe in spirits. Early in his life, he experimented with hypnosis, which was then doubted and criticised. He used some of his students in Leicester as subjects, with considerable success. Apparently, this persuaded him not to reject ideas which were doubted. Even when Huxley told him that one of his favourite mediums was a proven fraud, he refused to believe it. He preferred the evidence of his own experience.

Wallace's public support of spiritualism, and his defence of spiritualist mediums against allegations of fraud, damaged his scientific reputation. It strained his relationships with friends such as Bates, Huxley and Darwin, who felt he was overly credulous. Others became openly hostile to Wallace over the issue. Wallace and other scientists who defended spiritualism were subject to much criticism from the press, with "The Lancet", the leading English medical journal, being particularly harsh. The controversy affected the public's idea of Wallace for the rest of his career, though he was always respected in other ways.


Wallace had a wide range of interests, and wrote books about all of them. He wrote against vaccination, for phrenology, for spiritualism, for land nationalisation, against the moon having canals, and for social change and the progress and improvement of mankind. He did not believe in religion, but he did believe in spiritualism. He was a radical in politics, economics and social reform. He was a kind and honourable person, but he could be a tough opponent if he thought something unfair was going on. Even the titles of some of his books were sensational, as for example:


Wallace wrote about 22 books, depending on how one counts them.
His greatest works include:

Nikolai Vavilov

Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov (25 November 1887 – 26 January 1943) was a Russian botanist and geneticist. He is best known for showing how and where crop plants evolved. He devoted his life to agriculture: the study and improvement of wheat, corn, and other cereal crops.

By 1940, Vavilov had accumulated a collection of 200,000 plant seeds from the Soviet Union and from abroad. He was widely admired, but his life came to a terrible end. Vavilov repeatedly criticised a powerful but poor scientist, Trofim Lysenko. As a result, Vavilov was arrested, and died of starvation in a prison in 1943. Today Vavilov's name stands high. The "Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry" in St. Petersburg is named after him. It maintains one of the world's largest collections of plant genetic material.

This is mimicry in plants where a weed comes to look like a crop plant. Before herbicides, weeds were plucked by hand. This has been done for thousands of years. The weeds come to look like the crop because the weeders pick those weeds which look most different. Vavilovian mimicry is caused by unintentional selection by humans. The weeds that survive pass on their genes. Gradually, all the weeds look more like the crop plant.

An example is rye, a common Mediterranean species. Rye was originally just a weed growing with wheat and barley. Weeding made it like the crop. Like wheat, it came to have larger seeds and more rigid spindles to which the seeds are attached.

Rye is a tougher plant than wheat: it survives in harsher conditions. Having become a crop like the wheat, rye was able to become a crop plant in harsh areas, such as hills and mountains.

Gilbert White

Gilbert White (18 July 1720 – 26 June 1793) was a naturalist and bird lover.

White was born in his grandfather's vicarage at Selborne in Hampshire. He was educated by a private tutor in Basingstoke before going to Oriel College, Oxford University. He obtained his deacon's orders in 1746, being fully ordained in 1749. Then he held several curacies in Hampshire and Wiltshire, including Selbourne. White also held the office of Junior Proctor at Oxford and was Dean of Oriel College. In 1784 he became curate of Selborne for the last time, remaining so until his death. 

White is best known for the "Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne" (1789). This was a collection of his letters to Thomas Pennant, the leading British zoologist of the day, and the Hon. Daines Barrington, an English barrister and Fellow of the Royal Society. These letters contained White's discoveries about local birds, animals and plants. White believed in observing birds rather than collecting specimens. He was one of the first people to separate the similar-looking Chiffchaff, Willow Warbler and Wood Warbler by means of their song.

White is regarded by many as England's first ecologist and one of the founders of modern respect for nature.

<doc id="199791" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199791" title="Charles Lyell">
Charles Lyell

Sir Charles Lyell, 1st Baronet, (14 November 1797 – 22 February 1875) was a British geologist. He was the foremost geologist of his day, and an influence on the young Charles Darwin. His work was rewarded with a knighthood, and later he was created a hereditary baronet.

The house of his birth is in the Lowlands of Scotland. it is in the valley of the Highland Boundary Fault, one of the great features of Scottish geology. Round the house is farmland, but within a short distance to the north-west are the Grampian Mountains in the Scottish Highlands. 

Charles would have seen this view from his house as a child. He was also fortunate that his family's second home was in a completely different area: at Bartley Lodge in the New Forest, England. Both these places lit his interest in the natural world.

Lyell had private means, and earned more money as an author. He came from a prosperous family, worked briefly as a lawyer in the 1820s. He held the post of Professor of Geology at King's College London in the 1830s. From 1830 onward his books provided both income and fame.

Lyell's "Principles of Geology" was his most famous, most influential, and most important book. It was first published in three volumes, in 1830–33. The book was a development of the ideas of James Hutton, but with many additions, improvements and examples. The book established Lyell's credentials as an important geological theorist. It was a work of synthesis, backed by his own personal observations on his travels.

The central argument in "Principles" was that "the present is the key to the past". This was called by William Whewell 'uniformitarianism'. Geological remains from the distant past are explained by processes we can see operating now. Lyell's interpretation of geologic change as the steady accumulation of minute changes over enormously long spans of time was a big influence on the young Charles Darwin.

John Ray

John Ray (29 November 1627 – 17 January 1705) was an English naturalist, sometimes referred to as the father of English natural history.

Ray was a Protestant dissenter who had accepted the return of Charles II. He was ordained in London in 1660, but refused to sign the Act of Uniformity of 1662. The Act of Uniformity made the Book of Common Prayer compulsory in religious services, which was opposed by those of Puritan beliefs. So Ray was forced to resign his Fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge; he returned to his native village of Black Notley, near Braintree in Essex. After this, his most important scientific works were supported financially by the Royal Society, whose President at a critical time in the 1680s was Samuel Pepys.

Ray published important works on plants, animals, and natural theology. His classification of plants in his "Historia Plantarum", was an important step towards modern taxonomy. Ray rejected the system by which species were classified according to an either/or type system. Instead he classified plants by observation according to similarities and differences. Thus he advanced scientific empiricism against the deductive rationalism of the scholastics. He was the first person to give a biological definition of the term "species".

Ray published about 23 works, depending on how one counts them. The biological works were usually in Latin, the rest in English. For ease of reading, the titles below are in English.


Including the various editions, there are 172 works of Ray, of which most are rare. The only libraries with substantial holdings are all in England. The list in order of holdings is:

Wikipedia:Very good articles/Jupiter

Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System. It is the fifth planet from the Sun. Jupiter is classified as a gas giant. This is because it is very big and made up of gas. The other gas giants are Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Jupiter has a mass of 1.8986×10 kg or about 317.8 Earths. This is twice the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System put together.

Jupiter was known to the ancient Romans. They named it for the Roman god Jupiter. Jupiter is the third brightest object in the night sky. Only the Earth's moon and Venus are brighter. Jupiter has at least 63 moons. 55 of these moons are very small at less than 5 km wide. The four main moons are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. These moons are the largest. These four are called the Galilean moons. They are called this because they were discovered by the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System.

Vladimir Horowitz

Vladimir Samoylovich Horowitz (, "Vladimir Samojlovich Horovitz") (October 1, 1903 – November 5, 1989) was a Russian-American classical pianist. He is often said to be one of the best pianists of the 20 century.

Horowitz was born in Kiev, Russia (now Ukraine) to a Jewish family in 1903. He was the youngest of four children. His father was an engineer and his mother was a pianist. He first started piano lessons from his mother at an early age. In 1912 he joined Kiev University where he was taught by Vladimir Puchalsky, Sergei Tarnowsky, and Felix Blumenfeld. He performed Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3 in D Minor on his graduation. He then performed his first solo concert in Kharkiv in 1920.

Horowitz got more and more famous but was often paid in food rather than money because Russia wasn't very rich. Although performing in many concerts, he secretly wanted to be a composer. In 1925, he moved to the West, intending not to return.

On January 2, 1926, Horowitz played his first concert outside of Russia. He then played in many other places, such as Berlin, Paris, and London. He gave his first concerts in the United States in 1928. 

When World War II started in 1939, Horowitz decided to live in the U. S. He became an American citizen in 1944. Horowitz was very proud of being an American, and decided to make a piano version of Sousa's The Stars and Stripes Forever. He played many concerts to raise money for the war effort, and he asked people to call him "the American pianist." Horowitz began playing music written by an American composer, Samuel Barber, and gave the world’s first performances of the Barber's Piano Sonata and Excursions.

During World War II, Horowitz also played a lot of Russian music, giving the first performances in America of Prokofiev's Piano Sonatas Nos. 6, 7 and 8 (which were called "War Sonatas") and Kabalevsky's Piano Sonatas Nos. 2 and 3. 

Horowitz stopped playing concerts four times (1936 to 1938, 1953 to 1965, 1969 to 1974, and 1983 to 1985), as he was unsure that he was good enough, even when he was popular.

He made his television debut on September 22, 1968, in a concert at Carnegie Hall.

Horowitz was most well known for playing music written between 1830 and 1920. His 1932 recording of the Liszt Sonata is still considered by many to be the best ever, even though many other pianists have recorded it. Other pieces he was famous for were Scriabin's Étude in D-sharp minor, Chopin's Ballade No. 1 in G minor, and many of Rachmaninoff’s short pieces, including Polka de W.R. Horowitz was praised for his way of playing the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 3, and the composer said "he swallowed it whole. He had the courage, the intensity, the daring." Horowitz later became good friends with Rachmaninoff. Horowitz was also well known for playing quieter works like Schumann's Scenes of Childhood, Scarlatti sonatas, and some Mozart and Haydn sonatas.

Horowitz's way of playing often used large contrasts between soft and loud volumes. He was able to play louder than most other pianists, without making an ugly sound. His playing was also known for many different kinds of sounds – sometimes called tone colors. Horowitz was also famous for playing precise passages in octaves very fast.

Horowitz began making recordings in 1928. He recorded for several record labels. His most famous early records were Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3 with Albert Coates and the London Symphony Orchestra (the first time that piece was recorded) and Franz Liszt's Sonata in B minor. 
When Horowitz was not playing in public, he sometimes made recordings in his house. His recordings won many awards, and he continued recording until a few days before he died.

In 1986, Horowitz told his friends that “before I die, I want to see the land where I was born.” So, he decided to play two concerts in Russia. At the time, Russia and the United States were trying to be more friendly with each other, and Horowitz’s concerts were part of that effort. The concert in Russia’s capitol, Moscow, was shown on TV, and people in the audience could be seen wiping tears from their eyes.

When Horowitz returned to the United States, President Ronald Reagan gave him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Vladimir Horowitz died on November 5, 1989 in New York of a heart attack. He was 86.

<doc id="199814" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199814" title="Thomas Henry Huxley">
Thomas Henry Huxley

Thomas Henry Huxley PC PRS (4 May 1825 – 29 June 1895) was an English biologist. He was known as "Darwin's Bulldog" for his support of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Huxley was slow to accept some of Darwin's ideas, but he was wholehearted in his public support of Darwin. 

Huxley's 1860 debate with the English Bishop Samuel Wilberforce was a famous public event. The debate was about evolution, and it was widely reported in the press. Many thought Huxley won that debate, which helped Huxley's career, and the theory of evolution. Huxley also developed scientific education in Britain, and fought against the more extreme forms of religion. Huxley used the term "agnostic" to describe his own views on religion, a term which we use today.

Huxley had little schooling, and taught himself almost everything he knew. Remarkably, he became a great anatomist and zoologist. Later, he discussed the evolution of man and the apes. Another of his ideas was that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs, a view widely held today.

His activity in favour of evolution, and his public work on scientific education, had a big effect on society in Britain and elsewhere.

As a young man, Huxley went on a long voyage of discovery to the southern continents. He was Assistant to the Surgeon on the Royal Navy ship "HMS Rattlesnake". What he did was to collect sea animals, and study them. He went ashore in New Guinea and the eastern coast of Australia, to study the animals, and the native peoples. He fell in love with a girl in Sydney, Australia, and some years later they married and had children.

For nearly ten years he worked on the relationship of man to the apes. This led him into a clash with Richard Owen, a man who was disliked for his behaviour, but admired for his skill. The struggle between them ended in some severe defeats for Owen.

Huxley's public lectures grew into his most famous work "Man's place in Nature" (1863). There he deals with the evolution of man, before Charles Darwin published his "Descent of Man" in 1871.

In the book Huxley gives evidence for the evolution of man and apes from a common ancestor. It was the first book devoted to the topic of human evolution. The book proposed to a wide readership that "evolution applied as fully to man as to all other life".


Huxley was an important public figure. When he was young there were virtually no degrees in British universities in biology, and few courses. Most biologists of his day were either self-taught, or took medical degrees. By the time he retired there were professors in biology in most universities, and a broad agreement on what should be taught. Huxley was the single most influential person in this transformation. Huxley was for about thirty years evolution's most effective champion. For some, Huxley was ""the" leading English spokesman for science in the nineteenth century".

Huxley supported the reading of the Bible in schools. Huxley was against organised religion, but he thought the Bible's moral teachings and use of language helped English life. "I do not advocate burning your ship to get rid of the cockroaches".

However, what Huxley proposed was to create an "edited version" of the Bible, shorn of "shortcomings and errors... These tender children [should] not be taught that which you do not yourselves believe". The London School Board voted against his idea, but it also voted against the idea that public money should be used to support students attending church schools. Vigorous debate took place on such points, and the debates were written down in detail. Huxley said "I will never be a party to enabling the State to sweep the children of this country into denominational schools". The Act of Parliament which founded board schools allowed the reading of the Bible, but did not permit any particular religious doctrine to be taught.

It may be right to see Huxley as helping the secularisation of British society which gradually occurred over the following century. Ernst Mayr said "It can hardly be doubted that [biology] has helped to undermine traditional beliefs and value systems". Huxley more than anyone else was responsible for this trend in Britain.

Huxley worked on ten Royal and other commissions. The subjects included medical law, contagious diseases, vivisection; fisheries; universities in Scotland, and science education in Ireland. He was Inspector of Fisheries 1881–85, and held many awards from many universities. He was President of the Royal Society from 1883–1885. The British state made him a Privy Councillor, as a reward for his public work.

Theodosius Dobzhansky

Theodosius Dobzhansky, or Theodore Dobzhansky, (24 January 1900 – 18 December 1975) was a noted geneticist and an evolutionary biologist. 

Dobzhansky was born in the Ukraine (then part of Imperial Russia) and emigrated to the United States in 1927. He was a central figure in the field of evolutionary biology for his work on the fruit-fly "Drosophila". He did research on these flies in California, mostly on populations of "Drosophila pseudoobscura". 

Dobzhansky was important in the modern evolutionary synthesis, which was the synthesis of evolutionary biology with genetics.

At school Dobzhansky collected butterflies and beetles, and studued biology at Kiev University. After graduation he moved to St Petersburg (then called Leningrad), and studied under Yuri Filipchenko, who had a "Drosophila" lab. Dobzhansky collected Coccinellidae (ladybird beetles) in the wild, and explored their genetics.

Dobzhansky emigrated to the United States in 1927. He worked with Thomas Hunt Morgan at Columbia University, who had pioneered the use of fruit flies ("Drosophila melanogaster") in genetics experiments. He followed Morgan to the California Institute of Technology from 1930 to 1940. Dobzhansky took fruit fly research out of the laboratory and into the field. He discovered that regional varieties of flies were more similar to each other genetically than to flies from other regions.

In 1937 Dobzhansky published one of the major works of the modern evolutionary synthesis, entitled "Genetics and the Origin of Species". He defined evolution as "a change in the allele frequency within a gene pool". It is through changes in the proportion of alleles in a population that evolution takes place. Also in 1937, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. During this time he had a falling out with one of his "Drosophila" collaborators, Alfred Sturtevant, based perhaps on professional competition. 

Dobzhansky returned to Columbia University from 1940 to 1962. He was one of the signatories of the 1950 UNESCO statement "The Race Question". He then moved to the Rockefeller University) until his retirement in 1971.

<doc id="199827" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199827" title="Julian Huxley">
Julian Huxley

Sir Julian Sorell Huxley FRS (22 June 1887–14 February 1975) was an English evolutionary biologist, humanist and internationalist. He was a proponent of natural selection, and a leading figure in the modern evolutionary synthesis. 

He was Secretary of the Zoological Society of London (1935–1942), the first Director of UNESCO, and a founding member of the World Wildlife Fund.

Huxley came from the distinguished Huxley family. His brother was the writer Aldous Huxley, and his half-brother, a fellow biologist and Nobel laureate, Andrew Huxley; and his paternal grandfather was Thomas Henry Huxley, a friend and supporter of Charles Darwin and proponent of evolution. 

Huxley was well-known for his presentation of science in books and articles, and on radio and television. He was awarded UNESCO's "Kalinga Prize" for the popularisation of science in 1953, the "Darwin Medal" of the Royal Society in 1956, and the "Darwin-Wallace medal" of the Linnean Society in 1958. He was also knighted in that same year, 1958, a hundred years after Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace announced the theory of evolution by natural selection. In 1959 he received a Special Award of the Lasker Foundation in the category Planned Parenthood – World Population. Huxley was a prominent member of the British Eugenics Society.

His particular interest was bird behaviour, especially the courtship of water birds. His observations on the ethology of the Great Crested Grebe, published in 1914, was a landmark in avian field research. His invention of vivid labels for the rituals (such as 'penguin dance', 'plesiosaurus race' etc.) made the ideas memorable and interesting to the general reader.

Huxley was the most important biologist after August Weismann to insist on natural selection as the primary agent in evolution. A fine communicator, he was a prominent populariser of biological science to the public. In the early 20th century he was one of the minority of biologists who believed that natural selection was the main driving force of evolution, and that evolution occurred by small steps and not by jumps. These opinions are now standard. Though his time as an academic was quite brief, he taught and encouraged a number of evolutionary biologists at the University of Oxford in the 1920s.

Huxley was a key figure in the modern evolutionary synthesis. This explained how the discoveries of Gregor Mendel on genetics fitted with Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by means of natural selection. Huxley's 

Huxley's first 'trial run' was the treatment of evolution in the "Science of Life" (1929–30), and in 1936 he published a long and significant paper for the British Association. In 1938 came three lengthy reviews on major evolutionary topics.

Now it was time for Huxley to tackle the subject of evolution at full length, in what became the defining work of his life. His book "" was written whilst he was Secretary to the Zoological Society, and made use of his remarkable collection of reprints covering the first part of the century. It was published in 1942. Reviews of the book in learned journals were little short of ecstatic; the American Naturalist called it "The outstanding evolutionary treatise of the decade, perhaps of the century. The approach is thoroughly scientific; the command of basic information amazing".

Huxley's main co-respondents in the modern evolutionary synthesis are usually listed as Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, George Gaylord Simpson, Bernhard Rensch, Ledyard Stebbins and the population geneticists J.B.S. Haldane, Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright.<br> However, at the time of Huxley's book, several of these had yet to make their distinctive contribution. E.B. Ford and his co-workers in ecological genetics were at least as important.

He always believed that on a broad view evolution led to advances in organisation. "Progress without a goal" was one of his favourite phrases.

In the final chapter of his "Evolution the modern synthesis" he defines evolutionary progress as "a raising of the upper level of biological efficiency, this being defined as increased control over and independence of the environment. "Natural selection plus time produces biological improvement... Improvements in biological machinery... the limbs and teeth of grazing horses... the increase in brain-power... The eyes of a dragon-fly, which can see all round [it] in every direction, are an improvement over the mere microscopic eye-spots of early forms of life". "[Over] the whole range of evolutionary time we see general advance — improvement in all the main properties of life, including its general organization. [But] improvement is not universal. Lower forms manage to survive alongside higher".

Huxley was a prominent member of the British Eugenics Society, and was Vice-President (1937–1944) and President (1959–1962). Huxley was one of many intellectuals at the time who believed that the lowest class in society was genetically inferior. He advocated "the virtual elimination of the few lowest and most degenerate types". In his writing he used this argument several times: "no-one doubts the wisdom of managing the germ-plasm of agricultural stocks, so why not apply the same concept to human stocks?".

In the post-war years, after the realisation that eugenic ideas had become tainted by the Nazis, Huxley (1957) coined the term "transhumanism" to describe the view that man should better himself through science and technology, possibly including eugenics, but also, importantly, the improvement of the social environment.

In response to the rise of European fascism in the 1930s Huxley was asked to write "We Europeans" with three other scientists. Huxley suggested the word 'race' be replaced with ethnic group. After the Second World War he was instrumental in producing the UNESCO statement "The Race Question", which asserted that: 
"A race, from the biological standpoint, may therefore be defined as one of the group of populations constituting the species "Homo sapiens""... "Now what has the scientist to say about the groups of mankind which may be recognized at the present time? Human races can be and have been differently classified by different anthropologists, but at the present time most anthropologists agree on classifying the greater part of present-day mankind into three major divisions, as follows: The Mongoloid Division; The Negroid Division; The Caucasoid Division."... "Catholics, Protestants, Moslems and Jews are not races..."

Reel Big Fish

Reel Big Fish is a ska punk band that started in 1992 in California. They have only ever ska/punk music but moved more to a rock sound during the album "Cheer Up!" They have had many different members since the start of the band, including two different singers and over 10 different horn players. They mainly got successful from the album "Turn The Radio Off", which had the single "Sell Out," in 1997, their most famous song.



A common theme throughout some of their songs (such as "Don't Start A Band" and "Sell Out") is their disapproval of big record companies. Reel Big Fish was signed onto Jive Records, but after their short-lived success, the record company neglected them and did not advertise their albums. In their 2005 album, We're Not Happy Til' You're Not Happy, Reel Big Fish directly and indirectly expresses their anger towards their record company in several of their songs.

During 2006, Reel Big Fish was dropped from Jive Records. The band formed their own label and released a 3-disc live performance CD/DVD set, Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album. This package became available on July 18, 2006 on the Internet and in retail stores on August 22. Jive later released a Reel Big Fish greatest hits album, Greatest Hit...And More, because they owned the rights to all previous songs. The band did not approve of, or make any money from the album, and have spoken out against it.

Cape Tribulation

Cape Tribulation () is both a headland and small town in northern Queensland, Australia north of Cairns. It is in the Daintree National Park and the Wet Tropics World Heritage area. The first people to live in the area were the Kuku Yalanji. The first European to settle in the area was John Moffat in 1880 who set up a farm to grow food for the miners in the west.

There is a sealed road to the area from the south from the Daintree River Ferry. To the north there is a four wheel drive unsealed road, called the Bloomfield Track. This goes to the Bloomfield River, Wujal Wujal, Bloomfield Falls and Cooktown. It is often closed during the wet season (Feb-Apr). 

Tribulation means trouble and great suffering. Cape Tribulation was named by British explorer Lt. James Cook on 10 June 1770 after his ship ran into a coral reef near the headland; "...because here began all our Troubles..."

Cape Tribulation is in a rainforest and it gets a lot of rain. In 2006, the rainfall recorded was over 5.7 metres.

Most people visit the area during the dry season between July and November. There are four main resorts to stay in as well as several smaller bed and breakfast places. The town has two small supermarkets, two ATMs, one takeaway food outlet and five restaurants. During the wet season marine stingers are common so people swim in the many waterholes. There are crocodiles in the creeks.

The Great Barrier Reef is very close to the coast, only due east. There are two boats that take visitors to the reef. Other activities available are guided night walks, 4 wheel drive tours, horseriding, kayaking, jungle surfing, tropical fruit tasting and crocodile cruises.

Sansevieria trifasciata (also known as "Mother-in-law's tongue" or the "snake plant") is a plant that can grow in many places. It is a desert plant from dry Africa. It is a succulent that stores water in its very thick, tough leaves. That means that it does not need to be watered every day. It does not need sunlight to grow and can stay in the same pot for many years. This plant grows better with less water than more water.

Umbrella Tree

Schefflera actinophylla (syn. "Brassaia actinophylla") is a tree in the Araliaceae family. It is native to tropical rainforests and gallery forests in Australia (eastern Queensland and the Northern Territory), New Guinea and Java. Common names include Umbrella Tree, Octopus Tree and Amate.

The elegant schefflera is popular with people who want a big, tree-size plant. In time it will easily reach seven or eight feet; in its home environment in Australia, it gets to be fifty feet tall.

Much of its appeal as a houseplant comes from the unusual leaves. A leaf is composed of a number of leaflets, all set in a circle around a central stem and stretching out horizontally, like the ribs of an umbrella. Eash leaflet is a pointy oval, size to eight inches long, and rich shiny green.

As it gets older, schefflera loses leaves from the lower part of the stem, increasing its tree shape.

The broad leaves tend to collect dust, and this in turn seems to be attractive to red spider mites. To help keep them under control, and to keep your plant looking its best, keep the leave dusted.

This will accommodate itself to our environment reasonable well. It will accept normal household temperatures, and adapts to different humidity levels. With enough sunlight and clean conditions the schefflera will last a long time.

<doc id="199951" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199951" title="Mycorrhiza">
Mycorrhiza

A mycorrhiza (Greek for "fungus roots") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. 

In a mycorrhiza, the fungus lives inside the plant roots, and in the earth. The fungal hyphae are more efficient than plant roots at absorbing nutrients.

Mycorrhizas are important for plant growth in many ecosystems. At least 80% of all land plant species (and over 90% of families) have mycorrhiza. They depend on it for survival. They are the most common symbionts in the plant kingdom: they involve about 6000 species of fungi and 240,000 species of plants.

Mycorrhizas are divided onto two main types: ectomycorrhiza and endomycorrhiza. 
The hyphae of ectomycorrhizal fungi do not penetrate individual cells within the root, while the hyphae of endomycorrhizal fungi penetrate the cell wall and invaginate the cell membrane. 

The mycorrhizal symbiosis is ancient, dating to at least 400 million years ago.

This mutualism gives the fungus sugars, such as glucose and sucrose produced by the plant in photosynthesis. 
The carbohydrates move from their source (usually leaves) to the root and then to the fungal partner. In return, the plant gains the use of the mycelium's very large surface area to absorb water and mineral nutrients from the soil, especially phosphorus.
The mechanisms of increased absorption are both physical and chemical. Mycorrhizal mycelia are much smaller in diameter than the smallest root. They can explore a greater volume of soil, providing a larger surface area for absorption: "It is estimated that every kilogram of soil contains at least 200 km of fungi strands".

Mycorrhizal plants are often more resistant to diseases, such as those caused by microbial soil-borne pathogens, and are also more resistant to the effects of drought. These effects are perhaps due to the improved water and mineral uptake in mycorrhizal plants. 

Mycorrhiza is especially advantageous to the plant in nutrient-poor soils. Plants grown in sterile soils and growth media often perform poorly without the addition of spores or hyphae of mycorrhizal fungi to colonise the plant roots and aid in the uptake of soil mineral nutrients. The absence of mycorrhizal fungi can also slow plant growth in harsh areas.

The fungal partners may also help plant-to-plant transfer of sugars and other nutrients. Such mycorrhizal communities are called "common mycorrhizal networks". 
Some species inhabit the tissues inside roots, stems, and leaves, in which case they are called "endophytes". 
Similar to mycorrhiza, endophytic colonization by fungi may benefit both partners. Endophytes of grasses give their host more resistance to grazers and get food and shelter from the plant in return.

Mycorrhizal roots offer excellent ecological niches for other microbes. Mycorrhizal fungi may host bacteria that complete their life cycles within fungal cells. One of the best known is "Geosiphon pyriforme", which can host cyanobacteria inside characteristic bladders.
Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) fungi are unique in hosting bacteria in their cytoplasm. Intracellular structures very similar to bacteria were first described in the 1970s. Research later identified them as true bacteria.

William Whewell (24 May 1794 – 6 March 1866) was an English polymath, Anglican priest, philosopher, theologian, and historian of science. He influenced the great scientists of his day: John Herschel, Charles Darwin, Charles Lyell and Michael Faraday. He invented many terms we use today, such as "scientist" (in 1837).

The son of a carpenter, Whewell rose to the top. For 28 years he was a Professor, and for 25 years he was Master of Trinity College, Cambridge University. He was one of the founding members and a president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, a Fellow of the Royal Society, and President of the Geological Society. It was the Prime Minister himself, Robert Peel, who recommended his appointment as Master of Trinity.

Whewell had wide interests. He researched ocean tides (for which he won the Royal Medal). He published work in mechanics, physics, geology, astronomy, and economics. He composed poetry, wrote books, translated the works of Goethe, and wrote sermons and theological tracts.

Whewell's five volumes of the "History and Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences" are his major work. Science was then still a novel activity. The scientists themselves held differing views as to how best to go about their work. Whewell provided a theoretical framework, and the framework provoked a great deal of debate. There was also a long-running discussion with John Stuart Mill about social and economic philosophy.

Mandello del Lario is a town on the oriental bank of the Lake of Lecco and Como, that is called Lario (210 ms.). The territory is sheltered from a spectacular mountain, called Grigna (2,410 ms.) very famous for who has interested about climbs. As many famous the southern peak, smaller, called Grignetta (2.177 ms.). The Mandello del Lario’s river, called Meria, that crosses the town, it has been very important for the manufacturing development of the '800 as power. A part of the water of the river has been canalized with a clever system of "chiuse". Still these canalizations, in partly divert and bury, the water regularly flows, but without more its native functions. It is interesting to visit the various stations of closing however, as the ancient "lavatoi" which have been maintained, places where at the beginning of last century the women went to wash the cloths and they are now to memory of the time that was. 
Mandello del Lario is from 60 km from Milan, the capital of the Lombardy, one of the greatest and productive regions in Italy of the North, but also in Europe.
The first known installations of Mandello of the Lario, that it originally called alone Mandello, go up again to halves the first millennium, and, for its strategic position, it has been one of the fortresses of Federico Barbarossa, lived to horse of the XII century. 
Now Mandello del Lario, with his around 10,000 of people, it is the greatest city on the lake Lario after the cities of Como and of Lecco. Also people, who are interested of motorcycles or not, it know Mandello del Lario about where the mythical Motorbikes Moto Guzzi born.
The best period to visit Mandello del Lario is the spring to cross his suggestive and perfumed paths that go up again on the Grigna, the summer to enjoy themselves the aquatic sports and the enchanting evening walks on the lake, the autumn to remain spellbound from the thousand colours of the variegated vegetation and to feel the pleasant experience to go to pick up the chestnuts in the vast woods to the slopes of the mountain, the winter to feel the warmth emanated by the lake despite the peaks with the snow and to practise the winter sports in the near Valtellina. In short, all period of the year is good to stay few weeks to Mandello del Lario. 
In more, Mandello del Lario is connected away train with Milan (around 50 minutes, with runs every hours) and with Valtellina, so you will not absolutely need the auto for the local moves.

<doc id="200051" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=200051" title="Trampoline">
Trampoline

A trampoline is a recreational or competitive device designed to allow users to bounce on. It normally consists of a metal frame (rectangular or circular in shape) supporting a flat jumping surface connected to the frame by springs. The jumping surface may be of a strong synthetic fabric material or, mostly, of a mesh design. Trampolines allow users to bounce higher by storing energy in the springs as they land on the surface which then accelerates the user back away from the jumping surface as the springs contract.

The first modern trampoline was invented by George Nissen in 1920-1922 as a kind of equipment for gymnastics .

During World War II, the United States Navy Flight School developed the use of the trampoline in its training of pilots and navigators, giving them concentrated practice in spatial orientation that had not been possible before. After the war, the development of the space flight program again brought the trampoline into use to help train both American and Soviet astronauts, giving them experience of variable body positions in flight.

Lord Mandelson, Peter Benjamin Mandelson, (born 21 October 1953) is a British politician for the Labour Party. He helped to found the so-called 'New Labour' with Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He was the MP for Hartlepool.

He lost his job twice, once in 1998 for not declaring a loan he was given to buy a house, and once in 2001 for trying to arrange a passport for an Indian businessman who had given £1,000,000 to the Labour party. He later made a speech claiming to have "inner steel".

Since Gordon Brown became Prime Minister, he made Mandelson a Life Peer, and some newspapers have called him "the most powerful man in the Labour party".

Peter Mandelson is gay (he was outed in 1998 by Matthew Parris), which led some to claim the UK was being run by a gay mafia.

The St. Bernard is a very large breed of dog. It was originally bred as a working dog, to rescue people who were lost in the Swiss Alps.

It is a very big dog with a big head. A full grown male can weigh between 160 and 260 lb. The largest dog ever was a St. Bernard called Benedictine who weighed 357lbs.

Tommy Vercetti

Tommy Vercetti is the main playable character of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.

Prior to events in Vice City, Tommy had previously worked as a member of the Forelli family of the Liberty City Mafia. In 1971, he was sent by Sonny Forelli to kill a man in the Harwood District, but as he arrived 11 men ambushed him. Tommy was forced to kill them all, resulting in a 15-year prison sentence for multiple counts of murder. He also earned the title "Harwood Butcher".

Fresh out of prison in 1986, Tommy is keen to start work again for the Forelli family, and is immediately dispatched by Don Sonny Forelli to Vice City to participate in a crucial introductory drug deal. When an ambush of the deal by a group of masked attackers results in Tommy losing both the money and the drugs, he sets out to find and kill the party responsible. In doing so, he takes complete control of the city, becoming one of Vice City's richest and most powerful men and becoming the leader of the extremely powerful Vercetti Gang. Sonny Forelli, however, continually demands his cut of the substantial profits, leading him to confront Tommy in person. After it emerges that Tommy's original 1971 capture was orchestrated by Sonny himself, Tommy kills Sonny and countless Forelli family members in his mansion, and emerges triumphant as the leader of an organization in total domination of Vice City. He used his power to kill a couple of the people he worked for, such as Ricardo Diaz. Tommy also had a business relationship with other gangs such as the Cubans, the Haitians, and big Mitch Baker's Bikers.

Tommy Vercetti was voiced by Ray Liotta.

This template uses the decimal code for the apostrophe or single-quote character so that it doesn't become interpreted with adjacent italics (codice_1) or bold (codice_2) wiki markup. This situation most commonly arises when taking the possessive of titles that . codice_3 is shorter than codice_4 and clearer than an unadorned codice_5.

This template is similar to , except that it leaves leading space before the apostrophe. This template is intended for use with "italic" text, whereas is intended for use with non-italic text. For example:
generates:
with a tiny amount of space before the apostrophe to avoid colliding with the italic "d" at the end of "Iliad". Conversely, should be used if the text is already italicized. For example:
generates:
without the extra space, which would be distracting here.

Joseph Dalton Hooker

Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker OM GCSI CB MD FRS (30 June 1817 – 10 December 1911) was a British botanist and explorer of the 19th century. Hooker was one of the founders of geographical botany, and Charles Darwin's closest friend. He was Director of the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, for twenty years, in succession to his father, William Jackson Hooker, and was awarded the highest honours of British science.

The expedition consisted of two ships, HMS "Erebus" and HMS "Terror"; it was the last major voyage of exploration made entirely under sail. Hooker was the youngest of the 128 man crew. He sailed on the "Erebus" and was assistant to the ship's surgeon, who was instructed to collect zoological and geological specimens. The ships travelled all over the southern oceans from South America to Australia and New Zealand. Hooker made plant collections at each location and while travelling drew these and specimens of algae and sea life pulled aboard using tow nets.

After spending 5 months in the Antarctic they returned to resupply in Hobart, then went on to Sydney, and New Zealand. They left New Zealand to return to Antarctica. After spending 138 days at sea, and a collision between the "Erebus" and "Terror," they sailed to the Falkland Islands, to Tierra del Fuego, back to the Falklands and onward to their third sortie into the Antarctic. The ships arrived back in England on 4 September 1843; the voyage had been a success for Ross as it was the first to confirm the existence of the southern continent and chart much of its coastline.

On 11 November 1847 Hooker left England for his three year long Himalayan expedition; he would be the first European to collect plants in the Himalayas. Hooker's expedition was based in Darjeeling. Hooker wrote to Darwin relaying to him the habits of animals in India, and collected plants in Bengal.

Hooker and a sizable party of local assistants departed for eastern Nepal on 27 October 1848. They travelled north west along Nepal's passes into Tibet. In April 1849 he started on a longer expedition into Sikkim, but he was imprisoned by the Dewan of Sikkim when they were travelling towards Tibet. A British team was sent to negotiate: they were released without bloodshed. Hooker returned to Darjeeling where he spent January and February 1850 writing his journals, replacing specimens lost during his detention and planning a journey for his last year in India.

Hooker's survey of hitherto unexplored regions, the "Himalayan Journals" was published in 1854.

This trip was taken in the autumn of 1860, with Daniel Hanbury. They visited and collected in Syria and Palestine; no full-length report was published, but a number of papers were written. Hooker recognised three phytogeograpical divisions: Western Syria and Palestine; Eastern Syria and Palestine; Middle and Upper mountain regions of Syria.

Hooker visited Morocco from April to June 1871, in the company of John Ball, George Maw and a young gardener from Kew, called Crump.

This was undertaken with his friend Asa Gray, the leading American botanist of the day. "A difficult question was why in the great mountain chains of the Western United States there appeared to be only a few botanical enclaves of plants of eastern-Asiatic afinities among plants of Mexican and more southern types." Hooker was back in Kew with 1,000 dried specimens by October.

Some idea of the delights he encountered (trivia from his journal & letters):



His views on the flora of Colorado and Utah: There are two temperate, and two cold or mountain floras, viz: 1. a prairie flora derived from the eastward; 2. a so-called desert and saline flora derived from the west; 3. a sub-alpine; 4. an alpine flora, the two latter of widely different origin, and in one sense proper to the Rocky Mountain ranges.

While on the "Erebus", Hooker had read proofs of Charles Darwin's "Voyage of the Beagle" provided by Charles Lyell and had been very impressed by Darwin's skill as a naturalist. They had met once, before the Antarctic voyage started. After Hooker's return to England, he was approached by Darwin who invited him to classify the plants that Darwin had collected in South America and the Galápagos Islands. Hooker agreed and the pair began a life-long friendship. On 11 January 1844 Darwin mentioned to Hooker his early ideas on the evolution and natural selection, and Hooker showed interest.. In 1847 he agreed to read Darwin's "Essay" explaining the theory, and responded with notes giving Darwin calm critical feedback. Their correspondence continued throughout the development of Darwin's theory and in 1858 Darwin wrote that Hooker was "the one living soul from whom I have constantly received sympathy".

Richard Freeman wrote: "Hooker was Charles Darwin's greatest friend and confidant". Certainly they had extensive correspondence, and they also met face-to-face (Hooker visiting Darwin). Hooker and Lyell were the two people Darwin consulted (by letter) when Wallace's famous letter arrived at Down House, enclosing his paper on natural selection. Hooker was instrumental in creating the device whereby the Wallace paper was accompanied by Darwin's notes and his letter to Asa Gray (showing his prior realization of natural selection) in a presentation to the Linnean Society. Hooker was the one who formally presented this material to the Linnean Society meeting in 1858. In 1859 the author of "The Origin of Species" recorded his indebtedness to Hooker's wide knowledge and balanced judgment.

In December 1859, Hooker published the "Introductory Essay to the Flora Tasmaniae", the final part of the Botany of the Antarctic Voyage. It was in this essay (which appeared just one month after the publication of Charles Darwin's "On the Origin of Species"), that Hooker announced his support for the theory of evolution by natural selection, thus becoming the first recognised man of science to publicly back Darwin.

At the historic debate on evolution held at the Oxford on 30 June 1860, Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, Benjamin Brodie and Robert FitzRoy spoke against Darwin's theory, and Hooker and Thomas Henry Huxley defended it. According to Hooker's own account, it was he and not Huxley who delivered the most effective reply to Wilberforce's arguments. 

Hooker acted as president of the British Association at its Norwich meeting of 1868, when his address was remarkable for its championship of Darwinian theories. Hooker was a close friend of Thomas Henry Huxley, a member of the X-Club (which dominated the Royal Society in the 1870s and early 1880s), and the first of the three X-Clubbers in succession to become President of the Royal Society.

By his travels and his publications, Hooker built up a high scientific reputation at home. In 1855 he was appointed Assistant-Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and in 1865 he succeeded his father as Director, holding the post for twenty years. Under the Hookers, the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew rose to world renown. At the age of thirty, Hooker was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1873 he was chosen as its President (until 1877). He received three of its medals: the Royal Medal in 1854, the Copley Medal in 1887 and the Darwin Medal in 1892. He continued to intersperse work at Kew with foreign exploration and collecting. His journeys to Palestine, Morocco and the United States all produced valuable information and specimens for Kew.

Ballets Russes

The Ballets Russes were a company of ballet dancers whose full title was "Les Ballets Russes de Serge Diaghilev". They became extremely famous in Europe in the early part of the 20th century. 

The group was formed and directed by the Russian Sergei Diaghilev. The Ballets Russes had more influence on ballet and ballet music than any other ballet company of their time. The dancers were from Russia, but the group travelled throughout Europe, spending a lot of their time based in Paris. Stravinsky was one of the many composers who wrote ballet music for them.

Sergei Diaghilev was an impresario who was extremely good at spotting good dancers and helping them to rise to great standards. He had very good taste in art and music and inspired some great composers to write music for his dancers. He got some of the most famous painters of his time to make set designs for his productions.

The group was started in 1909. By 1911 they had become a group who toured regularly. Many of the dancers had come from the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg. They adapted the productions from the Mariinsky Theatre, performing ballets such as "Prince Igor", "Cleopatra" and "Le Festin" and "Les Sylphides".

During the World War I they were cut off from any contact with Russia. During these years they experimented with many new ideas. Productions such as "Les Biches" and "Le Train Bleu" were about the fashionable society around them. At the same time the company also had productions which reflected Russian folklore, Greek legends and the Orient.

Their fame continued after the war. 

When Diaghilev died suddenly in 1929 the Ballets Russes broke up and the dancers moved to other companies. Some of them formed the "Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo", who travelled to America and influenced dancing there.

The company worked with several very famous choreographers such as Marius Petipa, Michel Fokine, Vaslav Nijinsky, Leonide Massine, and the young George Balanchine. Nijinsky’s dances reflect the art movement called Expressionism. Many of his new ideas could be seen in L'Apres-midi d'un Faune and The Rite of Spring.

The Ballets Russes had many famous dancers. Many of them were from the Russian Imperial Theatres and they came to dance for Ballets Russes during the summer months. Some of the great dancers include Anna Pavlova, Tamara Karsavina, Olga Spessivtzeva, Mathilde Kschessinska, Ida Rubinstein, Bronislava Nijinska, Lydia Lopokova and Alicia Markova.

The company was particularly influential because they treated male dancers as important. Up until this time the female dancers had much more attention than the male dancers. Among the male dancers were Michel Fokine, Serge Lifar, Léonide Massine, George Balanchine, Adolphe Bolm, and, especially, Vaslav Nijinsky who became the greatest dancer of his time.

The most famous music composed for Ballets Russes was that by the composer Igor Stravinsky. His ballets include The Firebird, Petrouchka, The Rite of Spring, Les Noces and Apollon musagète. The first time that The Rite of Spring was performed many in the audience hated it and booed and started to fight. Others thought it was brilliant. Stravinsky's music was original and shocking, and Nijinsky's choreography went beyond classical ballet technique. The audience found it difficult to understand the music and dance. They were used to the romantic music and classical ballet of the nineteenth century.

Diaghilev also used music which had already been composed. This included music by Debussy, Ravel, Darius Milhaud, Prokofiev and other famous composers of the time.

The artists and designers who worked for the ballet included some of the 20th century's most famous names. Picasso, Bakst, Braque, Matisse, Coco Chanel, Miró, Dali, and Utrillo were some of the best-known.

Rest mass

Rest mass (physics), the mass of a body as measured when the body is at rest, but it is relative to an observer who is moving or not, an inherent property of the body. All matter, such as any object, has some rest mass. Energy, such as light or kinetic energy (the energy of a moving object) has no rest mass because it causes no change in spacetime in a frozen time frame. However, energy affects mass while time passes; therefore, it affects spacetime, so it has mass.

Sergei Diaghilev

Sergei Pavlovich Diaghilev (also known as Serge), (Russia, 31 March 1872 – 19 August 1929) was a Russian art critic, patron and ballet impresario. He formed a ballet company called "Les Ballets Russes de Serge Diaghilev". Many think it was the greatest ballet company of all time.

For twenty years, between 1909 and 1929, they were the most famous ballet company in the world. Many of their ideas influenced art and music as well as dance. Diaghilev got some of the world's greatest painters to design sets for his productions, and some great composers, including Igor Stravinsky, to compose music for the ballets.

His dancers included the legendary Nijinsky and the Imperial prima ballerina Karsavina; also Pavlova, Danilova and Spessivtseva. His choreographers included Fokine, Nijinska, Massine and Balanchine; his composers included Stravinsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Prokofiev, Ravel and Debussy; his set designers included Picasso, Cezanne, Matisse, Utrillo, Bakst and Braque; Cocteau worked as an artist and wrote scenarios. The ballets created and the performances changed the course of ballet history.

Diaghilev's gift lay in spotting talent, and bringing great artists to work together. He also persuaded patrons to support the Ballets Russes. The production costs were enormous, and were not always covered by the ticket prices. The repertoire (list) of new ballets and new music grew, and the productions were not always successful. Diaghilev's company folded soon after his death, though many of the group worked together in new companies.

<doc id="200564" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=200564" title="Santiago de los Caballeros">
Santiago de los Caballeros

Santiago de los Caballeros, or Santiago for short, is a Dominican city and the head municipality of the Santiago, in the north central region of the country. By its population and economic activity, it is the second most important city in the country, after Santo Domingo.

The people from this city are called (demonym) different ways; "santiaguero" for males and "santiaguera" for females. Sometimes "santiagués" is used for both sexes. "Santiaguense" (for both sexes) is used to differentiate them from people of other cities with the same name in Spain, Cuba, Chile, and Argentina).

The municipality has the municipalities of Tamboril and Licey al Medio to the east, the La Vega province to the southeast, the municipality of Jánico to the south, the municipality of San José de las Matas to the southwest, the Valverde province to the west, the municipalities of Villa Bisonó and Villa González to the northwest and the province of Puerto Plata to the north.

It has an area of 524.03 km². There are five municipal districts in the municipality (municipal districts in the Dominican Republic are similar to municipalities but they depend on a municipality). Those municipal districts are:

The "Cordillera Septentrional" (in English, "Northern mountain range") runs along the northern half of the municipality. The city of Santiago de los Caballeros is on the southern side of those mountains, and even some parts of the city are on the mountains.
There are several small hills in the city; the highest is the "Cerro del Castillo" (in English, "Castle Hill") in the eastern part of the city; on this hill there is a monument: the "Monumento a los Héroes de la Restauración" (in English, "Monument to the Restoration War Heroes"), commonly named only as the "Monumento".

The river "Yaque del Norte", the longest of the Dominican Republic, flows along the old southern side of the city. Now, the city is on both sides of the river but most people still lives on the northern (right) side of it. Other rivers are Nibaje and Gurabito but they are very small and tributaries of the Yaque del Norte.

The city of Santiago de los Caballeros is located in the northeastern part of the "Yaque del Norte Valley", a very dry and hot region. And so, the climate of the city is a dry tropical climate, hot most of the year (mean temperature of 26.2 °C). The northern part of the municipality, and part of the city, is on the Cordillera Central mountain range and the climate is cooler and it rains more than in the city itself.

The municipality had, in 2002, a total population of 690,534: 338,120 men and 352,414 women. The urban population was 75.2% of the total population. In this numbers are included the population of all its municipal districts.

Without the population of the municipal districts, the total population of Santiago in 2002 was 553,091. For the year 2008, the population was estimated to be 673,329.

Christopher Columbus built a small fort in the summer of 1495, on the northern side of the river Yaque del Norte in a place named "La Emboscada". This is several kilometres to the west of the present city. Columbus named the fort after "Santiago Apóstol", in English "Saint James"

In 1504, Nicolás de Ovando, governor of the Hispaniola, moved the town to Jacagua which is now the modern municipality of San Francisco de Jacagua. This place was near the mountains and away from the river Yaque del Norte.

An earthquake destroyed the city of Santiago on 2 December 1562. The next year, 1563, the city was rebuilt again on the north side of the river Yaque del Norte but this time more to the east, where it is now. This new town was called "Santiago de los Caballeros", in English, "Saint James of the Knights" or, better, "Knights of Saint James".

Even if farming is still a very important economic activity around the city, Santiago is now a modern city with many industries and companies of different kinds.

Santiago is home of two universities: "Pontificia Universidad Católica Madre y Maestra" (PUCMM) and "Universidad Tecnológica de Santiago" (UTESA). Other universities present in Santiago are: "Universidad Organización & Método" (O&M), "Universidad Abierta para Adultos" (UAPA), "Universidad Nacional Evangélica" and one regional campus of the state university "Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo" (UASD).

The twin cities of Santiago are:

Sylvia Plath

Sylvia Plath (October 27, 1932 – February 11, 1963) was an American writer. She was most well-known for her poetry, but she also wrote novels, children's books, and short stories. Her most well-known novel is "The Bell Jar", which was partly based on her life. She married another famous poet, Ted Hughes. She suffered from depression and killed herself in 1963.

Plath was born in 1932 in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. Her parents were called Otto Emile Plath and Aurelia Schober Plath. Her father, Otto, was from Germany. He was a college professor and wrote a book about bumblebees. Aurelia Plath was ten years younger than her husband. In April 1935, Plath's younger brother Warren was born. The family moved to Winthrop, Massachusetts in 1936. This was where Aurelia had grown up. Plath published her first poem here, when she was eight. It was in the children's section of a newspaper called the "Boston Herald".

In 1940, Otto Plath died. He was buried in Winthrop cemetery. In 1942, Aurelia and the children moved to Wellesley, Massachusetts.

Plath went to Smith College. After her third year, she became a guest editor for a magazine called "Mademoiselle", and spent a month in New York City. At this time, she became depressed. She tried to kill herself by taking too many sleeping pills. After she took the pills, she crawled underneath her house, but she was found and taken to hospital. She went to a mental hospital called McLean Hospital and was treated for her depression. She was given a treatment called electric shock therapy. She began to improve and was able to graduate from Smith College in 1955.

Plath then went to the University of Cambridge in England, on a scholarship called the Fulbright scholarship. She attended Newnham College, Cambridge and carried on writing poetry. She also wrote for the student newspaper at Cambridge. At a party she met an English poet called Ted Hughes. She married him on June 16, 1956.

After they were married, Plath and Hughes went to live in the United States. Plath taught at her old college, Smith College. They met and became friends with a poet named W. S. Merwin. Plath found out that she was pregnant. They moved back to England. They lived in London for a while, and then in a small town in Devon called North Tawton. Plath published her first collection of poems. It was called "The Colossus". In February 1961 she had a miscarriage. She wrote about her miscarriage in some of her poems.

Plath and Hughes' marriage was unhappy. Hughes had an affair with a woman called Assia Wevill. Plath and Hughes separated (lived apart) in 1962. Plath moved to London with their children, Frieda and Nicholas.

In 1963, Plath committed suicide. She sealed the room she was in with wet towels, turned the gas oven on and put her head inside the oven. She died because she was poisoned by carbon monoxide gas. Some people think that she did not mean to kill herself. Her body was buried in a small village in West Yorkshire called Heptonstall.

Napoleon II of France

Napoléon François Joseph Charles Bonaparte, Duke of Reichstadt (1811 – 1832), was the son of Napoleon Bonaparte and his second wife, Marie Louise of Austria. When he was born, he was called the King of Rome. His father said this was a polite way of reminding everyone that his son was going to be his successor.

Napoléon II was born in Paris in 1811. Three years later, the First French Empire collapsed. Napoleon wanted to resign as Emperor and let his young son take over, but Emperor Alexander I of Russia disagreed. Napoléon II was taken by his mother to Château de Blois in April 1814.

After Napoleon I's defeat at Waterloo in 1815, Napoleon II convinced his father to resign. Napoleon I then declared his son "Emperor of the French" but this was not official because the Bourbon Restoration was proclaimed immediately after the abdication of Napoleon I.

After 1815, the young prince, known as "Franz" (after his maternal grandfather, Emperor Francis of Austria), lived in Austria. He was awarded the title of Duke of Reichstadt in 1818.

He was very close to Princess Sophie of Bavaria and it has been said that he was the father of her son, the future ill-fated Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. This idea has not found acceptance. 

Napoléon II died of tuberculosis at Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna on 22 July 1832. It was said that Sophie never recovered after his death and that she blamed it on Metternich for the rest of her life.

On 15 December, 1940, his remains were moved from Vienna to the dome of Les Invalides in Paris. This a "gift" to France by the German dictator Adolf Hitler. Coming from Hitler, this "gift" was not appreciated by the French people. The remains of Napoleon I had been moved there on 15 December 1840. For some time, the young prince was buried beside his father. Later his remains were moved again into the lower church. While most of his remains are in Paris, his heart and intestines are still in Vienna. The heart is in Urn 42 in the "Heart Crypt" (Herzgruft) and his intestines are in Urn 76 of the Ducal Crypt.

Bonapartists referred to him as the King of Rome and as Napoleon II. Although this latter designation had (and still has) no official status, the next Napoleon to come to the throne of France took the name Napoleon III in deference to him. He was also known as "L'Aiglon", or "The Eaglet". Edmond Rostand wrote a play, L'Aiglon about his life.

Maximilian I of Mexico

Maximilian I of Mexico (1832 – 1867) was a member of the Imperial House of Habsburg-Lorraine. 
After a distinguished career in the Austrian Navy he was proclaimed Emperor of Mexico, during the Second Mexican Empire. Many Europeans, and Viennese in particular, suspected that he was actually fathered by Napoleon II of France, also known as the Duke of Reichstadt). Those who believe this talk about the unnaturally close relationship that existed between Sophie and Napoleon II. It was said that Sophie never recovered after his death and that she blamed it on Metternich for the rest of her life and that, from birth, Maximilian's stature resembled Napoleon II's more than that of Franz Karl, his older brother, or any of his younger brothers. He ruled as the Emperor of Mexico from 1864 to 1867. He was installed by occupying French forces under Napoleon III. When the French left in 1867, Maximilian refused to go with them, believing he had the support of the people. He was captured by Benito Juarez’s Republican forces and executed by firing squad on June 19, 1867.

<doc id="200628" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=200628" title="Initiation">
Initiation

Initiation is a ceremony at the entrance or acceptance into a group or society. It can also be a formal admission to adulthood in a community.
Examples of initiation ceremonies are Christian baptism or confirmation, Jewish bar or bat mitzvah, acceptance into a fraternal organization like the freemasons or religious order like the Benedictines, or graduation from school. A person taking the initiation ceremony is called an "initiate".

The English word comes from the Latin, "initium": "entrance" or "beginning. The related English verb, initiate, means to begin or start a particular action.

Tribes often have initiations. In many African tribes, initiation means circumcision of males and sometimes circumcision/genital mutilation of females as well. Initiation is thought to be necessary for the individual to be regarded as a full member of the tribe. Otherwise, the individual may not be allowed to take part in ceremonies or even in social ritual such as marriage. A man will not be allowed to marry or have any special relationship with a woman who didn't go to an initiation, because she is not considered as a woman.

Initiation may be thought of as an event which may help teens prepare themselves to be good husbands and wives. Because of modernization initiation is not taken so seriously as before, but there are still certain areas which still perform initiations.

In some African tribes, boys have initiation rites for 3–4 months and girls for 1–2 months.

Australian Aboriginal tribes usually had long periods of time to help prepare adolescent boys, teaching them the Law before they were ready to attend large elaborate ceremonies at the time of initiation when they were finally recognized as men in their society. Most tribes had circumcision and scarification as part of the male initiation rituals, while many Central Australian tribes also practiced subincision.

Bar and Bat Mitzvah

In Judaism, a Bar Mitzvah is a Jewish boy, and a Bat Mitzvah a Jewish girl, who has turned 13 years old (or for a girl in the Orthodox movement, 12 years old), and who has gone through a ceremony that represents acceptance of some responsibilities which symbolizes their coming of age. The terms are also used for the ceremony celebrating this event. 


According to Jewish law, when Jewish children reach the age of majority (generally thirteen years for boys and twelve for girls) they become responsible for their actions, and "become a Bar or Bat Mitzvah". This is also the time when physical puberty normally begins. Before this the child's parents have the responsibility that the child follows Jewish law and tradition and, after this age, children have their own responsibility for Jewish ritual law, tradition, and ethics and have the right to take part in all areas of Jewish community life.

Joseph Bonaparte

Joseph-Napoléon Bonaparte was an elder brother of Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1806, he crowned him as King of Naples and Sicily and later King of Spain in 1808. 

He was born Giuseppe Buonaparte to Carlo Buonaparte, representative to King Louis XVI's court. He was educated in Corsica and France and studied law at Pisa. In the Corsican civil war, which marked the early years of the French Revolution, he sided with the French, as did his brother Napoleon. When the anti-French forces were victorious, he and the entire Bonaparte family fled to the Continent.As a lawyer, politician, and diplomat, he served in the Cinq-Cents and was the French ambassador to Rome.In 1795 Joseph was a member of the Council of Ancients where he used his position to help his brother overthrow the Directory.

In 1806, Joseph Bonaparte was given military command of Naples, and shortly afterward was made king by Napoleon I, to be replaced after two years by his sister's husband, Joachim Murat, when Joseph was made king of Spain in August 1808, soon after the French invasion.

Joseph Bonaparte reluctantly left Naples and arrived in Spain just in time for the Spanish revolt against French rule, and the beginning of the Peninsular War, in which the French were eventually expelled by Spanish guerilla fighters and by an Anglo-Portuguese army. The Spanish remain loyal to their former king, Ferdinand VII.Bonaparte abdicated and returned to France after defeat at the Battle of Vitoria. He was seen by Bonapartists (supporters of Napoleon I) as the rightful Emperor of the French after the death of Napoleon's own son Napoleon II in 1832.

As the eldest in the family Bonaparte, he became the its head in 1832, although he did little to advance his claim. Joseph Bonaparte lived primarily in the United States from 1817 to 1832, initially in New York City and Philadelphia. He was also reputed to have encountered the Jersey Devil while hunting there.Bonaparte returned to Europe, where he died in Florence, Italy and was buried in the Les Invalides building complex in Paris. He was succeeded by his younger brother Louis Bonaparte as Head of their family.

Swing vote

Swing voters are people who vote who do not always vote for the same party. Their vote is called a swing vote.

The swing vote is often closely studied when there are elections because it often decides who wins the election. In many elections parties try to convince the swing voters and the people who vote for the first time to vote for them. In contrast to the swing voters, there are other voters who have always voted for the same party in the past. A campaign for a vote therefore often focuses less on keeping the people who will always vote for their party; the parties spend more effort and money on convincing new people to vote for them.

Volgograd

Volgograd formerly called Tsaritsyn (1589–1925) and Stalingrad (1925–1961) is an important industrial city and the administrative center of Volgograd Oblast, Russia. It is 80 km long, north to south, on the western bank of the Volga River and has a population of 1.011 millon people. The city was made famous for its heroic resistance and extensive damage during the Battle of Stalingrad during World War II.

Volgograd developed from 1589 when the fortress of Tsaritsyn was founded at the confluence of the Tsaritsa and Volga Rivers. 
During the Russian Civil War the city was the scene of heavy fighting. Bolshevik forces occupied it during 1918, but were attacked by White forces.

Under Stalin, the city became heavily industrialized as a centre of heavy industry and trans-shipment by rail and river. During World War II, Stalingrad became the center of the Battle of Stalingrad as well as a turning point in the war against Germany. Essentially, the German offensive was checked at Stalingrad. The Battle of Stalingrad lasted from August 21, 1942 to February 2, 1943, where 1.7 million to 2 million Axis and Soviet soldiers were killed, wounded or captured, in addition to over 40,000 civilians killed. The city was reduced to rubble during the fierce fighting, but reconstruction began soon after the Germans were expelled from the city.

As of 2008, Volgograd has 21 sister cities:
A number of communities in France and Italy have streets or avenues named after Stalingrad, hence "Place de Stalingrad" in Paris and the Paris Métro station of Stalingrad.

<doc id="200698" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=200698" title="Problem of evil">
Problem of evil

The problem of evil is the question whether evil exists, and if so does it disprove the existence of God. Certain religions say there is a god who is all-loving, all-knowing and all-powerful. In these religions, the question to answer is how an all-loving and all-powerful god could allow evil to exist. 

Responses include the argument that if there is free will, evil must necessarily exist; that humans cannot understand God; that evil is simply being without god; or that there is evil because the world is corrupted and fallen (from grace). 

A version of the problem of evil, perhaps by Epicurus, goes as follows: 

Another argument goes: 

Arguments such as these are about the "logical" problem of evil. They attempt to show that the assumed propositions lead to a logical contradiction and cannot therefore all be correct. 

A common response is that God can exist with and allow evil in order to achieve a greater good. Some philosophers accept that arguments such as "God allows evil in order to achieve the greater good of free will" are logically possible and thus solve the logical problem of evil. Since the aim is only to defeat the assertion that God and evil are "logically incompatible", even a highly implausible instance of God's coexistence with evil is sufficient for the purpose.

Philosophies of science have approached the problem from the angle of empiricism. For logical positivism the issue with God is the lack of any independent method of verification. In their view, this makes the proposition "God exists", not true or false, but meaningless. A similar position points to the lack of any way the proposition might be falsified.

Argument from inconsistent revelations

The Argument from inconsistent revelations (also known as Avoiding the wrong hell problem) is an argument that says that God probably does not exist. There are many religions which are based on revelations. The problem with these revelations is that they contradict each other. A person must either accept or reject at least one of these revelations in order to be part of a religious group. That way, accepting one means rejecting some (if not all) of the others. Unless the revelation is personal, the follower must to some extent rely on the judgment or the stories of others. Assuming the revelation is personal, the follower is still ignoring the revelations of those before him.

Christians believe that Jesus is the savior of the world and the son of God; Jews believe just as strongly that he is not. Similarly, Muslims believe that the Qur'an was divinely authored, while Jews and Christians do not. There are many examples of such contrasting views. Positions where one religion contradicts another, or where one group of people contradicts another are common. There are many denominations in Christianity who do not agree about many things.

Deadlock

A deadlock is a situation wherein two or more competing actions are waiting for the other to finish. As a consequence, neither ever does. It is often seen in a paradox like the "chicken or the egg."

In computer science, deadlock refers to a specific condition when two or more processes are each waiting for each other to release a resource. It can also be that more than two processes are waiting for a number of resources. Deadlock is a common problem in multiprocessing where many processes share a specific type of mutually exclusive resource known as a "software lock" or "soft lock". Computers intended for the "time-sharing" or "real-time" markets are often equipped with a "hardware lock" (or "hard lock") which guarantees "exclusive access" to processes. This forces the prforcing serialized access. Deadlocks are particularly troubling because there is no "general" solution to avoid (soft) deadlocks.

This situation may be likened to two people who are drawing diagrams, with only one pencil and one ruler between them. If one person takes the pencil and the other takes the ruler, a deadlock occurs when the person with the pencil needs the ruler and the person with the ruler needs the pencil to finish his work with the ruler. Both requests can't be satisfied, so a deadlock occurs.

The telecommunications description of deadlock is a little stronger: deadlock occurs when none of the processes meet the condition to move to another state (as described in the process's finite state machine) "and" all the communication channels are empty. The second condition is often left out on other systems but is important in the telecommunication context.

False analogy

A False analogy is an informal fallacy. It apples to inductive arguments. It is an "informal" fallacy because the error is about what the argument is about, and not the argument itself.

An analogy proposes that two concepts which arer similar (A and B) have a common relationship to some property. A has property X, therefore B must also have property X. In a false analogy, the objects may have some similarities, but they do not both have property X. That way, both objects may have the same color, but this does not mean that they have the same size. Even if bananas and the sun appear yellow, one could not conclude that they are the same size. One who makes an invalid analogy or comparison is often said to be "comparing apples and oranges".

The following are examples of false analogies:

Lord Berners

Lord Berners, whose full name was Gerald Hugh Tyrwhitt-Wilson, 14th Baron Berners, (born Apley Hall, Shropshire, 18 September 1883; died Faringdon House, Berkshire, 19 April 1950), was a British composer of classical music, novelist and painter. He is usually called Lord Berners. He was an amateur composer who is remembered for his strange, eccentric behaviour.

Berners was born in Apley Hall, Bridgnorth in the west of England. The Berners family were related to King Edward III of England. His father was a naval officer who was not often at home. He was looked after by his mother and grandmother who was very religious and very strict. Berners was very interested in lots of things, especially music, but his mother did nothing to help him.

At first he went to boarding school in Cheam. Then he went to Eton. He taught himself to compose. He became a diplomat and travelled to Rome and Constantinople. In 1919, when his uncle died, he became 14th Baron Berners and 5th Baronet. He had already composed some music which had been published under the name Gerald Tyrwhitt.

Berners lived an eccentric life. He lived in Berkshire but also had houses in London and Rome. He had plenty of money, so that he did not have to work. He had many friends, including the composers Stravinsky, Lambert and William Walton who dedicated his "Belshazzar’s Feast" to him.

Berners’s music is full of Romantic feeling, irony and parody. He wrote a lot for the theatre. He composed "The Triumph of Neptune" in 1926 for Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes. His music could often be described as light music. 

Berners started his strange behaviour when he was quite small. He had heard that a dog could be taught to swim by throwing it into water, so he decided to teach his dog to fly by throwing it out of the window. The dog was not hurt, but Berners was given a beating.

He was often naughty, making silly traps for people. He was sent to boarding school in Cheam when he was nine. There he had a gay relationship with an older boy. He was then sent to Eton College. Berners said that he learned nothing there.

Later, when he was grown up, he painted pigeons at his house and once he even had a giraffe as a pet so that he could have tea with it. He travelled in a Rolls-Royce and kept a clavichord under the front seat. 

He died in 1950 at Faringdon House, leaving his estate to his friend Robert ('Boy') Heber Percy, who lived with him at Faringdon.

His epitaph on his gravestone reads:

Gustav Klimt

Gustav Klimt (July 14, 1862 – February 6, 1918) was an Austrian Symbolist painter. He was one of the most prominent members of the Vienna Secession movement. His major works include paintings, murals, sketches, and other art objects. Many of them are on display in the Vienna Secession gallery. Klimt's primary subject was the female body, and his works are marked by a frank eroticism—nowhere is this more apparent than in his numerous drawings in pencil (see "Mulher sentada", below).

Louis XVIII of France

Louis XVIII, the desired (1755 1824), king of France from April 1814 to March 1815 and again from July 1815 to September 1824. He ascended the throne when the monarchy was restored after the overthrow of Napoleon I and ruled as a constitutional sovereign. Born in Versailles, he was the brother of Louis XVI of France and in early life was known as the comte de Provence. He remained in Paris after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 but escaped to Belgium two years later. After Louis XVI's execution in 1793 he proclaimed himself regent, and after the death of his brother's heir, Louis XVII, in 1795, he took the title Louis XVIII. He lived as an exile in various European countries until he became king after Napoleon's first abdication in 1814. On Napoleon's return to power in 1815, however, Louis again fled to Belgium; later the same year he was restored to the throne after Napoleon's final defeat at Waterloo. The Charter, or constitution, that he promulgated in 1814 established a bicameral legislature, property qualifications for voters, and limitations on freedom of the press.

Louis XVII (27 March 1785 - 8 June 1795) of France and Navarre, son of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, was the King of France and Navarre from 1793 to 1795 although he never ruled. He is also known as Louis-Charles, Duke of Normandy and Fils de France or son of France 
Louis Charles de France was born at the Palace of Versailles, the second son and third child of his parents. He became Dauphin of France after the death of his elder brother in 1789. After his father's death, he was proclaimed "King of France" while exiled with his mother. In 1795, he died of unknown causes during the dungeons of the French Revolution. An autopsy was carried out at the prison and, following a tradition of preserving royal hearts, his heart was smuggled out and preserved by the examining physician, Philippe-Jean Pelletan. Louis-Charles's body was buried in a mass grave. Dr. Pelletan was also shocked at all the scars from abuses of the child, such as whipping, all over the front and back of his torso as well as on his arms, legs, and feet.

Race (sociology)

The term race or racial group refers to the of the human species based on physical characteristics that are passed on to succeeding generations. There are people who come from mixed races and have faced identity issues. As more people mix, it may turn into a race all on its own if there are distinguishing physical characteristics that differ from another race. The most widely used human racial categories are based on salient visual traits (especially skin colour, cranial or facial features and hair texture), and self-identification.

Some scientists argue that although race is a safe taxonomic concept in other species, it cannot be applied to humans.. The biologist's view of race varies a lot at time from the social version of race. 

More recent genetic studies indicate that skin colour may change radically over as few as 25 generations, or about 2,500 years, given the influence of the environment.

The usual criteria involved over the years to define people by common non-scientific (pseudo-scientific) list of physical features. The belief was those who looked alike were derived from a common ancestor (like the children of a big family looking like their 2 common parents). In Europe the people of the World divided in to 4 or in some cases 5 categories, based on skin colour and to a degree the shape of the face as well. The categories were as follows, by Victorian times-




By about the First World War the scientifically inclined Europeans were sub-dividing the 'White race' in to 3 or 4 supposed sub-races, which were-


There was much prejudice based upon this perception of the world as the Europeans and Orientals both regarded them selves as superior to the other skin colours. This all lead to racism, a non-scientific theory, or ideology, that a particular race had become superior or inferior to another via natural selection. It advocated that in the races that make up the human race, there are deep, biologically determined differences, which should not be crossed, because, it is "extremely undesirable. It also states races should live separately and not intermarry. A supporter of racism is called a racist. These attitudes in turn created the horrors of African slavery, Apartheid, the Jim Crow laws, Nazism and Japanese imperialism.

The mid 20th century racial classification by American anthropologist Carleton S. Coon, divided humanity into five races:


In his landmark book "The Races of Europe", Coon defined the Caucasian Race as encompassing the regions of Europe, Central Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and Northeast Africa. His work drew some charges of obsolete thinking or outright racism from a few critics, but some of the terminology he employed continues to be used even today, although the "-oid" suffixes now have in part taken on negative connotations.

In the 21st-Century, Coon's role came under further critical scrutiny when Prof. John P Jackon Jr, noted that the American Coon, "actively aided the segregationist cause in violation of his own standards for scientific objectivity.".

Social Darwinism' refers to various ideologies based on a concept that competition is active among all individuals, or even whole nations as social evolution in human societies. 

It is a social adaptation of the theory of natural selection as first invented by Charles Darwin. "Natural selection" explains success in various animal populations as the outcome of competition between any individual organisms for limited resources popularly known as "survival of the fittest", a term first used by either Herbert Spencer, or Andrew Carnegie. 

Fascist movements have commonly held social darwinist views of nations, races, and societies InNazi Germany, the Nazis used social Darwinism to promote their racialist idea of the German nation was part of the Aryan race and believed in the competition of races. The Nazis tried to strengthen the ‘Aryan race’ in Germany by murdering those they regarded as weaker.Jews, Slavs, Gypsies and disabled people.

It was believed until recently that race and IQ were connected. The fact that environment, such as schooling and alcohol consumption/boozing has a significant effect on IQ undermines the case for the use of IQ data as a source of genetic information .
This prejudice was partially applied in Europe and the USA to both- the Irish, Australian Aborigines, Native American Indians, Blacks, Gypsies, Albanians, Italians, Slavic Russians and Russia's Chechens tribes.

In the late 18th century, Europeans began using the term "Aryan" to refer to the original prehistoric Proto-Indo-Europeans and their descendants up to the present day (i.e., the Indo-European peoples--those Caucasians who are speak the Indo-European languages). It was also assumed at the time, that, Aryans were a naturally culturally superior people. By the late 19th century, some Europeans began to use the name "Aryan" for only the Nordic peoples of Europe (one branch of the Indo-European peoples), as a "pure," "noble" and racially "superior" race they claimed were descended from the original Aryan tribes. The theory that the Aryans first came from Europe became especially popular in Germany and to a lesser degree in Austria and Hungary.

There was much prejudice based upon this perception of the world as the Europeans and Orientals both regarded them selves as superior to the other skin colours, which lead to the horrors of African slavery, Apartheid, the Jim Crow Laws, Nazism and Japanese imperialism. The accidental misinterpretation of the works of Charles Darwin (known as Darwinism) only helped to fuel the non-scientific opinions of 'race' and racial superiority'.

When Europeans came to America, they killed thousands of Native Americans and when the European settlers got to Australia, they started killing of large numbers of Aborigines. In both cases, they regarded the native people as predestined to be inferior and not worth helping. This view was based on the Europeans' opinions on Darwinism and how it could be used to judge the value of the native peoples. 

With the birth of there empires, many other native tribes suffered in Canada, New Zealand, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India. 

Japan also held similar beliefs about Chinese and Koreans in their colonies.

Racism in the U.K., Ireland and France was usually about limiting the rights of Jews, Gypsies and minorities like the French Basques.

As the countries became independent after the 1950's, many migrated to the U.K. and France, but were decremented against. Some British cafes and hotels would not welcome in Caribbean guests and the French made Arabs feel unwelcome in some French towns as well. Since the 1960's, India, Pakistani and Bangladeshi people have moved to the U.K. and were victimised and 'Packy-bashed'. The horror of 9/11, 2001, has heightened the French and British fears about Islam and Arabs in general. Polish and Brazilian migrant labours are also discriminated against in some places. Racist parties like the U.K.'s British National Party and National Front trade on these fears to get votes.

Alleged scientific findings of racial differences were used by Nazi Germany to justify the racialist policy with its concept of "Großdeutschland" (Greater Germany) and the Nordic racecial idea. The Nazis attitude towards the Jews were Anti-Semitic and falsely blamed them for Germany's defeat in World War I and the Great Depression. The Nazis and some of their anti-Semitic allies, like Hungary, committed genocide against the Jews during the Holocaust of World War II. 

Both the Nazis and Romania's Iron Guard also persecuted the Gypsies, who were considered part of the allegedly inferior 'Indic' race. During World War II, the Nazis embarked on systematic attempt at genocide of the Romanies/Gypsies, known as the "Porajmos". The Nazis also knowingly killed of thousands of Slavs, lesbians, Communists, liberals and gays.

Most Germans and Austrians are ashamed of this, but Hungary has yet to really face up to what it did to the Roma. Support for the racist Jobbik party rises.

Fascist Benito Mussolini, in a 1919 speech to denounce Soviet Russia, claimed that Jewish bankers in London and New York City were bound by the chains of race to Moscow, and claimed that 80 percent of the Soviet leaders were Jews.

Many Italian fascists held anti-Slavist views, especially against neighbouring Yugoslav nations, who they saw as being in competition with Italy, which had laid claim to the Yugoslavia's region of Dalmatia.

Mussolini said Italy would get its own way and was willing to use force to settle arguments. An early example was Italy's bombardment of the Greek island of Corfu in 1923. Soon after he succeeded in setting up a puppet regime in Albania and crushed a rebellion in Libya, which had been an Italian colony since 1912.

Italy, like Germany, Austria and Hungary mistakenly regarded all Slavs and Gypsies as stupid, racially inferior due to the effects of Social Darwinism and undeserving of there basic rights! Anti-Arab discrimination was also used in parts of Libya. 

Some Italians still hate Arab, Gypsy and Romanian immigrants today.

The Iron Guard was an antisemitic fascist movement and political party in Romania from 1927 to 1941. They despised and denounced both Jews and Gypsies. 

Some Romanian people still support these prejudice views even today.

American racism has been a major issue in the country since before its founding. Historically dominated by socially and ethnically diverse White settler society race in the United States as a concept became significant in relation to other groups. Generally racist attitudes in the country have been most onerously applied to Native Americans, African Americans and some "foreign-seeming" action against Mexican immigrants among others. The Chinese, Japanese and Irish had trouble in America, during the 19th Century, but the Blacks fell foul of the Jim Crow Laws which once racially separated the racist parts of America between Blacks and Whites. These first emerged in the late 19th Century and lasted to the mid 1960's and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Millions of Africans were killed while they were held as prisoners or as slaves by the Europeans and Arabs. The African-American people and some others call this "The Black Holocaust".

South African Apartheid laws were a system was used to deny many rights of Non-white people The laws allowed the white minority to keep the Black majority out of certain areas. Black people had to carry special papers (passes) or have permission to live and work in particular areas. Whites opposed intermarriage with non-whites and Coloured people were also discriminated against, but not as badly as the Non-whites. The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949 prohibited marriage between persons of different races and the Immorality Act of 1950 made sexual relations with a person of a different race a criminal offence . The Blacks suffered greatly and were even banned from voteing at one point.

The Imperial Rule Assistance Association ("Taisei Yokusankai") was a coalition of fascist and nationalist political movements of Japan such as the Imperial Way Faction ("Kōdōha") and the Society of the East ("Tōhōkai"). It was formed under the guidance of Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe Prior to creation of the IRAA, Konoe had already effectively nationalized strategic industries, the news media, and labour unions, in preparation for total war with China. Japan needed more land, minerals and colonies, so they annexed Korea, Manchuria and part of China. The Japanese regarded the Chines, Koreans and Europeans as an inferior race that should be crushed and exploited.

When Konoe's successor, Hideki Tōjō took over the IRAA he attempted to establish himself as the absolute leader, or "Shogun", of Japan, under the Emperor of Japan.

Some Japanese still believe that they did not commit as many massacres as the Western World and China said they did.

With the revelations of what the Holocaust had done to its victims and how the civil rights movement tried to liberate the Afro-Caribbeans from racist White supremacist rule in South Africa and the southern USA (e.g.-Mississippi and Alabama ), the old ideas about race were swept away along with the prejudices that followed in its wake! Blacks could vote in South Africa after a 50 year ban and the word 'Nigger' fell out use.

In some cases positive discrimination, the ethnics 1st laws and "political correctness" have taken the situation to the opposite extreme, leading to accusations in the UK, USA and Australia of reveres racism, that is to say racism in favor, not against the ethnic minorities. Political correctness is a term applied to language, ideas, policies, or behavior seen as seeking to minimize offense to gender, racial, cultural, disabled, aged or other identity groups. Conversely, the term "politically incorrect" is used to refer to language or ideas that may cause offense or that are unconstrained by orthodoxy or good manners (e.g.- racists and Islamophobics).

The United States is now a diverse country and in 2006, it became the third nation in world history to reach 300 million people. China and India each each got just over 1 billion people in them.

The spectacular growth of the Hispanic population through immigration from principally Mexico among other places combined with and generally high birth rates are noted as a partial factor for the USA's rising population in the last quarter-century. The 2000 census also found Native Americans/Amerindians at their highest population ever, 4.5 million, since the U.S was founded in 1776.

In biology, a race is group of organisms. These will usually be all of the same species. They form a population, a group within that species. Sometimes this is called a subspecies. Each organism is able to breed with any other organism within the same species. For various reasons, like geographical separation, most organisms will breed with other organisms of the same population. This will mean that phenotypes (visible traits) that are common to most individuals of the population, will become more prominent.

Genetic drift is the random change in gene frequencies between generations, but, a few individuals may leave behind more descendants and thus genes than other individuals. The genes of the next generation will be the genes of these “lucky” individuals' children, not necessarily the healthier or “better” individuals' children.

Plinian eruption

A Plinian eruption is a kind of volcanic eruption which is similar to that of Mount Vesuvius in the year 79 AD. It is named after Pliny the Younger who wrote the only surviving eyewitness account of the eruption. That eruption of Vesuvius killed Pliny the Elder, the uncle of Pliny the Younger.

Plinian eruptions have columns of gas and volcanic ash high into the stratosphere. There is a large amount of pumice into the atmosphere and very powerful gas blast eruptions.

Short eruptions can end in less than a day. Longer ones can take several days to months. These eruptions begin with clouds of volcanic ash and occasionally pyroclastic flows. Sometimes the amount of magma erupted is so large that the top of the volcano collapses. This leaves a caldera behind. Fine ash can deposit over large areas. Plinian eruptions often happen with loud noises, such as those created by Krakatoa.

Some examples of large Plinian eruptions that formed calderas include the following:
The lava is usually rhyolitic and has a lot of silicates. Basaltic lavas are unusual for Plinian eruptions; the most recent example is the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera.

Pliny wrote about what his uncle's did after first seeing the eruption:

Pliny the Elder went to rescue some of the victims. He sailed across the Bay of Naples to Stabiae (near the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia). Pliny the Younger wrote an account of his death, and suggested that he collapsed and died through inhaling poisonous gases emitted by the volcano. His body was found buried under the ashes of the Vesuvius with no apparent injuries on 26 August, after the plume had dispersed. This confirmed the death through asphyxiation or poisoning.

Crater (constellation)

Crater () is a constellation. In Latin it means cup. It is a constellation in Greek mythology (Apollo). It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 1st century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is located in the Southern Hemisphere. 

The name "Crater" is taken from a Greek myth. In the story, a crow or raven serves Apollo. It is sent to get water, but it rests lazily on the journey. After finally getting the water in a cup, it takes back a water snake as well, as an excuse. According to the myth, Apollo saw through the trick and angrily cast the cup, crow, and snake into the sky. The constellations of Corvus the crow and Hydra the water-snake are also taken from this myth.

Gwar

Gwar (usually written as GWAR) is an American satirical thrash metal/punk band formed in 1984. They are best known for their very strange monster costumes and using vulgar, rude words in their songs. Their obscene stage performances which involve violence, slaughtering, profanity, obscene comments about politics are meant to scare, frighten, shock and amuse people. They have won a Grammy Award.

Gwar first formed in 1984 in Richmond, Virginia. The band was made up of Joey Slutman (Joey Byalwec) vocals, Oderus Humongous (Dave Brockie) lead guitar, Balsac The Jaws of Death (Steve Douglas) bass guitar and backing vocals, and Hans Spincter (Sean Summer) drums.
However the group has had many changes. Joey Byalwec left the band in 1986 eventually making Oderus Humongous no longer the group's guitar player but GWAR's permanent vocalist and Balsac the Jaws of Death no longer the band's bass guitarist But the band's Backup vocalist.

After many long years of practicing, GWAR released their first album, "Hell O!" in 1988 on Shimmy Disc Records. With a few new members and characters. The group for "Hell O!" were Oderus Humongous (Dave Brockie) lead vocals, Flattus Maximus (Dewey Dowell) lead guitar, Nippelus Erectus (Rob Mosky) drums, Beefcake the Mighty (Michael Bishop) bass guitar, and Balsac the Jaws of Death (Steve Douglas) on backing vocals.

A year later in 1989, Gwar released their first live CD "RAW-GWAR" showing the band with their very 1st fans and their morbid, violent graphic and political and taboo related stage performances.

In 1990 Gwar released their second album, "Scumdogs of The Universe". They left Shimmy Disc Records and recorded for Metal Blade Records. Gwar's music changed from hardcore punk, in "Scumdogs of the Universe" they have more of a crossover thrash/punk rock sound. The band's first album, "Hell O!", did not have any famous songs, but Scumdogs includes Gwar's first two famous songs, "Sick of You" and "King Queen"

The day after the release of Scumdogs, the band released their second live CD, "Live From Antarctica". In 1991 the band released their first music video, a video of "Sick of You".

GWAR released their third and most controversial album "America Must Be Destroyed" in 1992. Certain songs on the album were described as "raunchy" and "disturbing". This album was the first without Steve Douglas as the character Balsac the Jaws of Death. He was replaced by Mike Derks, who is still the current Balsac character. 

Their fourth album, "This Toilet Earth", was recorded in 1994. It is considered to be the most strangest album it contains elements of Crust,Punk,Grindcore,Horror Punk, Traditional Punk Rock,Heavy Metal, Thrash Metal and Hard rock heavily influenced by the early 1980's Thrash metal groups Metallica,Slayer and Anthrax.
GWAR's 5th studio album Ragnarok was released in 1995 it contains an experimental combination of Crossover Thrash and Funk rock.

Gwar's 6th album Carnival of Chaos was released in 1997. It is considered to be the most experimental GWAR album ever released it was the last album to feature Pete Lee as Flattus Maximus. 

We Kill Everything
Gwar's 7th album released in 1999 "We Kill Everything" is considered to be the band's breathrough CD. It is considered to be the lousiest album ever released by the band. It is the first album to feature Greg Ottinger as Flattus Maximus. It turs out Gwar has revisited their Hardcore Punk/Scum rock sound from the 1980's. Gwar fans despised the album. 

So in 2001 GWAR returned to their thrash metal sound after releasing their eighth CD "Violence Has arrived. It also revisited the brutal sound and violent themes similar to their earlier albums.

Giuseppe Mazzini (1805 – 1872), known as the soul of Italy, as an Italian patriot, philosopher, Freemason and politician. His efforts helped bring about the modern Italian state[2] in place of the several separate states, many dominated by foreign powers, that existed until the 19th century. He also helped define the modern European movement for popular democracy in a republican state.

Karl Marx, on an interview by R. Landor in 1871, said that Mazzini's ideas represents "nothing better than the old idea of a middle-class republic." Marx believed, especially after the Revolutions of 1848, that this middle class point of view had become reactionary and the proletariat had nothing to do with it.

Charles X of France

Charles X (1757-1836), king of France and Navarre (1824-30). He was the grandson of Louis XV and younger brother of kings Louis XVI and Louis XVIII. Charles was known as Charles Philippe, comte d'Artois, until he became king. During the French Revolution he was one of the leaders of the émigrés. Charles X was the last senior Bourbon to rule France.

Charles-Philippe was born in 1757, the youngest son of the Dauphin Louis Ferdinand, and his wife, the Dauphine Marie Josèphe, at the Palace of Versailles. Charles was named comte d'Artois at birth by his grandfather, the reigning King Louis XV. As the youngest male in the family Charles seemed unlikely ever to become king.

Charles' father died in 1765, which left Charles' oldest surviving brother, Louis-Auguste (the later Louis XVI), to succeed their father in the capacity of Dauphin, the French equivalent to a crown prince or heir apparent. Charles' mother, Marie Josèphe, never recovered from the loss of her husband and she died in March 1767 from tuberculosis. This left Charles an orphan at the age of nine.

Throughout the 1770s, Charles spent lavishly. He accumulated enormous debts (they totalled 21 million livres), which Louis XVI paid for him in the early 1780s. Their brother the comte de Provence also accumulated debts of a similar magnitude, which Louis XVI also paid off.

His political awakening started with the first great crisis of the monarchy in 1786, after which he headed the reactionary faction at the court of Louis XVI. The comte d'Artois supported the removal of the aristocracy's financial privileges, but was opposed to any reduction in the social privileges enjoyed by both the Church and the nobility.

When the French Revolutionary Wars broke out in 1792, Charles escaped to Great Britain. King George III of Great Britain welcomed the comte d'Artois warmly, and gave him a generous allowance. He lived in Edinburgh and London with his mistress Louise de Polastron. After the accession (1814) of Louis XVIII to the French throne, Charles returned to France, where he headed the ultraroyalist party of reaction.

Charles' first act as King of France was to grant the style of Royal Highness to his cousins of the cadet branch of the House of Bourbon, the Orléans. Because the Duke of Orleans had voted the death of his brother Louis XVI, Louis XVIII had greatly disliked the Orléans family. However, Charles intended it to create a unified House of Bourbon.His favoritism during his reign toward the Roman Catholic Church and the aristocracy aroused great opposition, leading to the revolution of July 1830.

Charles X is a strong believer in absolutism and rejected the Charter of the French Liberties, which is issued by his predecessor and brother Louis XVIII. In July 1830, he suspended the legislature, limited the right to vote, and restricted the press. Liberals and radicals responded forcefully to the absolute king. In Paris, angry citizens threw up barricades across the narrow streets. Others fired the soldiers and throw stones and roof tiles. The revolutionary tricolor flew from the towers of Notre Dame cathedral. Charles was forced to abdicate. He again went into exile in Britain. He was succeeded by his cousin, Louis-Philippe, son of the Duke of Orleans who had supported the French Revolution.

Charles caught cholera when he arrived in Gorizia, Italy. He died on November 6 1836. The townspeople draped their windows in black to mourn him. Charles was buried in the Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady, in the Franciscan Kostanjevica Monastery (now in Nova Gorica, Slovenia).

Charles X married Princess Maria Teresa of Savoy, the daughter of Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia and Maria Antonia of Spain on 16 November 1773. The couple had four children:

Muslim League (Pakistan)

The Pakistan Muslim League was founded in 1962, as a successor to the previously disbanded Muslim League in Pakistan. Unlike the original PML which ended in 1958 when General Ayub Khan banned all political parties, each subsequent Muslim League was in some way propped by the military dictators of the time: Ayub Khan, General Zia-ul-Haq and General Pervez Musharraf. Every time the pro-establishment political leaders were put together, who splintered apart when the general's blessings faded away. 

Currently, Pakistan Muslim League refers to any of the these political parties in Pakistan:





Historically, Pakistan Muslim League can also refer to any of the following political parties in Pakistan:


Recently Pakistan Muslim League (PML-Q) made headlines when on 31 December 2007, armed men belonging to the party kidnapped the human rights lawyer, Asma Jahangirs daughters who were in company of some friends, at gun point and brought them to the PML-Q main election office. The girls were detained illegally, abused, severely beaten. Asma's youngest daughter was then dragged off to a separate room by some of the gunmen. Asma Jahangir only barely managed to rescue her daughters and their friends and called the police for assistance. The girls had been out filing ripped and torn election posters in Lahore City in the aftermath of the assassination of Benezir Bhutto. The Police took the side of the gunmen, insisting that the girls hand over the tape, or else they would be kidnapped, raped and killed.

<doc id="201081" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=201081" title="Eels (band)">
Eels (band)

Eels is a rock music project consisting of Mark Oliver Everett and many other people.

Mark Oliver Everett, his alternate persona Mr. E, and Eels are all the same person. Mark Oliver Everett is his birth name. Mr. E is his nickname, which he began calling himself as a teenager because it sounded "mysterious." Also, many of his friends made fun of him because his initials spelled out "MOE," which he hated.

Unlike most traditional rock bands, Eels rarely plays with the same combinations of members twice. Mark Everett is the only constant member, meaning that he is the only one who plays on every single album and live show. All other members are friends of his who contribute other instruments to the albums and concerts, and most of them are in other bands, such as Aysa and Chloe from the pop band Smoosh. Many do not use their real names, as Everett does; for instance, bassist Koool G Murder performed on the albums Souljacker and Hombre Lobo, and has played bass at most shows on the tours for both albums.

Each Eels concert is different. Most feature the members who perform the song on the album playing the instruments that they did on that song, although many are acoustic sets, meaning that Mark Everett simply sings and plays piano all by himself. A lot of songs that Eels perform live are covers (songs written by other people), and songs that have never appeared on any albums.

Mark Everett's father was Hugh Everett III, a scientist who was the first person to propose the idea that our universe is just one of several connected "alternate" universes. At the time (1954), no one believed Everett, and he considered himself a failure. He died when Mark was 19.

Mark's first album was called Bad Dude in Love (1985). It was self-released, meaning that Everett recorded and designed the packaging for the entire album all on his own, selling only five hundred copies to a few friends. That album was the first and last to be released under his full name, Mark Oliver Everett. His next album, A Man Called E (1992) was released only as E, and sold many more copies than Bad Dude in Love. Because many critics did not know who E was, they were confused by the album's title, but the album still sold well.

Everett's next album as E was Broken Toy Shop (1993). The cover art, which depicts Everett sitting in the center of a toy city, has been said to be his least favorite album cover out of all his releases. This would be Everett's last album using his real name or his pseudonym E, as Eels' first album, Beautiful Freak, featuring bassist Tommy Walter and drummer Butch, was released in 1996.

In 1998, Everett became the only living member of his family after his sister killed herself and his mother died of lung cancer. He wrote 16 songs about his sadness that later became his next Eels album, Electro-Shock Blues, featuring Butch from the last album. Butch and Everett would also be the only members to appear on 2000's Daisies of the Galaxy.

In 2001, Everett participated in a philosophical vacation on which he was not alllowed to write or speak for religious reasons. Finding himself inspired, he broke the rules and wrote 12 songs that would later become Souljacker, with Koool G Murder, Butch, Joe Gore, John Parish, and Adam Siegel. During this time, he had stopped shaving, and his beard had begun to grow very long, as shown in this picture. Today, Everett’s beard is even longer, and the most recent Eels album (Hombre Lobo – Spanish for werewolf, featuring Koool G Murder and Knuckles) features songs that Everett wrote about how the beard made him look and feel more “dangerous.”

Following Souljacker, Eels released Shootenanny!, an album that drew a lot of negative attention to the band (at the time consisting of E, Butch, Joe Gore, and Koool G Murder) for Everett’s inappropriate behavior at press events to support the album. In an interview with an Australian television show about rock music, Everett joked about the interviewer waking him up after having sex with a prostitute and doing heroin the night before. Also, Everett was asked to write a review of the diaries of Kurt Cobain (who had died eight years before); his review was a single sentence: “Please don’t do this to me after I die.” Eels’ subsequent release, Blinking Lights and Other Revelations, a double-disc concept album about a journey through life but not in a chronological order, was much more well-received.

In addition to these studio albums, Eels has also released one Best Of collection, six live albums, two collections of unreleased material, a book by Everett about his father (and a subsequent documentary film that aired on BBC), and has written songs for eleven movies, including all three Shrek films.

Yom Kippur

Yom Kippur is a Jewish festival. It is also known as the "day of atonement". It lasts 25 hours. During this period, Jews ask God to forgive them for all their sins. People fast on this day, and they have to go to temple. Other things people are not allowed to do during Yom Kippur include washing, using perfumes or lotions, and having any kind of sexual intercourse.

Many wear white as a symbol of purity.

Yom Kippur is the tenth day of the month of Tishrei in the Hebrew calendar. In Jewish tradition, God writes the fate of each person for the coming year into a "book" on Rosh Hashanah. God waits until Yom Kippur to "seal" the fate. During the Days of Awe, a Jew tries to amend his or her behavior. They will also seek forgiveness for wrongs done against God ("bein adam le'Makom") and wrongs done against other human beings ("bein adam lechavero"). The evening and day of Yom Kippur are used for public and private confessions of guilt ("Vidui"). At the end of Yom Kippur, a Jew considers themselves absolved by God.

The Yom Kippur prayer service includes several special parts. One of them is the number of prayer services. A regular day has three prayer services (Ma'ariv, the evening prayer; Shacharit, the morning prayer; and Mincha, the afternoon prayer). A Shabbat or Yom Tov has four prayer services (Ma'ariv; Shacharit; Musaf, the additional prayer; and Mincha). Yom Kippur has five prayer services (Ma'ariv; Shacharit; Musaf; Mincha; and Ne'ilah, the closing prayer). The prayer services also include a public confession of sins ("Vidui") and a unique prayer dedicated to the special Yom Kippur avodah (service) of the Kohen Gadol in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem.

Yom Kippur is one of the holiest of Jewish holidays and it is observed by many Jews who may not observe other holidays. Many Jews fast and attend synagogue on Yom Kippur, where the number of worshippers attending is often double or triple the normal attendance. Many other Jews choose not to fast.

Patent troll

A patent troll is an unkind phrase used to describe a company or person that owns a patent and tries to get other people to pay a lot of money for the right to use the patent. The patent troll usually asks for an amount of money that is less than defending a lawsuit. 

A patent troll is different from other patent owners for two reasons. First, the patent troll usually does not make or sell anything products itself. Second, a patent troll is also not usually the inventor. The patent troll instead buys the patent from other companies, and, usually, very cheap because the other company was going out of business.

Patent trolls make a lot of people unhappy because the money paid is a lot like a tax. The term troll itself is meant to invoke the image from fairy tales of a mean monster living under a bridge that makes people pay to cross the bridge.

House of Bonaparte

The House of Bonaparte is an imperial and royal European dynasty founded by Napoleon I of France in 1804, a Corsican military leader who rose to power and transformed the French Republic into the French Empire. The dynasty ruled from 1804 to 1815 and again from 1852 to 1870. Current head Jean-Christophe Napoléon is ironically from a Bourbon mother.
Napoleon Bonaparte is the most significant person associated with the Bonaparte family because he created the First French Empire that conquered much of Europe in the early 19th century. He was elected as first consul of France on November 10, 1799 with the help of his brother, Lucien Bonaparte, speaker of the Council of Five Hundred. He later crowned himself Emperor of the French in December 2, 1804 and King of Italy in May 26 1805. He then made his elder brother Joseph (1768–1844) king of Naples (1806–1808) and then of Spain (1808–1813), his third brother Louis, king of Holland (1806–1810), and his youngest brother Jerome Bonaparte, king of Westphalia(1807-1813). 

Napoleon's son Napoleon François Charles Joseph (1811–1832) was created king of Rome (1811–1814) and was later styled Napoleon II by loyalists of the dynasty, though he only ruled for two weeks after his father's abdication. Charles Louis Napoléon (1808–1873), son of Louis Napoléon, was president of France in 1848 and emperor in 1852 until 1870, reigning as Napoléon III. A political movement for Corsican independence surfaced in the 1990s which included a Bonapartist restoration in its programme.

<doc id="201293" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=201293" title="Monarch (butterfly)">
Monarch (butterfly)

The Monarch ("Danaus plexippus") is an insect and a butterfly. It is put in the family category of Nymphalidae. It is the most well-known butterfly in North America.

Monarchs are known for their long annual migration. In North America, they travel long distances in the fall and again in the spring. They migrate south beginning in August. If they don't make it to frost-free areas during this time, the frost and cold temperatures will kill them. A migration towards the north happens in the spring. No single individual makes the whole round trip.

The wings are orange with black edges and veins. The male has a spot on his bottom wing. It is called an androconium (plural, androconia). The spot gives out to attract females. The wingspan ranges from 8.9 to 10.2 centimeters (3½ to 4 inches). The Viceroy butterfly ("Limenitis archippus") is similar. It has an extra black band across the bottom wing. 

The Monarch caterpillar is banded with yellow, black, and white stripes. The head is also striped with yellow and black. There are four black body extensions, two on each end of the body. They look similar to antennae. The caterpillar will be as long as 5 centimeters (2 inches).

The Monarch butterfly has a wingspan that ranges from 8.9 to 10.2 centimeters (3½ to 4 inches). The upper side of the wings is orange with black veins and black wing margins. (The margin is the edge of the wing.) There are white spots in the black wing margins. The male has a small black spot on his bottom wing. This spot gives out scents to help the female find and mate with the male. This spot is called an androconium (plural, androconia). The female does not have an androconium on her bottom wing. The underside of the wings is a tan-orange color with black veins. The wing margins are black with white spots in them. 

A white form of the Monarch has been seen in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and the United States. It has been seen as early as 1896. It was named "nivosus" by lepidopterists (a lepidopterist is a person who studies butterflies and moths). It is grayish white in all areas of the wings that are normally orange. The white form makes up about 1% or less of all Monarchs except for on Oahu, Hawaii where it has kept populations as high as 10%.

In North America, the Monarch is found from southern Canada to northern South America. It sometimes wanders to western Europe, sometimes as far as Greece. It reaches Europe from being transported by USA ships. It can also wander to Europe by flying there if weather and wind conditions are right. It has also been found in Bermuda, Hawaii, the Solomons, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Australia, New Guinea, Ceylon, India, the Azores, and the Canary Islands.

Monarch butterflies are known for their long annual migration. In North America, they make large migrations towards the south starting in August until the first frost. A migration towards the north takes place in the spring. No single individual makes the whole round trip. Female Monarchs lay eggs for the next generation during these migrations.

By the end of October, the Monarchs that are east of the Rocky Mountains migrate to Mexico. They migrate to the (safe or protected places) of the Mariposa Monarca Biosphere Reserve in the Mexican states of Michoacán and Mexico. Most of the Monarchs that are west of the Rocky Mountains do not travel all the way down to Mexico. Instead, they overwinter (spend the winter) in many places in central and southern California.

While in Mexico, the Monarchs gather in very large numbers to rest. They perch on suitable trees and bushes by (hold on to tightly) with their feet. They cling to each other making layers and layers of resting Monarchs overwintering. This was discovered by Dr. Fred Urquhart of the University of Toronto, who studied Monarch butterflies for nearly forty years. He knew the Monarchs migrated because he would stop seeing them after a certain time of the year. He put a label on each Monarch he found. On this label was his name, address, and a request to send him the butterfly if it was found.

A few months later, people from all over North America and Mexico began returning his labelled butterflies to him. Mexico was the southernmost area from which he had received a butterfly, so he started traveling there to look for the Monarchs. For many years, he traveled to Mexico. There he climbed through jungles, walked through forests, and talked to the people he found. He finally heard there was a place west of Mexico City where people had seen lots of Monarchs all together. After a long search, he finally found millions of Monarch butterflies covering every part of the area.

During the spring migration, the population that is east of the Rocky Mountains may reach as far north as Texas and Oklahoma. The second, third and fourth generations return to their northern places in the United States and Canada in the spring.

The Monarch can be found in many different kinds of habitats. When it is breeding, it is found in habitats with milkweed (a kind of plant). Some of these habitats include, fields, meadows, prairies, parks in or near cities, gardens, and roadsides. The Monarch can be found in almost any kind of habitat during migration. It overwinters in pine, cypress, and eucalyptus groves in California. It overwinters in fir forests and pine groves in Mexico.

Much of the Monarch's breeding habitat is not very good anymore. In some states and provinces, milkweed is thought to be a weed. In these places, the milkweed is killed to keep livestock from eating it and becoming sick. With fewer milkweed plants, the Monarch does not have as much habitat to breed in.

The Monarch butterfly goes through complete metamorphosis.

The female lays her eggs one by one. They are laid on the underside of the leaves of caterpillar's food plant. The eggs are light yellow. Freshly laid eggs are creamy-white. After three to four days, they turn dark gray. The egg usually weighs about 0.54 milligrams. It is about 1.2 millimeters long. Its diameter is about 0.87 millimeters (average on 55 eggs).

The caterpillar out of the egg. The young caterpillar is a gray-black color with a black head. After the first molt (shedding its skin) the caterpillar is banded with yellow, black, and white stripes. The head is also striped with yellow and black. There are four black body extensions, two on each end of the body. They look similar to antennae. The caterpillar will reach a length of 5 centimeters (2 inches). The caterpillar eats the leaves and flowers of the food plant. It make no nests or shelters. It grows very quickly, and because of this, it molts four to five times.

After the caterpillar molts one last time, it makes a chrysalis. A chrysalis is not the same as a cocoon. The Monarch caterpillar attaches its back end (posterior) to a support, and hangs downward in the shape of the letter 'J'. The inside of the caterpillar's body begins to change and it splits its skin to form the blue-green chrysalis. The blue-green chrysalis has a band of black and bright gold near the top. There are other gold spots lower down. After spending many weeks in the chrysalis, the adult finally comes out as a butterfly.

The Viceroy ("Limenitis archippus") is similar to but is smaller than the Monarch. It has an extra black band across the bottom wing that the Monarch does not have.

The Queen ("Danaus gilippus") is dark reddish-brown instead of orange. It does not have black veins. There are white spots on the top wing submarginal (near the edge of the wing) area. These spots are on both the upper side and the underside.

The Soldier ("Danaus eresimus") is also dark reddish-brown instead of orange. It has thin, black veins. The underside of the bottom wing has a dark center. It has light brown, square-shaped spots around the dark center.

Monarchs are bad-tasting and poisonous. They are poisonous because of a chemical known as cardenolide (cardiac glycoside). The chemical slows the heart-beat of vertebrates. Monarch caterpillars get this chemical when they feed on milkweed. When the Monarch becomes a butterfly, it no longer eats milkweed, but it still has the chemical in its body. The butterfly shows that they are not good to eat with their bright orange and black wings. This is known as aposematic coloration. A bird may try to eat a Monarch, but it will become sick and vomit after eating it. After this experience, the bird learns not to eat another Monarch.

The Viceroy is similar looking to the Monarch, but the Viceroy does not have the milkweed poison in its body. Birds that have had the bad experience of eating a Monarch will usually not eat a Viceroy. It is an example of Müllerian mimicry.

Overwintering Monarchs in Mexico are often eaten by Black-headed Grosbeaks. These birds are immune to the glycoside. Other birds, such as orioles and jays, have learned to eat only the thoracic muscles and the body parts inside the abdomen. These parts have less poison than the rest of the body. Some mice are also immune to large amounts of the poison. Over time, overwintering Monarchs become less poisonous. This makes them more likely to be eaten by predators. In Mexico, about 14% of the overwintering Monarchs are eaten by birds and mice.
On Oahu, Hawaii, there is a white form of the Monarch. This is because two species of birds have been introduced. The two birds are known as the Red-vented Bulbul and the Red-whiskered Bulbul. They were introduced in 1965 and 1966. They are now the most common insectivore birds. They are probably the only birds that eat insects as big as the Monarch. Monarchs in Hawaii have low cardiac glycoside levels, but the birds may be immune to the chemical. The two bird species eat the caterpillars and sometimes the chrysalids. They look for them on branches and the underside of leaves in milkweed bushes. The birds also eat resting adults and egg-laying females. They eat flying Monarchs less often. The white form has a higher chance of living than the orange one. The white form does not fit the birds' search image of a normal Monarch, and so it is not eaten. This kind of defense is known as apostatic selection. The white form is also camouflaged in patches of light shining through groups of leaves.

Parasites include the tachinid flies "Sturmia convergens" and "Lesperia archippivora". Caterpillars that have the "Lesperia archippivora" maggots inside them will finish their last molt. They will then hang upside down on a horizontal surface. They die before they turn into a chrysalis. At that time one white maggot comes out of the caterpillar. The maggot then forms a brown pupa on the ground.

The bacteria "Micrococcus flacidifex danai" also infects the caterpillar and causes “black death”. Just before turning into a chrysalis, the caterpillar will find a horizontal surface. They die a few hours later. The body turns black shortly after. The bacteria "Pseudomonas aeruginosa" causes infections in weakened insects. It is a common cause of death in insects that are raised in laboratories.

The Monarch is the state insect of Alabama, Idaho, Illinois, Minnesota, and Texas. It is the state butterfly of 
Vermont and West Virginia. 
It was nominated in 1990 as the national insect of the United States of America. It was nominated along with the honeybee ("Apis mellifera"). However, the legislation did not pass.

Many people like to attract Monarchs by growing a butterfly garden with the plant "Asclepias physocarpa". Others like raising them for fun or for educational purposes. have been made for migrating Monarchs. The sanctuaries are found at the Monarch's favorite overwintering places. These migrations can create a lot of tourism revenue.

Many schools also enjoy caring for Monarchs. They start with caterpillars. When the caterpillars mature into butterflies, they are then set free into the wild.

Some organizations, such as the Cape May Bird Observatory, have Monarch labeling programs. Labels are placed on the wing of the butterfly. The labels have information on them. This helps scientists track the Monarchs during their migration. It also helps the scientists study the paths that the Monarchs take on their migration.

Adult Monarchs have been seen on a number of different nectar plants. Here is a list of some of them:


Males will also take in water and minerals from damp soil and small, wet rocks. This is known as "puddling". The Monarch has also been seen puddling at an oil stain on pavement.

Here is a list of plants that the Monarch caterpillar feeds on:

Naturalism (philosophy)

Naturalism is "the idea or belief that nothing exists beyond the natural world".

It is a kind of philosophy called metaphysical, because it covers everything: "nature is all there is, and all basic truths are truths of nature". 

All the things and powers which are commonly called supernatural, such as God, souls or witchcraft do not exist, according to this position. 

Methodological or scientific naturalism is specifically concerned with practical methods for acquiring knowledge. 

Many scientists use the scientific method for their research. The results they get from this research are independent of their beliefs or religious views.
Hypotheses are be explained and tested only by reference to natural causes and events.

Explanations for observations are only useful when they are based on hypotheses of natural causes. An explanation that relies on a natural mechanism that works according to certain rules is usable. Explanations that need miracles to work are not. Methodological naturalism is the principle underlying all of modern science. 

Some philosophers extend this idea, so that it can be applied to all of philosophy as well. Science and philosophy, according to this view, are said to form a continuum. W.V. Quine, George Santayana, and other philosophers have advocated this view.

A number of other philosophical ideas are similar to naturalism:

The première was in Paris in 1913.

The ballet and its music is often called by its French title "Le Sacre du Printemps". It is one of the most famous pieces of music of the 20th century and it had a big influence on many composers. It is the start of modernism in music. The music has very complicated rhythms and strange chords (dissonances) that people were not used to at the time. They were more used to Romantic ballet music such as that by Tchaikovsky. 

The effect was sensational. People started to fight in the theatre because some hated the music, while others thought it brilliant. This made everybody want to hear it and so it became well-known, and people got used to the new sounds.

The music lasts about 40 minutes, and is divided into two parts. It has the subtitle "Pictures from Pagan Russia". Stravinsky had the idea of composing music which was about country people from old times in Russia who danced a fertility rite. This means: a ceremony which is supposed to bring good luck to the next year’s harvest. In this ancient Russian dance, one young girl is chosen to dance and dance until she dies. She is the sacrifice. She is sacrificed to the god of spring.

The painter Nicholas Roerich talked with Stravinsky about the idea for this ballet in 1910. Stravinsky started writing down musical ideas while he was still working on his ballet "The Firebird". Then he worked on "Petrushka". In 1912 he was able to concentrate on "The Rite of Spring". All these ballets were composed for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. They were a very famous group of Russian dancers who worked in Europe, mostly in Paris.

"The Rite of Spring" was first performed by the Ballets Russes on 29 May 1913 at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris. The conductor was Pierre Monteux. The audience were shocked at the primitive kind of dancing and the irregular rhythms and strange orchestral sounds and unusual chords. Nijinsky’s choreography was so different from classical ballet. Nijinsky found it difficult to work with Stravinsky and difficult to work with the music.

The complicated music and violent dance steps made the people start to boo. They started to shout and whistle. They argued, and other people who liked it argued back. Then some people started to fight. In the end the police were called. Stravinksy was very upset and ran out of the theatre. The performance was a scandal, but this actually made people curious and soon the ballet became very famous. It was performed seven times that season, and there were no more interruptions during the other performances.

The music was first heard in the United States in 1924. It was a concert performance, in other words: it was played by an orchestra at a concert, but without any dancing. This is how it is usually heard today. 

Stravinsky composed a version for two people to play at one piano (piano duet). He finished this before he finished the orchestral work. This seemed quite natural, because he sat at the piano while he composed the music. He continued to make changes to the orchestral score even after the first performance.

"The Rite of Spring" is divided into two parts, and each part has several sections:



Stravinsky's music has many complex harmonies with dissonant sounds. There are passages with polyrhythms (several rhythms at once) as well as polytonality (music in several keys at once). The time signatures keep changing, and he often uses ostinati (repeated patterns).

Stravinsky wanted his music to describe the releasing of lots of energy. Most composers would have done this by using a lot of percussion instruments. However, although two players are needed for the timpani, there are not many other percussion instruments. Instead, the whole orchestra becomes a kind of percussion instrument. Also, the music often sounds like Russian folkmusic.
"The Rite of Spring" uses a very large orchestra with some unusual instruments. Here is a list of the instruments used:





Nijinsky's choreography was thought almost as shocking as the music. The idea is: a tribe sacrifices a young virgin each year in the Spring to please their gods, and make sure crops grow well. The dancers adopt a pigeon-toed stance (position); their moves are heavy. They move together in groups; their movements are like a ritual. They look like a primitive tribe performing a ritual. The ritual moves towards the sacrifice of the girl. The Rite of Spring is a link between classical ballet and Modern dance.

Nijinsky's choreography has not been kept very well, but there have been efforts in recent years to reconstruct his performance, using costumes and set designs that look like the original ones from 1913.

The "Rite of Spring" was made even more popular when Walt Disney used some of the music in his film "Fantasia" in 1940. It is used in the film to describe early life on planet earth with dinosaurs roaming about.

Recapitulation theory

The theory of recapitulation is often known as ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.

It was an idea of Étienne Serres in 1824–26. In 1886 Ernst Haekel proposed that the embryonic development of an individual organism (its ontogeny) followed the same path as the evolutionary history of its species (its phylogeny). It is also called the biogenetic law or embryological parallelism 

It was a theory (idea) that tied evolution (the change in organisms over time) with embryology (the way organisms develop before they are born). The theory basically stated that before they are born, organisms pass through developmental stages that look like adult animals of other species, in roughly the same order that these other species split off during evolution.

Although there is something to this idea, it is no longer thought to be such a useful way to look at development.

Haeckel formulated his theory as ""Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"". Ontogeny is the steps an organism takes in its development before it is born, starting as a single cell and ending as a baby. Phylogeny is the steps a species takes in its development, starting as a very simple organism and evolving into the current organism. "Recapitulates" is a synonym for "reflects" and implies that the ontogeny of an organism is similar to the phylogeny of its species.

For example, Haeckel realized that before they are born, there is a time when humans have slits in their necks. These slits look like the gills on adult fishes. Haeckel took this to mean that some time before our species became human, we were fish-like. This view is supported by the fossil record and other evidence. As the unborn human gets closer to being born, it develops a tail. In fact, some human babies are even born with tails. Haeckel concluded, again correctly, that at some time in humanities more recent evolutionary past (after we had gone through our fish stage) the species that would go on to become humans had a tail.

However, not all of Haeckels evidence or conclusions were this good. Haeckel produced several embryo drawings that often overemphasized similarities between embryos of related species. These found their ways into many biology textbooks, and into popular knowledge, even though they were wrong. Furthermore, Haeckel used this "evidence" to conclude that white people were evolutionary superior to people of other races. Not only is this a racist view, but we know today that it is not true.

Today, scientists think that Haeckel overstated the case. For example, the "gills" of a developing human do not work (though Haekel never said they did). Furthermore, as better observations were made, it was discovered that developing babies don't look exactly like the pictures Haeckel drew. He may have exaggerated what he saw in order to support his point better. Also, Haekel's discussion was entirely about morphology: he did not discuss the evolution and development of animal behaviour.

However, this is not to say that nothing about the theory makes sense. It is true that our ontogeny gives clues about our phylogeny. However, the relationship is not nearly as direct as Haeckel said it was. In fact, Haekel's over-emphatic claims led in due course to over-emphatic rejections.

Today, scientists agree that some parts of Haeckel's theory still make sense. For example:

Mount Tambora

Mount Tambora (8°14’41”S, 117°59’35”E) is a volcano in Indonesia. It is also the tallest mountain in Indonesia. When it erupted in 1815, it was the most destructive volcanic eruption in modern history. It has been estimated that it was four times larger than the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, between Java and Sumatra, in terms of volume of magma ejected. The eruption killed as many as 92,000. It also destroyed a small Asian culture, known to archaeologists as the Tamboran kingdom. It launched 100 cubic kilometers of ash into the upper atmosphere, which caused 1816 to be the "year without a summer."

Wantage is connected to Oxford, Didcot, Abingdon and Faringdon by regular bus services. The fastest public bus journey from Wantage to Oxford takes about 45 minutes, the slowest can take over 1 hour 15 minutes. 

King Alfred the Great was born here in the 9th century. Wantage appears in the Domesday Book of 1086. Its value was £61 and it was in the king's ownership until 1190. Troops of the king were stationed in Wantage during the English Civil War.

Since 1848, Wantage has been home to the Community of Saint Mary the Virgin, one of the largest communities of Anglican nuns in the world.

The sage (also called wise old man or "Senex") is a character who often appears in literature and mythology. He is an old man who is very wise. In times of trouble people go to ask the sage for advice. The sage is a very calm, intelligent old man. He is like a father-figure or grandfather-figure. He gives sensible advice or judgment.

In some stories the sage is seen as"foreign" in some way, that is, he is different from the other people of that culture. Merlin is a good example of this, as he was only half human.

The psychologist Carl Jung called him a "senex". This is Latin for old man. Jung sees him as someone who realizes that the young person is going to be the hero of the story, and he himself is just an advisor.

Mohammed Omar

Mullah Mohammed Omar () is the leader of the Taliban in Afghanistan. His name is often shortened to "Mullah Omar". Between 1996 and 2001, he was Afghanistan's de facto head of state. Three states officially recognised him under the title of "Head of the Supreme Council". He was born around the year 1959 in Nodeh, near Kandahar. He held the title Commander of the Faithful from the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

The United States has put him on their most wanted list. They believe he sheltered Osama bin Laden, and some of his al Quaeda group, directly before and after they supposedly committed the September 11 attacks. He is believed to be directing the Taliban in their war against Hamid Karzai's Government and foreign NATO troops in Afghanistan from Pakistan.

Despite his political rank, and his high status on the FBI's wanted list, not much is publicly known about Omar. There are very few photos of him. None of these photos is official. A picture that was used by the media in 2002, shows another Taliban official, but not Omar. It is also debated how authoritative the images that exist really are. 

Omar seems to be missing one eye. Other than this, people have described him in different ways: Some who have met him say he is tall, others describe him as small and frail. He has been described as shy and untalkative with foreigners. 

When he was Emir of Afganistan, Omar stayed in Kandahar most of the time and rarely met outsiders. He sent his Foreign Minister, Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, to represent him, on most occasions.

Euptoieta claudia

The Variegated Fritillary (Euptoieta claudia) is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae. It is native to North America and South America. The Variegated Fritillary is closely related to butterflies in the genus "Speyeria". It has some differences from "Speyeria" butterflies. Some of the differences are: Variegated Fritillaries have 2-3 broods per year vs. one per year in "Speyeria". They travel more vs. staying in the same place. And they use a wide range of host plants vs. just violets. Variegated Fritillaries use passionflowers as a host plant. Because of this, Variegated Fritillaries have taxonomic links to the heliconians. Their flight is low and fast, and they are hard to approach. Its genus name was taken from the Greek word "euptoietos" meaning "easily scared".

The upper side of the wings is orange and black. The fore wing and hind wing have a row of submarginal black spots and black median lines running across the wings. (Submarginal means just inward of the wing edge. Median means through the center of the wing.) The underside of the fore wing is orange. The hind wing is mottled with browns and grays. There is a pale postmedian band (postmedian means just outward of the median). There is no silvering. The wingspan is 1.75-2.25 inches.

There is a butterfly similar to the Variegated Fritillary. It is the Mexican Fritillary ("Euptoieta hegesia"). The Mexican Fritillary is brighter orange. The upper side of its hind wing has more orange. The underside of its wings is plainer, with no submarginal spots or median black lines. 

This species may be seen flying from April-October in the south. It flies in the north from summer to early fall. 

This butterfly is found in different kinds of habitats. It can by found in clover fields, alfalfa fields, fields, pastures, waste areas, roadsides, and mountain meadows. 

The Variegated Fritillary has been seen on different kinds of flowers. Here is a list of them:


Females lay their eggs singly on the host plant's leaves and stems. The eggs are pale green or cream colored. The caterpillar eats the leaves, flowers, and stems of the food plant. The caterpillar is red with black stripes. There are white spots in the black stripes. In many individuals, the white is more noticeable than the black. It has six rows of black spines. It has a pair of long, clubbed spines on the head. The chrysalis is shiny white with small black spots. It has a variable amount of brown markings and has orange and gold projections. Adults overwinter in the south and fly north each spring and summer. It has 2-3 broods per year.

Here is a list of host plants that the Variegated Fritillary caterpillar eats:

Carom billiards

Carom billiards, sometimes called carambole billiards or simply carambole (and sometimes used as another word for a game called "straight rail") are a family of billiards games played on cloth-covered tables. In these games, the players strike heavy balls with sticks called cues. Carom billiards tables have no pockets or opening where balls are sunk, that snooker and pool tables do have. In its simplest form, the object of carom billiards games is to score points or "counts" by bouncing one's own ball, called a cue ball, off of the other two balls on the table. The date the first carom game was invented is not exactly known. Also, how exactly the games developed and which game was first is not clear. However, carom billiards games are believed to have started sometime in the 18th-century (the 1700s) in France in Europe.

There are many different games, each with distinct rules, strategies and objects of play, that are all part of carom billiards. Some of the most well known games are "straight rail", "cushion caroms", "balkline", "three-cushion billiards" and "artistic billiards". There are many other carom billiards games that combine aspects of these games, but that are not as well known. For example, the "champion's game" was a short-lived game that developed during a period between the invention of straight rail and the invention of balkline. Other games are combinations of these games and other games played on tables "with pockets" (pool or snooker games), such as "English billiards" played on a snooker table and its related games, "American four-ball billiards", and "cowboy pool", played on a pool table.

The word "carom" means any strike and bounce off something. It started being used to describe the pocketless billiard games in the 1860s. It is a shortening of the word "carambola", used in Spanish and Portuguese and spelled "carambole" in French. Carambola was earlier used to describe just the red ball used in billiards games, but later was given to the game itself. Some people who study word origins suggest that "carambola" was originally the name of a yellow-to-orange colored, tropical Asian fruit, known in Portuguese as a "carambola". This was taken from an earlier word, "karambal", from the Marathi language of India, also known as starfruit. The accuracy of the fruit origin has been questioned. It has been said to be just a legend, because the fruit does not look very similar to the big red ball that is used in carom games, and there is no direct proof for the fruit explanation.

Cloth has been used to cover billiards tables since the 15th century (1400s). In fact, the company that became the most famous maker of billiard cloth, Iwan Simonis, was formed in 1453. Most cloth made for carom billiards tables is a type of cloth called "baize" that is dyed green in color, and is made from 100% wool that has fibers that are made to be very straight (a process called ). Baize cloth provides a very fast surface allowing the balls to travel easily across the table material, called a "bed". The green color of cloth was originally chosen to look similar to grass. Green has been the common cloth color since the 16th century (1500s). However, the color also serves a useful function. Human eyes more easily see green than any other color. This allows players to keep playing for longer periods of time without straining their eyes.

Modern billiard balls are made from "phenolic resin", which is a type of very strong plastic. The size of carom billiards balls is normally 61.5 mm (2⁄ in) in diameter. They weigh between 205 and 220 grams (7.23 – 7.75 ounces; 7.5 is average), and are quite a bit larger and heavier than the balls used for pool games. While UMB, the International Olympic Committee-recognized world carom billiards authority, permits balls as small as 61.0 mm (approximately 2⁄), no major manufacturer produces such balls any longer, and the main standard is 61.5 mm. The three standard balls in most carom billiards games are a completely white cue ball, a second cue ball sometimes having a red or black dot on it (to help people in telling the balls apart), and a third, red ball. In some sets of balls, however, the second cue ball is solid yellow. Both types of ball sets are allowed in tournament play.

Billiard balls have been made from many different materials since the start of the game. For example, they have been made from clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including celluloid, Bakelite, crystalate, and phenolic resin) and even steel. The most common substance from 1627 until the early- to mid-twentieth century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental reasons but based on how expensive they were and fear of danger for elephant hunters. The search was made more enticing when a New York billiard table maker offered a $10,000 prize for a substitute material. The first usable substitute was made from a material called "celluloid". Celluloid, which is an early form of plastic, was invented by a man named John Wesley Hyatt in 1868. There was a problem with the material though. Celluloid was unstable and highly flammable, sometimes exploding when people were making it.

The stick used to hit billiard balls, called a billiards cue, is different in some ways from the typical pool cue. Compared with pool cues, billiard cues are often shorter, with a shorter end cap (called a ferrule), a fatter bottom portion where the back hand grips the stick (called a butt), a wooden screw in the middle rather than one of metal or plastic, and a smaller tip diameter. These features make the billiard cue stiffer. This stiffness helps players in striking the larger and heavier billiard balls as compared with pool balls. The stiffness also acts to reduce an effect called "deflection" (sometimes called "squirt"). Deflection is an undesirable effect from the use of sidespin. Sidespin is spin placed on a ball by striking it not at its center but off to one side of its center, causing it to spin as it travels down the table. Deflection causes a ball to travel not in a straight line in the direction it was struck.

Underneath the cloth of billiard tables is a very hard rock called slate. The slate bed of a billiard table is often heated to about 5 °C/9 °F above room temperature, which helps to keep moisture out of the cloth to aid the balls rolling and rebounding in a consistent manner, and generally makes a table play faster. A heated table is required under international carom rules and is an important requirement for the games of three-cushion billiards and artistic billiards. Heating table beds is an old practice. Queen Victoria of England (1819–1901) had a billiard table that was heated using zinc tubes, At that time, though, the reason for the heating was different. The heat was used to keep ivory balls from going out of shape (warping). The first use of electric heating was for a tournament in the game of "18.2 balkline", that was held in December 1927 between two players: Welker Cochran and Jacob Schaefer, Jr. "The New York Times" announced it with fanfare: "For the first time in the history of world's championship balkline billiards a heated table will be used ..."

Straight rail, sometimes called carom billiards, straight billiards, the three-ball game, the carambole game, and the free game in Europe, is thought to date to the 1700s. No exact time of origin is known though. It was called French caroms, French billiards or the French game in early times, taking those old names from the French who made the game popular. The object of straight rail is simple: one point, called a "count", is scored each time a player's cue ball makes contact with both object balls (the second cue ball and the third ball) on a single strike of the cue ball. Winning is achieved by reaching a certain number of points, agreed to between the players to be the winning number.

When straight rail was first invented there was no on the way points were scored. However, the technique of "crotching", meaning to have two balls right next to each other on the area of one of the table's four corners where the rails meet—the "crotch"—made scoring a lot easier. This resulted in an 1862 rule which allowed only three counts before at least one ball had to be sent away from the corner in order to legally score another point. Techniques continued to develop which increased counts greatly despite the crotching ban. One of these techniques is called "nursing", and made scoring much easier. A "nurse" is a series of shots where the balls are kept very close together, allowing a player to score off of them with very soft strokes without changing their positions much, so the scoring can continue. The most important of these nurse techniques, called the "rail nurse", involves the balls down a rail, moving them just a few centimeters on each score and keeping them close together and positioned at the end of each stroke in the same or near the same arrangement so that the rail nurse can be repeated.

Professional straight rail in the United States was only seen for six years, from 1873 to 1879. It was followed by a game designed to reduce the use of the rail nurse so that spectators would not be bored by watching it. Today, straight rail play is not very common in the U.S. but it still popular in Europe, where it is thought to be a good practice game for balkline and three-cushion billiards. Europe hosts professional competitions, known as "pentathlons" after the ancient Greek Olympic competitions, in which straight rail is one of five billiards games at which players compete. The other four are called 47.1 balkline, cushion caroms, 71.2 balkline and three-cushion billiards.

A new game appeared in 1879, called the champion's game or limited-rail. The champion's game is considered an in-between game—between straight rail and balkline—and was designed to stop the rail nurse. The game uses diagonal lines—balklines—drawn at the table's corners to indicate that if balls were inside those lines, points could not be scored, thus "cutting off four triangular spaces in the four corners, [taking] away 28 inches [711 mm] of the 'nursing' surface of the end rails and 56 inches [1422 mm] on the long rails." Despite its differences from straight rail, the champion's game only expanded the areas of the table where many points in a row could be scored before the balls had to be moved to a new position. This was not sufficient to stop nursing.

Balkline came after the champion's game. It added more rules to stop nursing techniques. There are many varieties of balkline, but all divide the table into marked regions called "balk spaces". The balk spaces define areas of the surface of the table where a player may only score up to a certain number of points while the object balls are within that region.

In the balkline games, rather than drawing balklines a few inches from the corners as was done in the champion's games, the entire table is divided into rectangular spaces. This is done by drawing balklines a certain distance across the length and the width of the table. The lines are drawn a number of inches parallel from each rail. This divides the table into eight rectangular areas called "balk spaces". Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called "anchor spaces". The anchor spaces were added to the game to stop nursing techniques that developed especially for the challenges of balkline without them. 

Generally, the differences between one balkline game and another are defined by two different things: 1) where the balkines are drawn on the table, and 2) the number of points that are allowed in each balk space before at least one ball must leave that region of the table. Balkline games are named by giving two numbers that tell us about the spacing used and how many points can be scored in the balk spaces. The first number tells us how many inches from the rail the balkine will be drawn. The second number after a "dot", indicates the number of points that can be scored in the balk spaces before the balls must leave it (that number is always either one or two). So, for example, the name "18.2 balkline", tells us that balklines are drawn distant from each rail, and only two points are allowed in a balk space before a ball must leave that area.

Over its history balkline has had many variations including 8.2, 10.2, 12.2, 13.2, 12½.2, 14.1, 14.2, 18.1, 18.2, 28.2, 38.2, 39.2, 42.2, 45.1, 45.2, 47.1, 47.2, 57.2 and 71.2 balkline. In its different forms, balkline was the main carom game played from 1883 to the 1930s. After that, other carom games became more popular. This is especially true of three-cushion billiards. Balkline is not very common in the U.S., but remains popular in Europe and the Far East.

Cushion caroms, sometimes called by its original name, the indirect game, is thought to have developed in the 1820's in Britain, it developed out of an older game called the "doublet game", that dates to at least 1807. The game is sometimes incorrectly called "one-cushion" or "one-cushion billiards", which is the direct translation of its name into English from various other languages such as Spanish (""una banda"") and German (""einband""). 

The object of cushion caroms is to score "cushion caroms", meaning a bounce off of both of the other balls on the table, with at least one rail of the table being struck by the cue ball before the contact with second object ball. Cushion caroms was not played for a number of years, but came back in the late 1860s. Its return was for similar reasons as to why balkline developed. It was frustration of many people with straight rail. The techniques such as nursing that were invented to make scoring much easier, also made the game very boring to watch. Thus, as straight rail lost popularity, cushion caroms was for a time. Cushion caroms is rarely played in the U.S., but it still has some popularity in Europe.

In three-cushion billiards, sometimes called three-cushion carom, three-cushion, three-cushions, three-rail, rails and the angle game, the object is to carom off both object balls with at least three rails being contacted before the contact of the cue ball with the second object ball. Arising sometime in the 1870s, the origin of three-cushion billiards is not entirely known. It is undisputed that the Internal Revenue Collector of the Port of St. Louis, Wayman C. McCreery, made the game popular. At least one publication states he invented the game as well.

The first three-cushion billiards tournament took place January 14–31, 1878 in C. E. Mussey's Room in St. Louis, with McCreery taking part. The tournament was won by New Yorker Leon Magnus. The high run for the tournament was just 6 points, and the high average a .75. The game was infrequently played prior to 1907, with many top carom players of the era saying they did not enjoy it. However, in 1907 after the introduction of the Lambert Trophy, the game became more popular in the U.S. and internationally.

By 1924 three-cushion had become so popular that two very well know players in other billiard areas agreed to play each other in it at a challenge match. On September 22, 1924 Willie Hoppe (last name rhymes with "poppy"), the world balkline champion and Ralph Greenleaf, the world pocket billiards (pool) title holder, played a well-advertised, multiple-day, 600-point match. Hoppe was the eventual winner with a final score of 600–527. The game's decline in the U.S. came about in 1952 when Hoppe, then 51-time billiards champion, announced his retirement. 
Three-cushion billiards is a very difficult game. Averaging one point per turn at the table is professional-level play, and averaging 1.5 to 2 is world-class play. An average of one means that for every turn at the table, a player makes one point and misses once. This means that the player makes a point on only 50% of his or her shots. The highest run at three-cushion billiards for many years was 25, set by the American Willie Hoppe in 1918 during an exhibition. As of 2007, the high run record is 31 points, shared between Semih Saygıner of Turkey and Hugo Patiño who is originally from Colombia but resides in the U.S. The best game at the standard 50 points in a tournament is 9 innings by the Swedish player, Torbjörn Blomdahl in 2000, and 4 innings (count: 19-11-9-11) by Korean and U.S. national champion, Sang Lee in September 1992 in a game at SL Billards in Queens, New York. The highest tournament average is 2.536 by Dick Jaspers from the Netherlands in 2002 at a tournament in Monaco. Raymond Ceulemans from Belgium has won an unmatchable 21 three-cushion billiards world-championships.

Three-cushion billiards is the most popular carom billiards game played in the U.S. today, where pocket billiards (pool) is far more widespread. Three-cushion retains great popularity in parts of Europe, Asia, and Latin America.

The principal governing body of the sport is the Union Mondiale de Billard (UMB). That organization has been holding world three-cushion championships since the late 1920s. Decades later, the Billiards World Cup Association (BWA) competed with UMB, but faded in the late 1990s due to financial problems.. The International Olympic Committee-recognized World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA) cooperates with the UMB to keep their rulesets consistent.

In Artistic billiards, sometimes called fantasy billiards or fantaisie classique, players compete at performing 76 planned shots, each assigned a degree of difficulty. Each set shot has a maximum point value assigned for perfect execution, ranging from a 4-point maximum for lowest level difficulty shots, and climbing to an 11-point maximum for shots deemed highest in difficulty level. There is a total of 500 points available to a player. The governing body of the sport is the Confédération Internationale de Billard Artistique (CIBA).

Each shot in an artistic billiards match is played from a well-defined starting position. In fact, in some tournaments the balls must be placed within two millimeters of a diagrammed position. Each shot must also be done in an established manner in order for points to be awarded. Players are allowed three attempts at each shot. In general, the 76 shots in the game—even the lowest difficulty 4-point shots—require a high degree of skill, much practice and specialized knowledge to perform.

World title competition first started in 1986 and required the use of ivory balls. However, this requirement was dropped in 1990. The highest score ever achieved in world competition was 374, by the Frenchman Jean Reverchon in 1992. The highest score in competition overall is 427 set by Belgian Walter Bax on March 12, 2006 at a competition held in Deurne, Belgium, beating his own previous record of 425. The game is played mostly in western Europe, especially in France, Belgium and the Netherlands.

A narcotic is a drug that causes a loss of feeling, or paralysis. The name "narcotic" was probably first used by the Greek physician Galen. Galen listed mandrake root or poppy juice among the main examples for such substances.

Today, the word "narcotic" is mainly used for illegal drugs, which do not necessarily have these properties. Marijuana and cocaine are considered to be narcotics, even they do not have the medical properties described.

Set construction

Set construction means building the scenery for the performance of a play in a theatre or for the filming of a movie or a television programme.

There are several stages in the building of a set and, for a large project, many people may be needed. The set designer has to design the set. A model will be built to show what the set will look like. Drawings are made. 

The technical director or production manager will look at the designs and decide whether they are what he wants and whether there is enough money to built it. Then a master carpenter will tell the people who work for him what they have to do. There will be carpenters, plasterers, welders, painters and, perhaps, several other craftsmen.

The Firebird

The Firebird is a ballet with music by Igor Stravinsky. It was written in 1910 and choreographed by Michel Fokine. The story of the ballet is based on a well-known Russian folktale “The Firebird”. The ballet is also known by its French title "L'Oiseau de Feu".

The music was first performed as a ballet by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in Paris on 25 June 1910 conducted by Gabriel Pierné. Stravinsky was asked to write the ballet by the impresario Diaghilev. Before that, Diaghilev had asked the Russian composer Anatoly Lyadov to write it, but Lyadov seems to have been too lazy to start work on it, so Stravinsky was asked instead.

The story is about Prince Ivan, who climbs into the garden of the immortal and evil Kashchei. He sees a magic bird flying in the garden. He catches it. The Firebird asks him to let him go, promising the prince that she will do anything to help him if he gives him his freedom. Ivan lets the bird go, but takes a magic feather from the bird’s tail.

Twelve princesses with their Tsarevna (daughter of the Tsar) come into the garden and dance. They are in the power of Kashchei. Prince Ivan falls in love with the Tsarevna. The next day he asks Kashchei whether he can marry her. Kashchei is angry and sends his magic creatures after the prince. Kashchei is about to turn him to stone, when the Prince waves his feather. The Firebird appears, and comes to the prince’s rescue. She puts a magic spell on the animals and they dance. Then they all fall asleep. When Kashchei wakes up the Firebird forces him to dance. While he is dancing the Firebird tells Ivan that Kashchei’s soul lies in an egg. Ivan smashes the egg. Kashchei loses his power, the creatures and the palace. The princesses wake up and the Prince marries the Tsarevna.

The ballet is 50 minutes long. Stravinsky arranged some of the music into shorter suites so that they could be played by an orchestra at concerts (without the dancing). He did this three times: in 1911, 1919 and 1945. Each suite is a little different. The 1919 version is the one most often heard, while the 1945 is the longest as it has most of the ballet music in it.

<doc id="201936" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=201936" title="Instinct">
Instinct

Animals with nervous systems are born with instincts. An instinct is a part of the behaviour of an organism. It is inherited (innate), not learned. However, the term does not include the operation of sense organs, and does not include the normal working of the autonomic nervous system. Instincts are to do with visible muscular action in response to releasers. Releasers are triggers which set off chains of instinctive behaviour. Although instincts are not learned, in some cases their performance can be improved by experience and practice.

There are some problems with the term 'instinct'. It can be used loosely to mean a general tendency, such as "a man's instinct is to protect his family". It can be used to describe chains of behaviour of mixed origin. Properly, it is used only of well-defined acts whose causation is inherited, and which are triggered by specific stimuli called releasers. 

Other terms for instinct are fixed action patterns (FAP) and innate behaviour chains.

Instinctive behaviours can be variable and responsive to the environment. Any behaviour is instinctive if it is performed without being based upon prior experience, that is, in the absence of learning. Sea turtles, newly hatched on a beach, will automatically move toward the ocean. A joey climbs into its mother's pouch upon being born. Honeybees communicate by dance the direction of a food source without formal instruction. Other examples include animal fighting, animal courtship behaviour, internal escape functions, and building of nests.

Reflex actions are a special case. A true reflex is distinguished from other behaviours by mechanism; they do not go through the brain. Rather, the stimulus travels to the spinal cord and the message is then transmitted back through the body, tracing a path called the reflex arc. Reflexes are similar to fixed action patterns, but a fixed action pattern can be processed in the brain as well. A male stickleback's instinctive aggression towards anything red during his mating season is such an example. Examples of instinctive behaviours in humans include many of the primitive reflexes, such as rooting and suckling, behaviours which are present in most mammals.

Some instinctive behaviors depend on maturational processes to appear. For instance, we commonly refer to birds "learning" to fly. However, young birds have been experimentally reared in devices that prevent them from moving their wings until they reached the age at which their cohorts were flying. These birds flew immediately and normally when released, showing that their improvement resulted from neuromuscular maturation and not true learning.

While fixed action patterns and reflexes are clear examples of almost entirely instinctive behaviours, most behaviours are complex and consist of both instinctive and learned components. For instance, in imprinting a bird has a sensitive period during which it learns who its mother is. Konrad Lorenz famously had a goose imprint on his boots. Thereafter the goose would follow whomever wore the boots. The identity of the goose's mother was learned, but the goose's behavior towards the boots was instinctive. Similarly, sleeping in humans is instinctive, but how much and when one sleeps is clearly subject to environmental factors. Whether a behaviour is instinctive or learned is common subject of nature versus nurture debates.

In a situation when two instincts contradict each other, an animal may resort to a displacement activity ("q.v.").

Instinct is a built-in need to do something. It's not something an animal thinks about; it's something it does automatically. A baby bird automatically throws its head back, opens its mouth wide, and screams for food. It is an instinct. Baby bats automatically cling to the cave wall. Grasshoppers naturally spit out the things in their stomach on predators that try to eat them. Bees naturally work to take care of the hive and make honey. Butterflies inherit preferences for laying their eggs on certain plants.plant their young need to eat, and that's where they lay their eggs. Animals are born with these instincts, and they follow their instincts without conscious thought.

Organisms have two ways they can get behaviours. One way is learn, by observation, and by repeating things which have a pleasant outcome. The other way is to inherit the behaviour pattern by heredity.

Petrushka

Petrouchka or Petrushka is a ballet with music by the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky. It was written for Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes in 1911. It was first performed in Paris at the Théâtre du Chatelet on 13 June 1911 with the conductor Pierre Monteux, with choreography by Mikhail Fokine and sets by Alexandre Benois.

"Petrushka" is a story of a Russian traditional puppet. He is made of straw. Inside, his body is just sawdust. The puppeteer brings the puppet to life and gives it human feelings.

At the first performance the role of Petrushka was danced by Vaslav Nijinsky. Many of the audience found the music quite modern to listen to. There were unusual rhythms and strange harmonies. For example: the two chords of C major and F sharp major are often heard together. This is bitonality (two keys at once) . It is a short ballet, about 40 minutes long.

In 1921, Stravinsky arranged three of the dances from his ballet for piano solo. It is extremely difficult to play. It was written for the great pianist Arthur Rubinstein ..
In 1947 Stravinsky made changes to the ballet music, using a smaller orchestra. 

The action takes place on Admiralty Square in the Russian town of St Petersburg. The Shrovetide fair (called "Maslenitsa" in Russian) is in full swing. It is a Russian carnival. The people are enjoying themselves before a period of fasting.

The bustle of the crowd are described very well in Stravinsky’s music. An organ grinder and two dancing girls entertain the crowd. The music is a popular French song "Une Jambe de Bois". The drums then play a loud roll to announce the entry of the puppeteer or Charlatan (someone who cheats by getting money in a dishonest way). When the curtain rises we see a tiny theatre. The Charlatan introduces the puppets which have no life. They just hang limp in his hands. The three puppets are: Petrushka, a Ballerina, and a Moor.

The Charlatan plays a tune on his flute and the puppets come to life. They dance a lively Russian dance.

We then see Petrushka in his dark cell. The Charlatan kicks Petrushka into this miserable cell. Petrushka is treated very badly. He is very unhappy. The Charlatan is cruel because he gave Petrushka feelings, and then made him miserable. Petroushka hates the Charlatan and is in love with the Ballerina. Petrushka shakes his fist at the portrait of the Charlatan which hangs on the wall. He tries to escape from the cell but he cannot do so.

The Ballerina comes into the room. Petrushka wants to show his love for her, but the Balllerina does not want him and leaves.

In the third scene, we see that the Moor has a much better life than Petrushka. The Moor has a nice, large room with bright colours. He lies on a divan and plays with a coconut, trying to cut it with his scimitar. When he cannot do it, he thinks the coconut must be a god and so he prays to it.

The Charlatan puts the Ballerina in the Moor’s room. The Ballerina thinks the Moor is handsome. She plays a tune on a toy trumpet (played by a cornet in the original 1911 version) and dances with the Moor. 

Petrushka has managed to break out of his cell. He interrupts the Ballerina and the Moor. Petrushka is madly jealous and attacks the Moor, but soon realizes he is too small and weak. The Moor beats Petrushka. Petrushka runs for his life, with the Moor chasing him, and escapes from the room.

The fourth and final scene goes back to the carnival scene. It is early evening. Several people each perform a dance: the wet-nurse, the peasant dancing with a bear and some gypsies, coachmen, grooms and masqueraders. 

Suddenly Petrushka rounds out into the crowd, followed by the Moor with his sword. The Moor catches him and kills him.

The police come and question the Charlatan because they think he may be responsible for the murder of Petroushka.. The Charlatan shows everyone that Petrushka is only a puppet by holding the "corpse" above his head and shaking it.

It is night, the crowd leave. The Charlatan leaves, carrying Petrushka’s body. Suddenly he sees the ghost of Petrushka on the roof, mocking him. The Charlatan is terrified and runs away.

The audience is left to wonder whether Petrushka is real or not.

Black-body radiation

Black-body radiation is radiation produced by heated objects, particularly from a kind of special object that is made so it will absorb all radiation (visible light, infrared light, ultraviolet light, etc.) that falls on it, and so that it will also radiate at all frequencies that heat energy produces in it.

This part of the story of radiation was first explained by James Clerk Maxwell via wave theory but the predicted and actual intensity vs. frequency curves did not go together right. Because the way of classical physics did not work, Max Planck explained their relationship by saying that there are individual things (he did not try to guess what kind of things) that vibrate, each at its own frequency. Each wave of each frequency has its own special energy level. A single x-ray is very high energy and can go right through the human body. A single wave of infrared light is very low energy, cannot go through the human body, and can only warm it. Plank's good thinking was to realize that in order to get a single wave at the x-ray frequency, it was necessary to have a big enough package of energy (or "quantum") to make such a strong wave. So if a black-body took in a single wave at the x-ray frequency, then it could give off an x-ray at some later time. But if the black-body only took in infra-red light it would not matter how much of it was absorbed. It could only give off infra-red light and could not give off even ordinary red light, much less any higher energy light such as ultraviolet light or x-ray radiation. Planck said that the total energy given off by a black-body at any particular frequency is equal to the number of the "vibrating things" (see above), n, that were vibrating at a given frequency, f times a special constant, h, that turns frequency units into energy units. The equation is:
The constant he made, h, is called the Planck constant.

The idea that a unit of light at a given frequency always has the same energy, the idea that there is a quantum of energy for each unit of light at a given frequency, became the doorway into quantum mechanics, so the idea of a black-body is something that is basic to modern physics. It shows up in discussions of a wide variety of physics topics having to do with energies and frequencies.

Sputnik 1

Sputnik 1 was the first man-made satellite to go around the Earth. It was made by the Soviet Union. It was launched on 4 October 1957 at Baikonur Cosmodrome. It orbited (went around) the Earth for three months. It did 1,440 orbits of the Earth during this time. It went down into Earth's atmosphere on 4 January 1958 and burned up.

The United States was very surprised when the Soviet Union sent Sputnik 1 into space. It did not want to fall behind. So, it began spending more money on science and education. This was when the Space Race between the Soviet Union and the United States began.

The word "Sputnik" comes from the Russian Спутник, literally "travelling companion". It is pronounced or , not .

Netley Hospital

Netley Hospital or The Royal Victoria Hospital at Netley was finished on 19 May 1856. The plans for its building began in 1853, at the start of the Crimean War. The Medical Department of the army was totally unprepared for the very large number of wounded soldiers being brought from the battles at places like the siege of Sevastopol. It saw the first real involvement of Florence Nightingale.

Nightingale was a young and determined nurse, sent to Scutari to care for the soldiers. She began to develop sanitation and hygiene properly. The Boer War in southern Africa between 1880 and 1902 had a very high casualty rate for the British. More than 20 thousand dead and many who died from disease when they returned home. Thousands of British soldiers brought back to Netley were nearly far too many for the hospital, but others had been built by then and so they were able to deal with the number of troops. Netley’s role in World War One was very important in saving the lives of many troops. Hundreds of wooden huts were built behind the site of the Hospital, increasing the capacity of Netley to some 5000 men. This was needed especially during the Somme offensive and the battles at Ypres.

John Nicholaas "Johnny" Rep (born 25 November 1951 in Zaandam, Noord-Holland) is a former Dutch football striker. He currently holds the all time record for FIFA World Cup goals for the Netherlands with 7. He played two European Cup I finals and two World Championship finals for The Netherlands (1974 and 1978).

Rep made his debut for Ajax on 29 August 1971. He earned his nickname 'Goudhaantje (Goldcrest)' due to his ability to score decisive goals. During the return match for the Intercontinental Cup against Independiente in 1972 he scored two of the three Ajax goals. In 1973 he scored the decisive 1-0 in the European Cup I final against Italian Juventus.

In 1975 Rep left Ajax for the Spanish club Valencia CF and was superseded by Tscheu La Ling. He played two seasons at Valencia during which he scored 22 goals. The next step in his career took Rep to France where he played two seasons SC Bastia (33 goals) and four seasons for AS Saint-Etienne (44 goals). He returned to the Dutch league in 1983 to play for PEC Zwolle, Feyenoord before ending his professional player career at HFC Haarlem.

I would like to talk with Majorly about some of my recent edits but his talk page is being protected so i can't communicate with him properly.

I was a former vandal. Not a major one on en.wikipedia.org just someone messing around on a public terminal from an IP address back in 2006. However, I've learnt since then and grown up. I'm not a vandal anymore. I would like to be helpful here, but don't in all honesty know how to

I have tried to add some comments to . They are about a 'bot' that the user has written. But the page has 'view source' instead of 'change this page'. What do I need to do? () 09:11, 22 September 2009 (UTC)

This is about 'Darkicebot'. should put a statement on describing what the 'bot' is designed to do, and the rules that are used to do this. We could then see if there is a problem with the intention. We may be able to offer advice. () 09:29, 22 September 2009 (UTC)

Hi all! I know this has been proposed and turned down in the past, but I'd like to suggest the starting of Very Good Pictures (equivalent to FPs at enwp). Last time around, the main concern was that the pics were not "ours", they "belonged to commons". Well, even at enwp, all FPs are free use and a majority of them are from Commons. I think this will generate interest among our editors and readers. If we start something like "Picture of the day", then it'll be a nice change to our Main Page. Yes, I accept that we must concentrate on article building, but then, very small projects have this feature, so I think we can start this. Regards, 10:51, 21 September 2009 (UTC)

I'm thinking of writing a bot to create redirects. Information is at . Please leave comments there. 22:03, 24 September 2009 (UTC)

Remember ?? Well, apparently, he seems to have remorse for his actions. Before you ask, no, I'm not him, nor was I recruited here by him. (also, he was about 15-16 when he started his vandalism with friends at high school, he's now 19, and in a year from now, well, he's 20!)

He's admitted to me privately he's been an idiot, and f***ed up the sites, but now finds vandalism boring. He said when he found a vandalised article on something he liked
(Liverpool F.C.) it stopped him from doing it, and gave him a reality check.

I'm not asking for an unban, just explaining. He is "emotionally different". As for his choice of username, well, it "was" plagiarism (and the owner of the website with that name has forgiven him for it), but he's decided to move on now. I'm here to edit some other stuff and so am not singlepurpose account.

Anyway, that's my speech over and done with. Apologies for his behaviour, yes, he is emotionally different, but he's now found other outlets for if he gets pent-up anger/energy and has realized a wiki is not for that. He now wants to be a "proper editor", if there's such a thing. Kurt aka -- () 19:21, 26 September 2009 (UTC)

Hello,

does anybody know if Miszabot allows to "pin" certain discussions, so they don't get archived; I just cleared "Any point" (3 times in the archive, not cleared here); I am unsure whether this is a bug, or intentional, though.

Just a quick note, help appreciated.-- () 22:09, 24 September 2009 (UTC)

I would like to become a part of the Wiki community, but it seems most of you speak 
a different language...I've worked through the tutorials and still feel lost. Any suggestions? Should I just leave it alone altogether? I've been successful
in minor edits and things, but still feel like I'm out of the loop. I also had an article entitled "ServejesusForReal.com deleted twice, and it was an unfinished article...help! 

I've noticed a lot of incivility over the past few days and I'd like to remind all users to . I'll definitely be sending out gentle reminders from now on to users who are being downright rude to other users. No matter how annoying a user may be, please be kind (civil) and discuss the matter in a calm way. I am particularly displeased with admins who have said some very unprofessional and mean things. Its not great if this wiki to overly kind to vandals, but it's much worse if we're overly mean to each other! Vandals can be dealt with without resorting to name calling or insults. Please review if you need to. In good faith, 00:34, 3 October 2009 (UTC)
I agree with you, EhJJ. I have seen users engaging in incivility a lot, though, I won't be naming or pointing to any particular incidents as you clarify that you won't do, and because this thread is "not directed at any one in particular". — 02:54, 3 October 2009 (UTC)

Per this proposal, please have some bots move the tags on talk pages. Thanks, () 20:46, 27 September 2009 (UTC)
<-- Instead of commenting on an archived discussion I'll comment here. As anyone who looks at my contributions here and elsewhere can see I rarely use tags. However I do look at them regularly and think they can be very helpful when someone reads the article. Having problems with tags because they are repetitive or problematic in other ways is fine and needs to be looked at and fixed if possible (sometimes repetitive is unavoidable). That being said however, I seriously disagree with moving most tags on the talk page. Are there some tags that maybe could be moved there?.. maybe but I can't think of any at the moment. I read talk pages when I read articles, especially on EnWiki, because you often see more information about the subject there amid the discussions. I have a feeling however that most people do NOT. If you have the tags on the main page you are a lot more likely to have someone read the article, see the tag and work to fix the article. That of course is the whole point of the tags in the first place and I don't think expecting everyone to read the talk page for every article they read is a good assumption for us to make and would therefore almost guarantee some amount of fixes not being made that would have been in the past. I assume that the biggest problem with them on the main page is for aesthetics (how the page looks)? If that is the case then I would say aesthetics is less important then function and they should therefore stay on the page. TLDR: Important to keep on main page, looks less important then function () 23:41, 28 September 2009 (UTC)

I was under the impression we respected one another here, and that foul language was not used, and was surprised to find the language in this article was otherwise... () 15:10, 5 October 2009 (UTC)

Hello again, I may have already brought this up, the (V)GA process was one of the things that seemed to work on this wikipedia, that is until it was changed recently. Beforehand, we had a multi-stage process, with first commenting and improving the candidate, and then "voting" if it should be promoted or not. This was then changed, as we all know voting is evil, and cannot replace a discussion. Now, the process is supposedly based on consensus. I don't know about other editors, but at least I am now totally unsure about several things:
While many people seem to advocate the system of discussing rather than voting, what are the steps we can undertake to make the process more manageable?- The theaory was that any editor should be able to promote articles/close the discussions, yet judging consensus, picking the right time are skills the community ecxpects bureaucrats to have.
If we cannot get the new system to be as manageable as the old, I suggest we undo the changes and return to a system that had its (well-known) weak points, but otherwise seemed to have worked reasonably well...-- () 09:47, 3 October 2009 (UTC)

Being honest, the new system does not work. Let's go back to the old one which was good! 10:37, 3 October 2009 (UTC)
I have nothing against anything. You came here to simply state "I like the old system. It's better" which is the equivalent of saying "I like strawberry ice-cream". You then said the current system created drama and had fewer participants. I'm saying the only drama is created here by these types of discussion and the level and quality of participation in the current process is way better than before. And no, talk pages are not for "accusations", not in my world, they're used to promote useful discussion about Wikipedia and its articles. () 11:04, 3 October 2009 (UTC)

I have noticed that indef blocked sockpuppet accounts are being placed in this category, and as such are to be deleted after one month. I think this is a bad idea. The reason being, it makes sockpuppet investigations harder to do. When someone has to search and search and search for an account to compare a possible sockpuppet against when they could have easily found it by looking in the respective sockmasters category, it wastes the reporters time. Also I noticed that the wording at contradicts itself. It states: ""This category is contains userpages of indefinitely blocked users."" But then goes onto say: ""The following pages should not be in this category, and therefore shouldn't be deleted: Talkpages of indefinitely blocked users."" I am recommending that we clarify that, and remove all sockpuppet accounts from this category. 03:25, 16 October 2009 (UTC)

Following this discussion on notability of Xavier, Kansas I believe the consensus was that "all towns are notable". I view of that decision, I will remove the QD tags put on a number of US towns by . I don't believe we reached a consensus on one sentence stubs, but some one else may remember. (If we have decided to delete one sentence stubs then apologies to Razorflame and I'll delete the pages myself). -- () 06:57, 15 October 2009 (UTC)

Towns are "not" notable just for existing. That's not how Wikipedia works. We are not a directory of every place that ever existed. Articles should have some substance that's more than informing us of its existence, location and population. We should not say all of something is something, we should look at things on their own merits. 10:21, 15 October 2009 (UTC)

Perhaps, since most people think the quick deletion regulations as applied here is purely bureaucratic, why not renominate the oneline city stubs for deletion. No rules as far as I can tell about renominating things for deletion. And, from my point of view, while some people may be aware that the Wales national football team is notable, the page currently provides no to back up this . So some readers would be completely in the dark as to what makes this particular group notable. And saying "national" in the title bestows instant notability, that's simply untrue. Cheers. () 13:21, 15 October 2009 (UTC)
Ahah, I get it now. Okay, well I think there's a general agreement that the Wales (and England and Germany) national football team articles are not "one-line stubs" and need references. We're also probably in agreement that all articles should ideally be referenced, no matter how long they are. As for flooding RC, well that's why we have the flood flag. Finally, the single-sentence stubs about X city in Y county which just say "X is a city in Y", well we're all probably in agreement that they add absolutely NOTHING to this Wikipedia other than make the "Show any page" a tiresome experience. () 13:59, 15 October 2009 (UTC)
(<-) Hello there, I was the one who originally brought up the "cities in Kentucky", a few articles which read "X is a city in Kentucky". My opinion on the notability of places: A place is notable (and not up for quick deletion) if at least one applies:
Most of the cities in Kentucky (a few hundred, I think) were created by one editor; I think spending the same time on getting perhaps two or three of these cities to a decent level of coverage would have been better than a "collect them all" approach. After all, about half of the people in Kentucky live in like 10-12 cities. If someone is really interested in US geography, there are fifty states; for each state, get the state capital and the biggest/most important city of the state...-- () 16:00, 15 October 2009 (UTC)

Here is what I was thinking when I was tagging them for quick deletion: A) They fell under the A4 clause of quick deletion which states that if they don't have a claim of notability, then they can be speedily deleted and B) They were one line stubs which were not going to get expanded. They were valid quick deletion tags and if administrators are starting to not follow even the simplest of deletion policies, then I do not know what the future of this project is. People need to start looking at the facts before they start removing quick deletion tags that were valid in the first place. Stop creating unnecessary drama when you could have easily deleted them and moved on. 00:17, 16 October 2009 (UTC)

Manchukuo yuan

The Manchukuo yuan was the money used in the Empire of Manchukuo, from June 1932 until August 1945. 

The Manchukuo yuan would buy 24 grams of silver. The yuan was instead of the Chinese "tael". The tael was common and was in use in Manchuria. A tael would buy about 40 grams of silver.

The Manchukuo yuan would buy 24 grams of silver in 1932. The price of silver changed and the yuan would not buy 24 grams of silver. To show that the yuan had value it was made equal to Japanese money. The Japanese money was called the yen. In 1940 the Manchukuo yuan was being used to measure Manchukuo exports and imports to America, Germany and Japan.
The paper money was in five values in 1932. Each piece of paper money is called a note. There was a one hundred yuan note, a ten yuan note, a five yuan note, a one yuan note and a small value note. A new 1000 yuan note was made in 1944.

The paper money or notes had pictures of Chinese emperors printed on them. The money was first made in Japan. Later they were made by the Bank in the Manchukuo capital of Hsinking (Hsinking is now called Changchun). 
The Yuan was subdivided into 10 "chiao", 100 "fen" or 1000 "li". Coins were made that were worth 5 "li" and bigger values. The largest value coin was 10 "fen".

In 1944 and 1945, Manchukuo made coins of red or brown cardboard. These are a rare coins as they are not made of metal.

On January 1946 Manchukuo Yuan was replaced. The Chinese allowed people to swap 1 Manchukuo for a new type of money called a "North-Eastern Yuan". In 1948 these new yuan could be swapped by a "Gold Yuan". One Gold Yuan cost 150,000 "North Eastern Yuans".

Tropical Storm Jerry (1995)

Tropical Storm Jerry was a weak tropical storm of the very active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. Even though Jerry was weak, Jerry caused 8 deaths and $40 million in damage. Jerry made landfall in Jupiter, Florida and Dixie County, Florida. Jerry was active with four other cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean: Humberto, Iris, Luis, and Karen. Because there was not much damage, the name "Jerry" was not retired and was used again in 2001 and 2007, the name will also be used again in 2013.

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 9. Over the next week, clouds and other thunderstorms grew near the tropical wave. By August 22 it was upgraded to "Tropical Depression Eleven". Tropical Depression Eleven was located just to the north of Cuba at the time. On August 23 it became "Tropical Storm Jerry". Jerry had winds at 40 miles per hour, however the minimum pressure was not at the lowest still Jerry weakened back to a depression. The National Hurricane Center did not expect to Tropical Depression Eleven to become a tropical storm because most of the showers and thunderstorms were over land. 

On August 23, Tropical Storm Jerry made landfall in Jupiter, Florida while it was still a weak tropical storm with winds at 40 miles per hour. It stayed as a tropical storm until it went into the Gulf of Mexico. It made a second landfall in Florida of August 25 while a tropical depression. It crossed into Georgia soon after and into South Carolina. Jerry died on the border of Georgia and South Carolina on August 28. The remains of Jerry either moved to the south back over to Florida or to the east over North and South Carolina. But the remains of Tropical Storm Jerry did last for five days over the United States. 

Tropical Storm Jerry killed two people in Florida, three people in South Carolina, and three more in North Carolina. Jerry caused $19 million in damage in Florida, $10 million in South Carolina, and $11 million in North Carolina. In total, Jerry caused $40 million in damage and 8 people to be killed. This was the first time since 1990 that a name starting with the letter "J" was used. It was also only the second time that the name "Jerry" made been used to name a storm in the Atlantic. Because there was not much damage, the name "Jerry" was not retired, so it was used again in 2001 and 2007, it will also be used again in 2013.

<doc id="202619" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=202619" title="Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon">
Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon

Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (7 September 1707 – 16 April 1788), usually called Buffon, was a French naturalist. He was also a mathematician, cosmologist and encyclopedic author. 

His collected information influenced the next two generations of naturalists, including Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck and Georges Cuvier. 

Buffon published 35 volumes of his "Histoire naturelle" during his lifetime, and nine more were published after his death, for a total of 44 volumes. "Truly, Buffon was the father of all thought in natural history in the second half of the 18th century". 

Buffon held the position of Intendant (Director) of the "Jardin du Roi", now called the "Jardin des Plantes"; it is the French equivalent of Kew Gardens. The "Lycée Buffon" in Paris is named after him.

Buffon is best remembered for his "Histoire naturelle". "Written in a brilliant style, this work was read ... by every educated person in Europe". It was translated into many different languages, making him one of the most widely read authors of the day, a rival to Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Voltaire.

In the opening volumes of the "Histoire naturelle" Buffon questioned the usefulness of mathematics, criticized Carl Linnaeus's taxonomical approach to natural history, outlined a history of the Earth with little relation to the Biblical account, and proposed a theory of reproduction which ran counter to existing ideas. 

The early volumes were condemned by the Faculty of Theology at the Sorbonne. Buffon published a retraction, but he continued publishing the offending volumes without any change.
Buffon noted that despite similar environments, different regions of the world have distinct plants and animals. This observation, later known as Buffon's Law, may be the first principle of biogeography. 

Buffon understood the idea of common descent, and discussed it a number of times. This does not mean he believed in it. Probably he did not, but he discussed it fairly openly on a number of occasions. Interpreting his ideas is not simple, for he returned to topics many times in the course of his work.

In volume 14 he argued that all the world's quadrupeds had developed from an original set of just thirty-eight quadrupeds. On this basis, he is sometimes considered a "transformist" and a precursor of Darwin.

In "Les époques de la nature" (1778) Buffon discussed the origins of the solar system, speculating that the planets had been created by a comet's collision with the sun. 

He also suggested that the earth originated much earlier than the 4004 BC of Archbishop James Ussher. Basing his figures on the cooling rate of iron tested at his Laboratory le Petit Fontenet at Montbard, he calculated that the age of the earth was 75,000 years. Once again, his ideas were condemned by the Sorbonne, and again he issued a retraction to avoid further problems.

Charles Darwin wrote in his preliminary historical sketch added to the third edition of "On the Origin of Species": "Passing over... Buffon, with whose writings I am not familiar." Then, from the fourth edition onwards, he amended this to say that "the first author who in modern times has treated it [evolution] in a scientific spirit was Buffon. But as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he does not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species, I need not here enter on details." 

The paradox of Buffon is that, according to Ernst Mayr:
He was not an evolutionist, yet he was the father of evolutionism. He was the first person to discuss a large number of evolutionary problems, problems that before Buffon had not been raised by anybody... he brought them to the attention of the scientific world.
Except for Aristotle and Darwin, no other student of organisms [whole animals and plants] has had as far-reaching an influence.

He brought the idea of evolution into the realm of science.
He developed a concept of the "unity of type," a precursor of comparative anatomy.
More than anyone else, he was responsible for the acceptance of a long-time scale for the history of the earth.
He was the founder of biogeography.
And yet, he hindered evolution by his frequent endorsement of the immutability of species. He provided a criterion of species, fertility among members of a species, that was thought impregnable.

Nitride

In chemistry, a nitride is a compound of nitrogen with a less electronegative element, attached together in a specific way. Nitrides are a large class of compounds with a wide range of properties and applications.

Most of the names for nitrides follow a simple pattern: the name of the element attached to the nitrogen, then "nitride". So, GaN would be gallium nitride. 
There are some exceptions, however, for the compounds that has had a usual name before. For example, NH is not called as "hydrogen nitride", even if it is the most simple of this class of molecules, but it is continuing to be commonly ammonia.

<doc id="202665" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=202665" title="Hiram College Library">
Hiram College Library

The Hiram College Library has provided a welcoming, comfortable, and intellectually stimulating environment for many generations of students, faculty, staff, and community members. But it hasn’t always been the same place, or even in the same place, through its history. The Library has grown, added and subtracted parts, nearly been destroyed, and moved from one end of the campus to the other in its 100+ year career.

Prior to 1900, library facilities at Hiram College consisted of the small libraries of each of the student literary societies: Delphic, Hesperian, and Olive Branch. Societies usually limited access to their members, and the only common library was the college’s depository collection of federal government publications (established in 1874) that was stored in the original Hinsdale Hall. 

The Teachout-Cooley Library of Hiram College was erected in 1900 with money given by Abram Teachout. Built of brick and wood, it had two stories with a three story tower. In 1923, a supplemental gift from the Teachout family made possible an addition built to the south of the original building, and joined to it by means of a vestibule. A Greek portico entrance was added, and the size of the Library was essentially doubled. An observatory with its telescope, a gift of Lathrop Cooley, was a prominent feature of the building until 1939. The observatory was relocated to its present site on Wakefield Road thanks to the generosity of Ella M. Stephens.

The Library’s collections then consisted of those books donated by the literary 
societies and the depository collection. These were consolidated by the first Librarian 
of the college, Emma Ryder. While a student at Hiram, she was made the librarian of the
Olive Branch Society, and did such an excellent job that she was asked to organized the 
libraries of the other societies. After she graduated in 1890, she went on to study at 
the University of Chicago and Syracuse University, before returning to Hiram in 1896. 
She served as the college’s Librarian until 1907, and introduced the Dewey Decimal System to the Library. She also taught Greek and Latin, was the College Registrar and the House Mother for Miller Hall. 

The old building was largely destroyed by fire in February of 1939. In addition to thousands of books, also lost were a major portion of the files and records of Professor John S. Kenyon and the furnishings of the Vachel Lindsay Reading Room. Kenyon, a linguist, was a prominent scholar of English pronunciation and regional dialects.

But, like a phoenix, the Library rose again, and a newer, more modern building was erected with a main reading room on the lower floor and a browsing room above. The card catalog was saved from fire damage and much of the lost book collection was replaced. The west end of the browsing room was designated the Vachel Lindsay Room, and the east end as the Adelaide Robbins Rhodes Room. In 1962 this area was converted into the Geidlinger Music Room through a gift from Ms. Ella Geidlinger and Mrs. Ruth G. Sheets in memory of their sister, Charlotte Geidlinger. 

In 1948 a further addition to the south side of the Library was built, again with funds from the Teachout Foundation. Finally, a fourth addition was necessary by 1963. This expanded the building westward toward Dean Street and effectively doubled the size of the Library once again. Included were rooms for the newly planned Archives and Special Collections. It was made possible by a substantial gift from Mr. and Mrs. Harley C. Price, and the Library was renamed the Teachout-Price Memorial Library.

During the 1970s the Library came to share space with newer services, the Media Center and the Dray Computer Center, both on the lower level of the building. The Media Center became administratively incorporated into the Library. 
By the late 1980s the continued growth of the collection, the demand for more study space, and the need to incorporate new technologies led to the decision to plan for a new building. A comprehensive capital campaign by the college featured the construction of a $7.1 million facility as its centerpiece. Funding came from hundreds of contributors and friends, prominently the Kresge Foundation, however no single donor contributed enough to confer a name to the building, and so it remains the Hiram College Library. Completed in 1995, the collections, equipment, and some of the furnishings of the Library were relocated in the new building that summer. Features of the new building included space for a video studio, a redesigned Archives and Special Collections, a Library Instruction Room, group study rooms, and a multi-functional space, the Pritchard Room. 

Shortly thereafter, the Library provided access to its new online catalog, and two years later joined the OhioLINK Consortium, thereby expanding the options of our students, faculty, and staff far beyond the walls of the new building. Since then, change has been a nearly continuous process with modifications and improvements to the collections, services, and spaces of the Library becoming a yearly, monthly, and weekly affair. Among the more prominent changes since 1995 include:
• The movement of the music collections out of the Chamberlain Room, and its replacement by the Children’s Literature and Curriculum Materials Collections.
• Redesignation of the Media Center as the Center for Educational Technology (CET) and its reorganization of the CET under the auspices of the Computer Center
• Wholesale movement of collections to make room for a new reading area and music recording collections.

At this point in the Library’s history it seems safe to say that the previous paragraph will undergo regular modification as we undergo self-assessment to offer the best collections, services, and facilities possible.

Rail gauge

Rail gauge is the distance from the inside of one rail on a railroad track to the inside of the other.
Most countries use a standard gauge of 1,435 mm (4 ft, 8 1/2 in). Wider gauges are called broad gauge, smaller gauges are called narrow gauge. 
Broad gauge is usually used where the track needs to have heavy things moving on it. Narrow gauge is used to build railroads for less money, because the smaller track costs less. Places where different gauges meet are called break of gauge.

Hurricane Anita

Hurricane Anita was the only major hurricane of the inactive 1977 Atlantic hurricane season. It struck Mexico as a category 5. Though it struck as a category 5 no one knows the damage. Anita killed 11 people in Mexico.

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 16. After it moved westward for about a week, it started growing some clouds. It changed the way it was moving to the northwest on August 27 while it was over Cuba, but all clouds were over the Bahamas and Florida. The tropical wave soon crossed Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico. While it entered the Gulf of Mexico, an anticyclone made conditions good for a tropical cyclone to form. The tropical wave also moved slow when it entered the Gulf of Mexico, making it easier for it to develop. By August 29, the tropical wave was good enough to be upgraded to Tropical Depression One. 

Tropical Depression One went back on a westward path than a ridge forced it. Conditions remained good and the tropical depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Anita later on August 29. Water temperatures were warm, this allow Tropical Storm Anita to become Hurricane Anita during August 30. Hurricane Anita looked like it would strike Texas at first, but other weather systems did not allow it to do so. Anita began to quickly strengthen, it had become a category 3 hurricane on September 1. By the next day, Hurricane Anita had reached its highest winds as a category 5 hurricane, while not far from the coast of Mexico. 

Hurricane Anita stayed as a category 5 hurricane as it made landfall in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas on September 2. Anita weakened fast over land, weakening to a tropical storm over central Mexico later that day. It also weakened to a tropical depression before it reached the Pacific coast of Mexico.

The name Anita was retired. It was not replaced with anything specific because the tropical cyclone names change in 1979.

Vasa (ship)

Vasa was a big Swedish warship. The ship was built from 1626 to 1628. The same year "Vasa" was ready outside Stockholm, but sank by accident on her maiden voyage (first trip). "Vasa" sank because she was too heavy on top. Those who built her knew that she had problems, but they didn't dare say that to the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus. He was not in Sweden when "Vasa" was built and he wanted her to go fight in the Thirty Years' War as soon as possible. There was a hearing about why "Vasa" sank, but no one was found guilty or judged for her sinking.

Swedish divers in diving bells brought up some of "Vasa"'s cannons from the sunken ship in the 1660s. Anders Franzén found "Vasa" in 1956 after he had read about the ship in sources and looked for her in the water around Stockholm. The ship was brought up in 1961 and was then treated with special chemicals so that it would last for a long time. The preservation treatment took almost 20 years to complete. "Vasa" is now in the Vasa Museum in Stockholm, Sweden. It is a very popular place for tourists to visit. It gets more than one million visitors every year.

When "Vasa" was brought up there were thousands of things inside her. There were bones of people, clothes, weapons, tools, coins, food and even some of the sails. The things and "Vasa" have been very good for historians, because they helps them understand how it was in Sweden in the 1600s. "Vasa" was a very expensive ship and was one of the largest in the world. She had hundreds of sculptures, and they were painted in many colors. She was a symbol of how powerful Sweden wanted to look and how good the Swedish king was.

One-inch boy

The One-inch boy, or Issun-bōshi, is a character in a Japanese fairy tale.

The story begins with an old, childless couple who live alone. The old woman wishes for a child, even though she's old. Eventually, a son was born to them, but their son was only an inch tall. They named the miniature child Issun-bōshi. The old couple takes good care of him even though he is small. One day, Issun finds out he will never grow, so he goes on a trip to seek his place in the world. He thinks he might become a good warrior, so Issun-bōshi is given a sewing needle for a sword, a soup bowl for a boat, and chopsticks for oars.

He sails down river to the city, where he asks for a job with the government and goes to the home of a rich daimyo (lord), whose daughter is an attractive princess. They say no because he is so tiny, but give him a job entertaining the princess. While they travel together, they are attacked by a big monster that swallows Issun-boshi. The boy defeats the monster by pricking him from within with his needle/sword. The monster spits out Issun-boshi and drops a magical Uchide's Mallet as he runs away. As a reward for his bravery, the princess uses the power of the mallet to make him grow. Issun-bōshi and the princess stay friends and get married later.

Pollen tube

The pollen tube is the tube which sperm from the pollen reaches the ovary, and fertilises the plant to form seeds.

The pollen tube of most seed plants acts as a passageway. It transports sperm cells from the pollen grain, from the stigma (in flowering plants or angiosperms) to the ovules at the base of the pistil. In some gymnosperms (conifers and gnetophytes) sperms move directly through ovule tissue. In other gymnosperms (Ginkgo and cycads) the pollen tube is involved only in nutrient uptake from ovule tissue by the pollen grain, and does not convey sperm cells to the egg. Like ferns, other basal land plants, and many algae, these gymnosperms have flagellate sperm, which swim through a watery fluid to fertilize the egg cells.
In angiosperms the pollen tube germinates from the pollen grain and grows the entire length through the stigma, style, ovary and ovules to reach the eggs. In maize, this single cell can grow longer than 12 inches to traverse the length of the pistil. The sperm cells by themselves are not motile and are carried within the tube. As the tip of the tube reaches an egg it bursts and releases two sperm cells leading to a "double fertilization". One sperm unites with the egg cell to produce the embryo of a new plant, while a second sperm unites with the central cell (polar nuclei) to produce the endosperm of the seed. The endosperm is rich in starch, proteins and oils and is a major source of human food (e.g., wheat, barley, rye, oats, corn)

Kuchisake onna

The Kuchisake Onna, or split mouthed woman, is a popular figure in Japanese folklore. She even shows up in many modern day urban legends. She often appears wearing a surgical mask to cover her mouth, which has been ripped open from ear to ear. She will ask unknowing passers-by whether or not they think she is beautiful. Often they will say yes, and she will remove the mask, showing them her torn face and ask again. If the person says no, then she will rip their face so it resembles hers.

There are different rumors about how to avoid her killing you. One is to say she is average, and another is to ask her if you are beautiful, in hopes of confusing her so one could escape while she has to think about what to do next.

The stories of Kuchisake Onna came from the Heian period Japan, where there lived a very beautiful but very vain woman. Her husband thought she was being unfaithful to her, and cut her face out of jealousy.

Rook

The Rook is a member of the Crow family. The crows are a family in the Passerine order. 

The rook is similar in size to the crow. It has black feathers, which show a blue or bluish-purple sheen (glint) in bright sunlight. The feathers on the head, neck and shoulders are dense and silky. The legs and feet are generally black, and the bill (beak) is grey-black. 

Rooks differs from the crow by the bare grey-white skin around the base of the adult's bill, in front of the eyes. The feathering around the legs look shaggier and laxer than the Carrion Crow. The young bird looks just like a crow because it lacks the bare patch at the base of the bill.

Its food is mostly earthworms and insect larvae, which the bird finds by probing the ground with its strong bill. It also eats cultivated cereal grain, smaller amounts of fruit, small mammals, acorns, small birds, their eggs and young and carrion. 

Rooks "always nest together", usually in the very tops of the trees. Branches and twigs are broken off trees for the nests. There may be any number of nests together in a group of trees: twenty or thirty are often seen in the "rookery". This is why rooks are sometimes described as colonial birds.

If a user removes a comment from their own it should not be restored. By removing the comment the user has verified that they have read it. The comment is still in the page history, so it is not necessary to keep it visible just to show that the user received the message. It is also wrong to force them to keep it there as a sort of "Badge of Shame".

There are only four types of messages that a user should not remove: declined unblock requests while the block is still in effect, confirmed notices, miscellany for deletion tags (while the discussion is still in progress) and for unregistered editors. These templates are intended not only to communicate with the user in question but also to communicate with others.

Users should not remove only "portions" of another user's comment, nor edit their comment in any other way. This includes paraphrasing, or correcting spelling, grammar, or factual errors. Even though these actions may be well meaning, they can change the intent of the original user's comment. Indentation or re-sectioning of comments (to help identify who said what or to provide chronological context) is allowed. Removing wikilinks without removing the displayed text is also allowed, as users may not want their talk page to show up in the "what links here" special page for certain wikipedia pages.

Process

A process is a series of stages in time where the last stage is the product, result or goal. 

Processes may be "planned" or "unplanned".

A process planned by humans has a purpose. It is a course of action, or a procedure, to achieve a result, or an end-product. The sequence from start to finish is the plan. A plan may be written, or programmed, or just held in the mind. Examples: building a house, fighting a battle, sowing crops; organising a wedding...

A natural process has no conscious purpose, and may or may not have a definite end-product. Though it has no purpose or plan, it may follow a series of well-defined natural changes. It can be investigated and described. Examples: the evolution of the solar system; biological evolution; the growth of melting of ice at the Arctic; the process of development from egg to adult.

Processes often repeat whenever certain conditions hold. Example: car low on petrol/gas, visit garage and refill. Most computer programs are of this type. Processes may be circular: planets revolve around sun; eggs produce chickens, and chickens produce eggs.

Processes, especially those which are cyclical, may be subject to feedback. A simple case is a central heating system. Even an unplanned natural process may be controlled by feedback: evolution is a good example, in which the feedback is effected by relative fecundity.

Neiba

The Dominican city of Neiba, also written as Neyba, is the head municipality of the Baoruco province, on the southwestern part of the country.

Neiba, or Naiva, was the Taíno name of the "River Yaque del Sur".

Neiba is in the "Hoya de Enriquillo" or Neiba Valley, near the eastern end of the "Lake Enriquillo". The "Sierra de Neiba" mountain range is just to the north of the city, and covers the northern half of the municipality.

The southwestern part of the municipality, close to the lake Enriquillo, is below sea level.

The climate of the municipality is a tropical climate, very hot and dry in the valley, but it is cooler on the mountains of the Sierra de Neiba, where there are some rainforests.

Neiba is at 230 km to the west of Santo Domingo. The average temperature in the city is 27.9°C and the average rainfall is 655.5 mm but it rains in only 45.4 days.

Neiba has the municipality of Galván to the east, the Independencia province to the south, the municipality of Villa Jaragua to the west and the San Juan province to the north.

There are few small rivers, like Las Marías, Panzo, Don Juan and El Manguito.

Neiba has a total area of 275.33 km². It has only one municipal district (a subdivision of a municipality): El Palmar.

The municipality had, in 2002, a total population of 25,420: 12,987 men and 12,433 women. The urban population was 72.0% of the total population. In this numbers are not included the population of El Palmar municipal district.

The city of Neiba was founded in 1735; before that date, there were some people living here, raising cattle.

After the Dominican independence from Haiti, in 1844, Neiba became a municipality of the old Azua province. Several battles were fought near Neiba during the Dominican-Haitian War, including the first fight of that war: "La Fuente del Rodeo".

In 1881, with the creation of the old Barahona province, Neiba was made part of these new province.

When the Baoruco province was created in 1943, Neiba became the head municipality of the province.

Farming is the only economic activity in the municipality, except for some very small industries; some important products are grapes, plantain, sugar cane (mostly in the El Palmar municipal district) and coffee (on the Sierra de Neiba).

<doc id="203072" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=203072" title="Swan Lake">
Swan Lake

Swan Lake (, "Lebedínoye Ózero") is a ballet, op. 20, by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It was composed in 1875–1876. The story by Vladimir Begichev and Vasiliy Geltser was first split into four acts. It was made from Russian folk tales as well as an ancient German legend. It tells the story of Odette, a princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer's curse. The of the first performance was Julius Reisinger. The ballet was first shown on February 20, 1877, at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, and it was called"The Lake of the Swans".
Many critics have argued about what the "Swan Lake" story was based on. Fyodor Lopuokhov called "Swan Lake" a "national ballet" because the swans come from Russian sources, while many of the movements of the "corps de ballet" came from Slavonic ring-dances. According to Lopukhov, "both the plot of "Swan Lake" (despite the fact that it is based on German source), the image of the Swan and the very idea of a faithful love are essentially Russian". The libretto is based on a story by the German author Johann Karl August Musäus, "Der geraubte Schleier" (The Stolen Veil), but this story only has a short outline of the plot of "Swan Lake". The Russian folktale "The White Duck" also has links to the story of the ballet. People who knew Tchaikovsky said that he was very interested in the life story of Bavarian King Ludwig II, who Prince Siegfried was based on.
According to Tchaikovsky's nephew Yuri Lvovich Davydov and his niece Anna Meck-Davydov, he had already written a little ballet called "The Lake of the Swans" at their home in 1871. This ballet included the famous "leitmotif" known as the "Swan's Theme" (or "Song of the Swans" ). Vladimir Petrovich Begichev bought the score of "Swan Lake" from Tchaikovsky in 1875 for a rather modest fee of 800 rubles, and soon Begichev began to choose artists to dance in the ballet. Julius Reisinger designed the dances. Nobody knows whether Tchaikovsky and Reisinger worked closely together. It seems that at first Tchaikovsky worked without knowing exactly what Reisinger wanted. Tchaikovsky probably had some instructions about composing "Swan Lake", because he had to know what sort of dances would be needed. But while the instructions that Tchaikovsky received for the scores of "The Sleeping Beauty" and "The Nutcracker" have survived, the ones for "Swan Lake" didn't. When Reisinger began to plan the dances after the score was completed, he told Tchaikovsky to change some of the music. By doing this, Reisinger made it clear that he wanted a very large part in the making of this piece. Although the two artists needed to work together, they both liked to work alone as much as possible.
Tchaikovsky was very excited about creating Swan Lake. We know this because of the quick speed with which he composed. It was started the spring of 1875 and created within one full year. First, he wrote scores of the first three numbers of the ballet, then orchestrated it in the fall and winter, and was still trying to do the instrumentation in the spring. By April 1876, the work was fully completed. Tchaikovsky mentioned a draft, but it has never been found. He also wrote many letters to friends, saying how he had always wanted to work with this type of music, how excited he was about doing it.

Swan Lake is was written for a normal orchestra of the time:

<doc id="203079" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=203079" title="Adriaen Coorte">
Adriaen Coorte

Adriaen Coorte (about 1665 – 1707) was a Dutch painter. He mainly painted 'still life'. He signed works between 1683 and 1707. Most of his paintings are small. His style is typical of Dutch 17th century still life painting. Other Dutch painters who lived at the same time had a different style of painting. Coorte was "one of the last practitioners of this intimate category".

Very little is known about his life. Hw was probably born in Middelburg and also died there. He became a pupil of Melchior d'Hondecoeter around 1680 in Amsterdam. From 1683 he seems to have returned to Middelburg, where he set up a workshop and signed his small, carefully balanced minimalist still lifes. He often painted on paper that was glued to a wooden panel. About 80 signed works by him have been catalogued, and nearly all of them follow the same pattern; small arrangements of fruits, vegetables, or shells on a stone slab, lit from above, with the dark background typical of still lifes earlier in the century. Instead of the Chinese or silver vessels favoured by his contemporaries, his tableware is very basic pottery. "Objects and light are studied intensely, and are painted with a wondrous tenderness". Neither his birth nor death date is certain, and archival evidence only exists in Middelburg for his membership in the Guild of St. Luke there from 1695 onwards, when he was fined for selling a painting without being a member of the guild. His works appear frequently in contemporary Middelburg taxation inventories

Coorte was probably not well known to the people who lived at the same time, outside the city of Middelburg. Much like Vermeer, he was almost entirely forgotten. In the 1950s, the Dutch art historian Laurens J. Bol revived his reputation, beginning with an article in 1952, and finally publishing the first monograph and catalogue raissone on Coorte in 1977 ("Adriaen Coorte", Amsterdam). Bol arranged an exhibition of 35 examples of Coorte's work in 1958 at the Dordrechts Museum. This became a sensation in the Netherlands; the poets Hans Faverey and Ed Leeflang were both inspired by the paintings. In 2003 there was an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art, Washington. In 2008 a new travelling exhibition was set up; "Ode to Coorte", that was nearly as successful, making Coorte the most celebrated "rediscovered" Dutch Baroque painter of recent decades.

His paintings have been compared to Spanish Bodegones, but he may also have been influenced by older painters:

Still life

A still life is a work of art, most often a painting. In a still life, objects like flowers, fruit, or glasses are arranged in a certain way, and then painted. Still life painting has been popular since the 17th century, when Dutch painters like Adriaen Coorte raised it to a fine art. However, the idea is old: examples can be found in antiquity. With a still life, the artist can focus more on composition and arrangement than with other forms of painting, such as landscape painting or portraiture.

Portland Police Bureau (Oregon)

The Portland Police Bureau is the law enforcement agency of the City of Portland, the biggest city in the U.S. state of Oregon.
The Bureau, first named the Portland Metropolitan Police Force, was created in 1870 by the Portland City Council. The Council chose Phillip Saunders as its first chief of police, in charge of a force with six patrolmen and one lieutenant, at a time when the population of Portland was 9,000. The first member of the force to die in the line of duty was Officer Charles F. Schoppe, who was shot to death in 1874 while trying to disarm a drunken saloon customer. On April 1, 1908, the Bureau became the first in the United States to hire a female police officer, Lola Baldwin, who became the Superintendent of its newly created Women’s Protective Division. In 1915, the "Metropolitan Police Force" changes its name to the Bureau of Police. Four years later, the Bureau becomes the first in the USA to use police radio. In 1985, Penny Harrington becomes Portland’s first woman Chief of Police, and the first to head a major U.S. police department.

A partial skeleton was discovered in 2001. The fossils are about 1.8 million years old. The remains were first discovered in 1991 by Georgian scientist, David Lordkipanidze, accompanied by an international team which unearthed the remains. Implements and animal bones were found alongside the ancient human remains.

At first, scientists thought they had found mandibles and skulls belonging to "Homo ergaster", but size differences led them to name a new species.

At around 600 cm³ brain volume, the skull D2700 is dated to 1.77 million years old and in good condition offering insights in comparison to the modern human cranial morphology. The cranium was the smallest and most primitive Hominin skull ever discovered outside of Africa.

In Africa, the "Australopithecines" and early "Homo" represent two distinctive evolutionary paths sharing a common ancestor. In Georgia the specimens, with a brain half the size of anatomically modern humans, were the smallest found until the discovery of "Homo floresiensis" on the island of Flores in 2003.
There is a strong sexual dimorphism present, with males being significantly larger than females. This is a primitive trait, less obvious in more modern humans in Europe (ie. "Homo antecessor", "Homo heidelbergensis" and "Homo neanderthalensis").
The small size of this species contrasts with the much larger size of "Homo erectus". "H. georgicus" was the first species of "Homo" to settle in Europe, some 800,000 years before "H. erectus".

Later, four fossil skeletons were found, showing a species primitive in its skull and upper body but with relatively advanced spines and lower limbs, providing greater mobility. They are now thought to represent a stage soon after the transition between "Australopithecus" and "Homo erectus", and have been dated at 1.8 million years before the present, according to the leader of the project, David Lordkipanidze. The assemblage includes one of the largest Pleistocene Homo mandibles (D2600), one of the smallest Lower Pleistocene mandibles (D211), a nearly complete sub‐adult (D2735), and a completely edentulous specimen (D3900).

Chicxulub crater

The Chicxulub crater is a very big crater. Some scientists believe that the Chicxulub crater was made by the meteor that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, and many other animals. It is near the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. 

The Chicxulub crater is more than 180 km (110 mi) in diameter, making it the third largest confirmed impact crater. The bolide which formed the crater was at least 10 km (6 mi) in diameter.

Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas. The age of the rocks and isotope analysis show that this impact structure dates from the end of the Cretaceous period, roughly 65 million years ago. The impact associated with the crater is implicated in causing the extinction of the dinosaurs. Recent evidence suggests that the impactor may have been a piece of a much larger asteroid that broke up in a collision in distant space more than 160 million years ago.

In March 2010, following analysis of the available evidence covering 20 years' worth of data in the fields of palaeontology, geochemistry, climate modelling, geophysics and sedimentology, 41 international experts from 33 institutions reviewed available evidence and concluded that the impact at Chicxulub triggered the mass extinctions during K-T boundary including those of dinosaurs.

Ruslan Ponomariov

Ruslan Ponomariov (Cyrillic: Русла́н Пономарёв), born 11 October 1983, is a Ukrainian chess player and former FIDE world champion.

In 2002 he beat his fellow countryman Vassily Ivanchuk in the final of the FIDE World Championship 2002 by a score of 4½–2½. This made him FIDE world champion at the age of 18, the first teenager and youngest person to win this form of the title. However, he is not the youngest undisputed world champion because the traditional World Chess Championship was still held by Vladimir Kramnik. 

In the same year he finished second in the very strong Linares tournament, behind Garry Kasparov. His result in the strong 2003 Corus tournament at Wijk aan Zee was not as good – despite having the third highest rating, he finished only joint eleventh out of fourteen players with 6/13, and at Linares the same year he finished only fifth out of seven with 5½/12.

There were plans for him to play a fourteen-game match against Kasparov in Yalta in September 2003, the winner of which would go on to play the winner of a match between Kramnik and Péter Lékó as part of the so-called "Prague Agreement" to reunify the World Chess Championship (from 1993 until 2006 there were two world chess championships). However, this was called off after Ponomariov refused to sign his contract without reservation. 

Ponomariov remained FIDE champion until Rustam Kasimdzhanov won the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004.

Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis is the weakening of bones in the body. It is caused by lack of calcium deposited in the bones. This lack of calcium causes the bones to become brittle, so they break easily. Some side effects are limping. Some symptoms late in the disease include pain in the bones, living in a wheel chair (as a result of), and lower back pain due to spinal bone fractures.

Elderly people are more likely to develop osteoporosis than younger people. The amount of calcium in the bones decreases as a person gets older.
