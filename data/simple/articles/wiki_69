Carl Woese

Carl Richard Woese (Syracuse, New York, July 15, 1928) is an American microbiologist and physicist.

Woese is famous for defining the Archaea (a new domain or kingdom of life) in 1977. He used phylogenetic taxonomy of 16S ribosomal RNA, a technique pioneered by him which is now standard practice. 

He was also the originator of the RNA world hypothesis in 1977, although not by that name. He holds the Stanley O. Ikenberry Chair and is professor of microbiology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

After defining Archaea as a new domain, Woese redrew the taxonomic tree. His three-domain system is based upon genetic relationships. It divides life into 23 main divisions in three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Archaea are neither bacteria nor eukaryotes. Looked at another way, they are prokaryotes that are not bacteria.

The tree of life shows the diversity of microbes. Single-celled organisms represent the vast majority of the biosphere's diversity. This is surprising to some, given our familiarity with the larger metazoan world. Microbes are responsible for many biochemical cycles and are crucial to the whole biosphere. Woese's efforts to clarify the evolution and diversity of microbes was an invaluable service to ecology, conservation and evolutionary biology.

Bodleian Library

The Bodleian Library (founded in 1602) is the main library of the University of Oxford, and one of the oldest libraries in Europe. It is the second largest library in the United Kingdom after the British Library. It is one of six legal deposit libraries for works published in the United Kingdom and under Irish Law it is entitled to request a copy of each book published in the Republic of Ireland. It has had rights of legal deposit for books since the 17th century. 

Though members of the University may borrow some books from some dependent libraries (such as the Radcliffe Science Library), the vast majority of the material held by the Bodleian may only be read within the library buildings. Besides books, periodicals and manuscripts there are smaller collections of other types of material.

The Library occupies a group of five buildings near Broad Street in central Oxford: the oldest is the late medieval Duke Humfrey's Library and the newest the New Bodleian of the 1930s. Since the 19th century a number of underground stores have been built below parts of these.

Though Duke Humfrey's Library was a library for the university from 1488 to 1560 the Bodleian itself was founded by Sir Thomas Bodley in the years 1598 to 1602. In the following centuries it greatly increased in size through collections of books donated by generous benefactors and through books received through legal deposit.

Many notable scholars have been heads of the library (known as Bodley's Librarians): the present Bodley's Librarian is Sarah Thomas.

Camborne is a town in west Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is at the western edge of a conurbation consisting of Camborne, Pool and Redruth.

The population of Camborne was 20,010 at the 2001 census. The population of the whole conurbation was 39,937, making it the largest conurbation in Cornwall.

It is no longer an industrial town but the Camborne and Redruth district was formerly one of the richest tin mining areas in the world. The Camborne School of Mines was founded here in the 19th century to train engineers to work in the tin mines and is still in the town. Two of the famous mines of Camborne were Dolcoath, the 'Queen of Cornish Mines' (closed 1921), once the deepest mine in the world, and South Crofty, the last working tin mine in Europe, which closed in 1998.

On Christmas Eve 1801, the Puffing Devil, a steam-powered road vehicle built by Camborne engineer Richard Trevithick, moved up Camborne Hill. It was the world's first self-propelled passenger carrying vehicle. The events have been turned into a local song:

<doc id="298185" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298185" title="Michael Todd">
Michael Todd

Michael Todd (June 22, 1909 – March 22, 1958), byname Mike Todd, was an American theatre and film producer. He is known for making movies, starting the film formats of Cinerama and Todd-AO, and his 1957 marriage to actress Elizabeth Taylor (1930-2011). Todd's 1956 production of "Around the World in Eighty Days" won an Academy Award for Best Picture. Todd is also well-known as the third of Elizabeth Taylor's seven husbands.

Todd was born Avrom Hirsch Goldbogen in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Chaim Goldbogen (an Orthodox rabbi) and Sophia Hellerman, both Polish Jewish immigrants. He was one of nine children in a poor family, the youngest son, and his siblings nicknamed him "Toat" to mimic his difficulty saying the word "coat". It was from this nickname that his name "Todd" was derived (said in Germanic/Yiddish as "Tote").

The family later moved to Chicago, arriving on the day World War I ended. Todd was expelled in the sixth grade for running a game of craps inside the school. In high school, he produced the school play, "The Mikado", which was considered a hit. He eventually dropped out of high school and worked at a variety of jobs, including shoe salesman and store window decorator. One of his first jobs was as a soda jerk at a drugstore. When that drugstore went out of business, Todd had learned enough medical knowledge from his work there to be hired at Chicago's Michael Reese Hospital, as a type of "security guard" to stop visitors from bringing in food that was not on each patient's diet.

At age 17, Todd married Bertha Freshman in Crown Point, Indiana, on Valentine's Day 1927. He had been serious about Bertha since age 14, but needed to develop confidence before even asking her out. In 1929, she bore him a son, Michael Todd, Jr. A turning point came for Todd when his father died in 1931; Avrom Goldbogen made the decision to change his name to "Michael Todd" on the same day. Bertha Todd died of a pneumothorax (collapsed lung) in 1946 in Santa Monica, California, while undergoing surgery at St. John's Hospital, for a damaged tendon in her finger. Todd and his wife were separated at the time of her death; less than a week before, he had filed for divorce. The following year, Todd married actress Joan Blondell on July 5, 1947. They were divorced on June 8, 1950, after she alleged that he had abused and extorted her. Todd's third marriage was to the actress Elizabeth Taylor, with whom he had a tempestuous relationship. The couple exchanged vows on February 2, 1957. Todd was 47 and Taylor was 24; he was her third husband. Todd and Taylor had a daughter, Elizabeth Frances (Liza) Todd, who was born on August 7, 1957.

On 22 March 1958, Todd's private plane "Lucky Liz" crashed near Grants, New Mexico. The plane, a twin-engine Lockheed Lodestar, suffered an engine failure while being flown overloaded in icing conditions. The plane was flying at an altitude which was too high to sustain flight with only one working engine under those conditions. The plane went out of control and crashed, killing all 4 people on board. In addition to Todd, those who died in the crash were screenwriter and author Art Cohn, who was writing Todd's biography "The Nine Lives of Mike Todd"; pilot Bill Verner; and co-pilot Tom Barclay. Taylor wanted to fly to New York with her husband, but stayed home with a cold after her pleas to come along were overruled by Todd. Just hours before the crash, Todd described the plane as safe as he phoned friends, including Joseph Mankiewicz and Kirk Douglas, in an attempt to recruit a gin rummy player for the flight: "Ah, c'mon," he said. "It's a good, safe plane. I wouldn't let it crash. I'm taking along a picture of Elizabeth, and I wouldn't let anything happen to her."

His son, Mike Jr., wanted his father's body to be cremated after it was identified through dental records and brought to Albuquerque, New Mexico, but Taylor refused, saying he would not want cremation. Todd was buried in Forest Park, Illinois, at Beth Aaron Cemetery in plot 66, which is part of Jewish Waldheim there. In his autobiography, Eddie Fisher, who considered himself to be Todd's best friend, stated:
The remains were desecrated by robbers, who broke into Todd's coffin looking for a $100,000 diamond ring, which, according to rumor, Taylor had placed on her husband's finger prior to his burial. The bag containing Todd's remains was found under a tree near his burial plot; the bag and coffin had been sealed in Albuquerque after Todd's remains were identified following the 1958 crash. Todd's remains were once more identified through dental records and were reburied in a secret location.

Todd began his career in the construction business, where he made a fortune but later lost it. He opened the so-called College of Bricklaying of America, buying the materials to teach bricklaying on credit. The school was forced to shut its doors when the Bricklayers' Union did not view the college as an accepted place of study. Todd and his brother, Frank, next opened their own construction company. Their company was worth over a million dollars but came to an abrupt halt when its financial backing failed in the wake of the Great Depression. Not yet twenty-one, Todd had lost over a million dollars with the loss of his backer. He was now the father of an infant son and had no home for his family. 

He later served as a contractor to Hollywood studios, and during the 1933-1934 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago, he produced an attraction called the "Flame Dance." In this number, gas jets were designed to burn part of a dancer's costume off, leaving her naked in appearance. The act attracted enough attention to bring an offer from the Casino de Paris club in New York City. Todd got his first taste of Broadway life with that engagement and was determined to find a way to work there. He came up with the idea of producing the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta "The Mikado" with an all-African-American cast. "The Hot Mikado", starring Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, opened on Broadway March 23, 1939. His Broadway success gave him the nerve to try taking on showman Billy Rose. Todd visited Grover Whalen, president of the 1939 New York World's Fair, with a proposal to bring the Broadway show to the World's Fair. Whelan, eager to have the show at the fair, covered Todd's Broadway early closing costs. Rose, who had an exclusivity clause in his fair contract, met Todd at Lindy's, where Rose learned his contract covered new forms of entertainment only. Todd's "Mikado" dated back to 1885. To avoid any head-to head competition, Rose quickly agreed to promote Todd's production along with his own. Todd went on to produce 30 Broadway shows during his career.

Todd's business career was volatile, and failed ventures left him bankrupt many times.

In 1945, Todd suggested the idea of holding the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in newly-liberated Berlin (Germany). Although baseball's new commissioner Happy Chandler was reportedly "intrigued" by the idea, it was ultimately dismissed as impractical. The game was finally cancelled due to wartime travel restrictions.

In 1952, Todd made a production of the Johann Strauss II operetta, "A Night In Venice", complete with floating gondolas at the then-newly constructed Jones Beach Theatre in Long Island, New York. It ran for two seasons.

In 1950, Mike Todd formed The Cinerama Company with the broadcaster Lowell Thomas (who founded Capital Cities Communications) and the inventor Fred Waller. The company was created to exploit Cinerama, a film process created by Waller that used three film projectors to create a giant composite image on a curved screen. The first Cinerama feature, "This is Cinerama", was released in September 1952. 

Before its release, Todd left the Cinerama Company to develop a widescreen process which would eliminate some of Cinerama's flaws. The result was the Todd-AO process, designed by the American Optical Company. The process was first used commercially for the successful 1955 film adaptation of "Oklahoma!" (starring Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones). Todd later produced the film for which he is best remembered, "Michael Todd's Around the World in 80 Days", which debuted in cinemas on October 17, 1956. Costing $6 million to produce, the movie earned $16 million at the box office. In 1957, "Around the World in 80 Days" won the Best Picture Academy Award.

A William Woolfolk novel from the early 1960s, entitled "My Name Is Morgan", was considered to be loosely based on Todd's life and career.

The cloaca is a common rear opening in land vertebrates. Through this opening, the animals expel urine and faeces, and carry out reproduction.

The cloaca is a primitive or 'basal' feature of tetrapods. All amphibia, all sauropsids (reptiles and birds) and even monotreme mammals possess a cloaca.

A different method is used by therian mammals, such as marsupials and placentals. They have an anus for defecation, and another opening for urine and sexual reproduction.

Whitehurst &amp; Son sundial (1812)

The Whitehurst & Son Sundial was produced in Derby in 1812 by the nephew of John Whitehurst. It is now in the Derby Museum and Art Gallery. This is a precise sundial which tells not only local apparent time but also local mean time using a scale on it. It is accurate to the nearest minute.

The Whitehurst family was known in Derby as skillful mechanics. John Whitehurst (1713–1788) was born in Congleton, but came to Derby where he became a watch and clock maker. He moved to London to assume the post of Inspector of Weights. His nephew continued the business under the name of Whitehurst & Son. The family business was known for their turret clocks.

To construct a sundial, one must understand the geometry of the solar system, and particularly how the sun will cast a shadow onto a flat surface, in this case a horizontal surface. Each day over a yearly cycle the shadow will be different from the day before, and the shadow is specific to the location of the dial, particularly its latitude. The dial is designed to tell local apparent time so the longitude is not important. In this case, noon will be at the point when the sun is highest in sky and due south, and standard time would be when the sun was due south at another point such as the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. Derby is at 1° 28′ 46.2″ West of Greenwich , so the sun is approximately 5 mins and 52.05 s later in reaching noon. And also when telling the time, we must consider the equation of time. That is to say, as the earth moves around the sun in a slight ellipse, day length slightly varies everyday. For example, the difference from the average becomes up to 16 minutes in November and February. This equation of time had been really unknown for a long time until people started comparing sundials with mechanical clocks. If a clock ignores this difference, it measures average time. If a clock is re balanced each day to make them correspond with the natural cycle, it measures local mean time. A fixed noon and fixed day are essential for railways timetabling, so Greenwich Mean Time was adopted. In the case of Midland Railway, it was by January 1848.

This particular bronze sundial is marked "Whitehurst and Son/Derby/1812" and is thought to have been made for George Benson Strutt (who was the younger brother of the cotton spinner William Strutt), for his home Bridge Hill House, in Belper. This has the precise location of 53° 1′ 49.08″ north, and 1° 29′ 26.88″ West of Greenwich, which is slightly different from those of Derby, at 52° 55′ 00″ north, , a difference of 6′ 49″. The Longitude is almost same, and gives only a 2 second time difference.

The dial is stoutly made and has one thick style (gnomon, a stick which casts shadow on the plate). The dial plate is not one complete circle but two semicircles separated by the thickness of the style. In this design of sundial, the angle of the style to the dial plate is exactly the same as latitude, which is 53° 1′ 49″ (the latitude of the Bridge Hill House). 
The dial plate will be perfectly horizontal there. In case it is placed at different location, slight adjustment for latitude is required by slanting the dial plate. As the dial is now 0° 6′ 49″, or about 1/10th of a degree south- the nose of the gnomon needs to be raised by that amount.

In the "horizontal sundial" (also called a "garden sundial"), the plane that receives the shadow is aligned horizontally. (In the equatorial dial, the style stands vertically against the plate.) Hence, the line of shadow does not rotate uniformly on the dial face. Consequently, the hour lines are spaced according to a calculation. 
The dial plate is strictly engraved with hour lines which were calculated using the formula:

where λ is the sundial's geographical latitude (and the angle the style makes with horizontal), θ is the angle between a given hour-line and the noon hour-line (which always points towards true North) on the plane, and "t" is the number of hours before or after noon.

For each of the hours 1 to 6, the formula is calculated. For instance at 3 hours after noon, we substitute the numbers 53.03 and 3 into the formula

This generates these results
The hours before noon are exactly the same, because the dial is symmetrical, so the other lines are mirror images of those above.
In the same manner, the half hours and the minute lines would be calculated. As noon is set exactly on the north-south line, and not 5' and 54" (time difference between Belper and Greenwich) to one side, we can tell that this dial is telling Belper time and not Greenwich time.

Significantly, on the plate we can see a pair of scales that help the observer make the equation of time correction. One scale gives the date in months and days.

The 15th April is one day when no conversion needs to be made. This dial can be used both to read solar time shown by sundials and also the mean time that is favoured by clocks , with the practical purpose that observers can use the dial to calibrate their pocket watches, which in 1812 would not always run true. By 1820 watches manufacture had improved and the Lever escapement had become popular, so frequent calibration was no longer needed.

Chimney

A chimney is a structure used to ventilate hot flue gases or smoke from a boiler, stove, furnace or fireplace to the outside atmosphere. Most chimneys are vertical, or almost vertical, to make sure that the gases flow easily, drawing air into the combustion in what is known as the stack, or chimney, effect. The space inside a chimney is called a "flue". Chimneys may be found in buildings, steam locomotives and ships. In the United States, the term smokestack is also used when talking about locomotive chimneys or ship chimneys, the word funnel can be used too.

The Height of a chimney is really important, when higher, chimney's dispersion of pollutants will not cause too much influence on surrounding areas. Tall chimneys also allow chemicals to self-neutralize in the air before they reach the ground.

Stephen Jay Gould

Stephen Jay Gould (September 10, 1941 – May 20, 2002) was an American paleontologist, evolutionary biologist, taxonomist, and historian of science. 

He was also one of the most influential and widely read writers of popular science of his generation.

Gould spent most of his career teaching at Harvard University and working at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. In the latter years of his life, Gould also taught biology and evolution at New York University near his home in SoHo.

Gould's greatest contribution to science was the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which he developed with Niles Eldredge in 1972. The theory proposes that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary stability, which is punctuated by rare instances of branching evolution. The theory was contrasted against the idea that evolutionary change is marked by a pattern of smooth and continuous change in the fossil record.

Most of Gould's empirical research was based on the snail genera "Poecilozonites" and "Cerion". He also contributed to evolutionary developmental biology, and has received wide praise for his book "Ontogeny and Phylogeny". In evolutionary theory he opposed strict selectionism, sociobiology as applied to humans, and evolutionary psychology. He campaigned against creationism.

Many of Gould's "Natural History" essays were reprinted in collected volumes.

Psocoptera are an order of insects that are commonly known as booklice, barklice or barkflies. They first appeared in the Permian period, 295–248 million years ago. They are often regarded as the most primitive of the hemipterans. Their name originates from the Greek word "psokos" meaning gnawed or rubbed and "ptera" meaning wings. There are more than 5,500 species in 41 families in three suborders. Many of these species have only been described in recent years.

They range in size from 1–10 millimeters (0.04–0.4 in) in length.

Judith Rich Harris

Judith Rich Harris (born February 10, 1938) researches psychology. She is an independent researcher. This means that she is not a university professor. Her most famous book is "The Nurture Assumption". The book asks "Why [do] Children Turn Out the Way They Do"? Its answer is that "Parents Matter Less Than You Think and Peers Matter More". 

Harris graduated from Tucson High School and attended the University of Arizona and Brandeis University, from where she graduated magna cum laude in 1959. In 1961 she received a master's degree in psychology from Harvard University.

She married Charles S. Harris in 1961; they have two daughters (one adopted) and four grandchildren.

Harris suffers from an autoimmune disease.

Harris's most famous work is "The Nurture Assumption". It was published in 1998. A revised version was published in 2009. Children often act like their parents act. Some psychologists thought this was because of the way that parents raised their children. Harris argues that (some or all of) this similarity is due to genetics. Otherwise, parents are not the most important factor in child development. This book argues that peers are more important. Harris argues that children are socialized by peers. 

Harris also wrote "No Two Alike: Human Nature and Human Individuality". It was published in February 2006. Harris attempts to explain why people are so different in personality, even identical twins who grow up in the same home.

St Columb Major is a small town in Cornwall, United Kingdom. Often referred to locally as "St Columb", it is about seven miles (11 km) southwest of Wadebridge and six miles (10 km) east of Newquay.

Twice a year the town plays host to the game of "hurling", a medieval game once common in Cornwall but now only played in St Columb and two other towns. It is played on Shrove Tuesday and then again on the Saturday eleven days later. The game involves two teams of several hundred people (the 'townsmen' and the 'countrymen') who attempt to carry a silver ball made of apple wood to goals set two miles (3 km) apart, making the parish the largest pitch for a ball game anywhere in the world.

River Tamar

The River Tamar is a river in South West England, that forms most of the border between Devon (to the east) and Cornwall (to the west). The Tamar's source is less than 6 km (4 miles) from the north Cornish coast, but it flows southward. At its mouth, the Tamar flows into the Hamoaze (a wide estuary) before entering Plymouth Sound. Tributaries of the river include the rivers Inny, Ottery, Kensey and Lynher (or "St Germans River") on the Cornish side, and the Deer and Tavy on the Devon side.

King Athelstan of England made the east bank of the River Tamar the boundary between England and Cornwall in the year 936. There are no road bridges over the lower Tamar apart from the modern Tamar Bridge at Saltash which was built to replace the ferry. In 1859 the Royal Albert Bridge was built across the Tamar at Saltash to carry the main railway line into Cornwall.

The Tamar Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty covers around 195 km² (75 square miles) around the lower Tamar (below Launceston) and its tributaries the Tavy and the Lynher. It was first proposed in 1963, but was not designated until 1995.

Corinthian order

The corinthian order is one of the three main classical orders ("styles") of ancient Greek and Roman architecture. The other two are the Doric order and Ionic order. 

The Corinthian is the most decorative of the three orders. It has thin columns that have grooves running vertically up the sides. The most important difference with the other orders is the big capital ("top part of the column"), which is decorated with leaves and scrolls.

The oldest known example of a Corinthian column is in the Temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae in Arcadia, "ca" 450–420 BC. This column stands inside the temple and does not form part of the wall. The oldest use of the Corinthian order on the outside of a structure is the round Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in Athens. It was put in place around 334 BC.

The Wellington Monument is an obelisk in the Phoenix Park, Dublin, Ireland. It is also called "Wellington Testimonial" because it was built while Wellington was still alive.

The monument is in the southeast of the Park. It is near Kilmainham and the River Liffey. The obelisk is tall. It is the largest obelisk in Europe.

The monument was built to celebrate the victories of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. He was born in Dublin.

It was designed by the architect Sir Robert Smirke. Building was started in 1817. In 1820 they ran out of money. It was not finished until 1861 when it was opened to the public. There were also plans for a statue of Wellesley on a horse in front of it. This was never built.

There are four bronze plaques on the bottom part of the monument. Three have pictures about Wellington's career, the fourth has text. The pictures are 'Civil and Religious Liberty' by John Hogan, 'Waterloo' by Thomas Farrell and the 'Indian Wars' by Joseph Robinson Kirk. The text reads:

Ashtown Castle is a towerhouse in the Phoenix Park in Dublin. It is now part of the Phoenix Park Visitor Centre.

It is not clear when the castle was first built. It might date back as far as 1430. The roof dates from the 17th century. 

After the building was made bigger and improved, it was used as the house for the Under Secretary of Ireland from 1782. In 1922, it became the house for the first United States ambassador to Ireland. After the ambassador moved to the Chief Secretary's Lodge, the Papal nuncio used the building until 1978 when he moved. 

In 1978, the building was in bad shape. It could not be repaired. When they started to break down the building, they found the towerhouse inside the bigger building. It was restored to its old form.

Topoisomerase

Topoisomerase is an enzyme that unwind and wind DNA in order to help the creation of DNA structures. 

DNA is in a helix/spiral which helps make the structure of DNA strong and stable. However, when undergoing DNA replication, the spiral needs to be untwisted, and when spirals are being untwisted knots, and breaks can happen. When studying the structure of DNA, James D. Watson and Francis Crick knew that there was need for an enzyme to overcome this problem. 

Topoisomerase binds to either side of the DNA strands and allows the DNA to be untangled or unwound.

Perranzabuloe

Perranzabuloe is a coastal civil parish and a hamlet in Cornwall, United Kingdom. The hamlet (containing the parish church) is just over a mile (2 km) south of the main settlement of the parish, Perranporth and seven miles (11 km) south-southwest of Newquay. The parish population was 5,382 in the 2001 census.

The name of the parish comes from the medieval Latin "Perranus in Sabulo" meaning Piran in the sand. Piran (the patron saint of Cornwall) was a Christian evangelist who founded a church in the seventh century near the coast north of Perranporth. The ruins of this church were rediscovered in the 20th century. The medieval parish church of Perranzabuloe was over a long period completely lost in sand dunes. A new church had to be built further away from the coast.

Christmas Raid

The Christmas Raid or "Magazine fort raid" happened on the 23 December 1939. The Irish Republican Army (IRA) stole a lot of weapons and ammunitions ("bullets") from the Irish Army. Although the theft from the Magazine Fort building in Phoenix Park was succesful, most of what was stolen was recovered by the Irish Army a few days later. Several IRA volunteers were arrested.

The reason for the raid was that the IRA had many Thompson submachine guns. They found it hard to get the .45 ACP bullets used in these guns in Europe. Because the Irish Army also used the Thompson and had large supplies of bullets, the IRA decided to steal some. 

Around 2030 the gate bell rang, and the Military Police officer on guard opened the gate a little for a civilian who said he had a parcel to deliver to the officer-in-charge. The unidentified man told the MP to open the gate fully and put his hands up. At this point the IRA team appeared from both inside and outside the fort, confiscating the weapons of the sentry and MP.

The two hostages were then forced to act as human shields for the two intruders to the guardroom where the remaining soldiers were caught by surprise and gave up without a fight. The captives heard 'many' heavy lorries coming and going from the depot. At 2210 hrs the IRA locked the prisoners in the so called 'C' Magazine area which the raiders had completely emptied. 

It was 2250 by the time a party of soldiers was sent from Portobello Barracks to find out what was happening at the fort. They managed to catch two of the raiders. 

A total of 1,084,000 rounds of ammunition had been taken and removed in thirteen lorries with no casualties.

Over the next three to four days a large, nationwide hunt was organised to find the stolen items.

On 1 January 1940 it was reported that almost three-quarters of the ammunition had been found, a total of 850,000 rounds; 

In addition, some IRA volunteers who were caught storing the ammunition were arrested.

The raid was not good for the IRA. The massive hunt to find what was stolen turned up all and more. It caused IRA Volunteers to be arrested. 

The day after the raid the Irish Minister for Justice, Gerald Boland, at an emergency meeting of the Dáil ("government") introduced the Emergency Powers bill to allow internment ("taking prisoner"), Military Tribunal, and executions for IRA members. It became the Emergency Powers Act.

<doc id="298433" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298433" title="Vestigial organ">
Vestigial organ

Vestigial organs are organs of the body which are smaller and simpler than those in related species. They have lost, or almost lost their original function.

Vestigiality is evidence for evolution, since they only make sense if evolution has occurred. They were one of the puzzles of pre-Darwinian natural history. The puzzle vanished once biologists realised they once were working adaptations, in the ancestors of present-day animals.

They occur in animals (and plants) which have changed their style of life from their ancestors. Thus snakes lost their legs as their system of movement changed. But one type of snake – the boas – have vestigial rear legs and pelvis. The human vermiform appendix is another example. That was much larger, and stored microbes which produced cellulase to break down plant cell walls. Leaves are the main diet of apes.

An unused organ usually degenerates, and becomes smaller or vanishes altogether. Thus amphibia living in dark caves lose their sight and their body colour. Mutations pile up. All structures need energy for their development, maintenance, and weight. This, and the risk of disease in the part (e.g., infection, cancer), provide some selection for the removal of parts which no longer help an organism's fitness. 

The human appendix had selection against it because of deaths from appendicitis. Appendicitis was untreatable until modern times. The selection pressure was probably weak, because most cases occur after the age of peak fertility.

Observations on the cave-dwelling amphipod "Gammarus minus" showed active selection against their vestigial eyes. When mating, the males remain on their females for a week or so after fertilisation, guarding them against other males. The eye sizes of paired males were compared with those of unpaired males. The eye sizes of paired males were smaller than the unpaired ones. Obviously, on average, the paired males would have higher fertility than the unpaired males. The selection gradient was estimated as –0.30, which means the selection for small eyes was quite strong. The researchers supposed that the loss of sight freed more of the nervous system to process other sensory inputs.

Occasionally, selection turns vestigial organs to a new function. Thus the mammalian ear ossicles were once bones in the jaw of early proto-mammals, the Therapsida. The halteres of flies is a perfect example. The word exaption was coined for this phenomenon.

Boscastle is a village and fishing port on the north coast of Cornwall, United Kingdom, and 14 miles (23 km) south of Bude and 5 miles (8 km) north-east of Tintagel. 

The name of the village derives from Bottreaux Castle, a 12th century fortress, of which little survives. There is no church in Boscastle but there are churches at Forrabury and Minster. Boscastle harbour is a natural inlet protected by two stone harbour walls built in 1584 by Sir Richard Grenville. The oldest part of Boscastle surrounds the harbour; more modern residential building extends up the valleys of the Rivers Valency and Jordan.

A flash flood on 16 August 2004, caused extensive damage to the village. Residents were trapped in houses and elsewhere as the roads turned into rivers. In the largest peacetime rescue operation ever launched in the UK a total of 91 people were rescued and there were no deaths.

Tintagel, formerly Trevena, is a civil parish and village on the Atlantic coast of Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is about 5 miles from Boscastle and 6 miles from Camelford. The population of the parish is 1,820 people. The village and nearby Tintagel Castle are associated with the legends surrounding King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table. The village has, in recent times, become attractive to tourists from many parts of the world and is one of the most-visited places in Britain. The modern-day village of Tintagel was known as Trevena until the Post Office decided to call it 'Tintagel' in the mid 19th century (until then Tintagel had always been the name of the headland and of the parish).

In the village is the 'Old Post Office', which dates from the 14th century. It became a post office during the 19th century, and is now owned by the National Trust. There are three churches in Tintagel, the Anglican church of St Materiana on the cliffs, and Methodist and Roman Catholic churches in the village.

Scholars have found it hard to explain the origin of 'Tintagel' as a name: the most likely one to be correct is from Norman French, rather than from Cornish.

British Council

The British Council is an organization in the United Kingdom which specializes in international educational and cultural opportunities. Its main activities are 'Learning/Teaching, the Arts, Science and Society'. Its headquarters is in Spring Gardens near Whitehall in Central London. There are other branch offices in Belfast, Cardiff, Manchester and Edinburgh. Its overseas network covers 233 locations in over 100 countries. The British Council is registered as a charity, both in England and Wales, and in Scotland. It receives grants from the British government. The rest is earned from teaching English to individuals and organizations, conducting examinations, and providing consultancy. 

The British Council was founded in 1934 as the "British Committee for Relations with Other Countries". The idea came from Sir Reginald ("Rex") Leeper who recognizes the importance of "cultural propaganda" in promoting British interests. He was encouraged by the success of the official cultural organizations of France, Germany and Italy. The British Council's 'sponsoring department' is the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the British government, although it runs its day-to-day activities independently. In September 2009, its Director of Arts, Rebecca Walton, said: "We want people to become more inclined towards the UK and more sensitive to the positive benefits of the UK in the world".

Routledge

Routledge is a British publisher. It has changed names and owners many times since it was first formed by George Routledge (1812–1888) in 1836. The firm continued to grow until 1902 when it almost became bankrupt. However, it managed to recover after refinancing and began to buy up and merge with other publishing companies. From 1912 onwards, it increasingly focuses on academic publishing. It soon became well-known for its books in humanities and social sciences. Taylor & Francis bought Routledge in 1998.

One-Unit was the title of a scheme launched by the federal government of Pakistan to merge the four provinces of West Pakistan into one homogenous unit, as a counterbalance against the numerical domination of the ethnic Bengalis of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). The One Unit policy was announced by Prime Minister Muhammad Ali Bogra on 22 November 1954.

The province of West Pakistan was created in 14 October 1955 by the merger of the provinces, states and Tribal Areas of the western wing. The province was composed of twelve divisions and the provincial capital was established at Lahore. The province of East Pakistan, consisted of East Bengal, (now Bangladesh) was renamed East Pakistan with the provincial capital at Dacca. The federal government moved the country's capital in 1959 from Karachi to Rawalpindi (serving as provisional capital until Islamabad was finished), whilst the federal legislature moved to Dacca.

West Pakistan formed a single and united political entity but with marked linguistic and ethnic distinctions. The One Unit policy was regarded as an administrative reform that would reduce expenditure and help eliminate ethnic and parochial prejudices. However, with the military coup of 1958, trouble loomed for the province when the office of Chief Minister was abolished and the President took over executive powers for West Pakistan. The province of West Pakistan was dissolved on July 1, 1970 by President General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan.

Ethno-nationalists were against the unity and amalgamation of the federating units(the many princely states and provinces of the western wing) as West Pakistan. The actual author of the plan is alleged to be General and later President Ayub Khan.

Bodmin Moor

Bodmin Moor is a granite moorland in northeastern Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is in size, and originally dates from the Carboniferous period of geological history. 

Bodmin Moor is one of five granite plutons (underground masses of igneous rock) in Cornwall. 

The name 'Bodmin Moor' is fairly recent, invented in 1813. It was formerly known as Fowey Moor after the River Fowey which rises within it. Since the mid 18th century Bodmin Moor has been crossed by the trunk road now known as the A30.

Dramatic granite tors rise from the rolling moorland: the best known are Brown Willy, the highest point in Cornwall at , and Rough Tor at . Considerable areas of the moor are poorly drained and form marshes (in hot summers these can dry out). The rest of the moor is mostly rough pasture or overgrown with heather and other low vegetation.

The Moor contains about 500 farm holdings with around 10,000 beef cows, 55,000 breeding ewes and 1,000 horses and ponies. Most of the moor is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and has been officially designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), as part of Cornwall AONB.

Bodmin Moor is the source of several of Cornwall's rivers: they are mentioned here anti-clockwise from the south. 


Inland waters on the moor include Dozmary Pool (Cornwall's only natural inland lake) and
three reservoirs, Colliford Lake, Siblyback Lake and Crowdy reservoir which supply water for a large part of the county's population.

Amphipod

The Amphipods are an order of malacostracan crustaceans. They have no carapace. 

The name "amphipoda" means "different-footed". Unlike isopods, where all the legs are alike, amphipods have different appendage types. 

Of the 7,000 species, 5,500 are classified into one suborder, the Gammaridea. The rest are in two or three other suborders. 

Amphipods range in size from and are mostly detritivores or scavengers. They live in almost all aquatic environments; 750 species live in caves and the order also includes terrestrial animals and sandhoppers such as "Talitrus saltator".

Mature females bear a "marsupium", or brood pouch, which holds her eggs while they are fertilised, and until the young are ready to hatch. As a female ages, she produces more eggs in each brood. Mortality is around 25%–50% for the eggs. There are no larval stages; the eggs hatch directly into a juvenile form, and sexual maturity is generally reached after 6 moults.

Converter

A converter is a chemical reactor which turns raw iron into steel. 

Raw iron called "pig iron" which is the product of blast furnace, contains up to 4% of carbon. It is too hard and brittle for meaningful use. The carbon must first be burned off the iron to produce steel. This process is called "conversion" and the reactor "converter".

The first converter was invented by Sir Henry Bessemer in 1856. He built a pear-shaped large vessel with nozzles (tuyeres) for air in the bottom. Hot molten pig iron from blast furnace was poured in the converter, and then air was pumped in at the bottom with high pressure. The result was a loud noise and a flame of up to 20 metres off the mouth of the converter. After ten minutes all the pig iron had become steel. The Bessemer converter was the first successful reactor on converting pig iron into steel, and the era of steel began. Steel was now plentiful and cheap.

However, steel becomes better if only oxygen is blown in. Air contains nitrogen, which is harmful for some steel grades. A modern converter called basic oxygen furnace uses pure oxygen instead of air. It was invented 1949 in Austria.

The modern basic oxygen converter is a large pumpkin-shape vessel which is made from steel and lined with refractories such as calcium oxide and magnesium oxide line so the vessel can withstand the high temperature of molten metal. 

Molten pig iron and scrap are loaded in the converter. The scrap usually is rusty and contains oxygen, so some of the rust reacts with the pig iron, burning the carbon away and creating heat which melts the scrap. Once all scrap has melted, a special pipe called "oxygen lance" is lowered in the pig iron, and a very fast and sharp blow of oxygen is blasted in. The oxygen burns all the carbon away and mixes the liquid steel thoroughly. Once all carbon has been burned away, some extra carbon is inserted to raise the contents to desired level. The result is liquid steel, which is then tapped away and taken to rolling mill to produce steel products.

<doc id="298685" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298685" title="Cylinder (geometry)">
Cylinder (geometry)

A cylinder is one of the most basic curved geometric shapes, with the surface formed by the points at a fixed distance from a given line segment, known as the axis of the cylinder. The solid enclosed by this surface and by two planes perpendicular to the axis is also called a "cylinder". The surface area and the volume of a cylinder have been known since ancient times.

In differential geometry, a cylinder is defined more broadly as any ruled surface which is spanned by a one-parameter family of parallel lines. A cylinder whose cross section is an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola is called an elliptic cylinder, parabolic cylinder, or hyperbolic cylinder respectively.

In common use a "cylinder" is taken to mean a finite section of a right circular cylinder, i.e., the cylinder with the generating lines perpendicular to the bases, with its ends closed to form two circular surfaces, as in the figure (right). If the cylinder has a radius and length (height) "h", then its volume is given by

and its surface area is:


Therefore without the top or bottom (lateral area), the surface area is:

With the top and bottom, the surface area is:

For a given volume, the cylinder with the smallest surface area has . For a given surface area, the cylinder with the largest volume has , i.e. the cylinder fits in a cube (height = diameter.)

Having a right circular cylinder with a height units and a base of radius units with the coordinate axes chosen so that the origin is at the center of one base and the height is measured along the positive x-axis. A plane section at a distance of units from the origin has an area of square units where

or

An element of volume, is a right cylinder of base area square units and a thickness of units. Thus if "V" cubic units is the volume of the right circular cylinder, by Riemann sums,

Using cylindrical coordinates, the volume can be calculated by integration over

Cylindric sections are the intersections of cylinders with planes. For a right circular cylinder, there are four possibilities. A plane tangent to the cylinder, meets the cylinder in a single straight line. Moved while parallel to itself, the plane either does not intersect the cylinder or intersects it in two parallel lines. All other planes intersect the cylinder in an ellipse or, when they are perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, in a circle.

An elliptic cylinder, or cylindroid, is a quadric surface, with the following equation in Cartesian coordinates:

This equation is for an elliptic cylinder, a generalization of the ordinary, circular cylinder (). Even more general is the generalized cylinder: the cross-section can be any curve.

The cylinder is a "degenerate quadric" because at least one of the coordinates (in this case ) does not appear in the equation.

An oblique cylinder has the top and bottom surfaces displaced from one another.

There are other more unusual types of cylinders. These are the "imaginary elliptic cylinders":

the "hyperbolic cylinder":

and the "parabolic cylinder":

In projective geometry, a cylinder is simply a cone whose apex is at infinity.

This is useful in the definition of degenerate conics, which require considering the cylindrical conics.

<doc id="298688" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298688" title="Tuning fork">
Tuning fork

A tuning fork is a sound resonator which is a two-pronged fork. The prongs, called tines, are made from a U-shaped bar of metal (usually steel). This bar of metal can move freely. It resonates at a specific constant pitch when set vibrating by striking it against an object. It sounds a pure musical tone after waiting a moment to allow some high overtone sounds to die out. The pitch depends on the length of the two prongs. Its main use is as a standard of pitch to tune other musical instruments, and in some tests of hearing.

The tuning fork was invented in 1711 by British musician John Shore. He was the Sergeant Trumpeter to the court, who had musical parts written for him by the composers George Frideric Handel and Henry Purcell.

The fork shape produces a very pure tone. Most of the vibrational energy is at the fundamental frequency, with very few overtones (harmonics). This is not the case with other resonators. The reason for this is that the frequency of the first overtone is about 5/2 = 25/4 = 6¼ times the fundamental (about 2½ octaves above it). By comparison, the first overtone of a vibrating string is only one octave above the fundamental. So when the fork is struck, little of the energy goes into the overtone modes; they also die out correspondingly faster, leaving the fundamental. It is easier to tune other instruments with this pure tone, when listening to compare with the tone of each other instrument.

Another reason for using the fork shape is that, when it vibrates in its principal mode, the handle vibrates up and down as the prongs move apart and together. There is a node (point of no vibration) at the base of each prong. The handle motion is small, allowing the fork to be held by the handle without damping the vibration, but it allows the handle to transmit the vibration to a resonator (like the hollow rectangular box often used), which amplifies the sound of the fork. Without the resonator (which may be as simple as a table top to which the handle is pressed), the sound is very faint. The reason for this is that the sound waves produced by each fork prong are 180° out of phase with the other, so at a distance from the fork they interfere and largely cancel each other out. If a sound absorbing sheet is slid in between the prongs of a vibrating fork, reducing the waves reaching the ear from one prong, the volume heard will actually increase, due to a reduction of this cancellation.

Commercial tuning forks are normally tuned to the correct pitch at the factory, but they can be retuned by filing material off the prongs. Filing the ends of the prongs raises the pitch, while filing the inside of the base of the prongs lowers it.

The most common tuning fork sounds the note of A = 440 Hz. This is the standard concert pitch, used as tuning note by some orchestras. It is the pitch of the violin's second string, the first string of the viola, and an octave above the first string of the cello, all played open. Tuning forks used by orchestras between 1750 and 1820 mostly had a frequency of A = 423.5 Hz, although there were many forks and many slightly different pitches. Standard tuning forks are available for all the musical pitches within the central octave of the piano, and other pitches. Well-known manufacturers of tuning forks include Ragg and John Walker, both of Sheffield, England.

The frequency of a tuning fork depends on its dimensions and the material from which is made:

Where:

Forks have traditionally been used to tune musical instruments, although electronic tuners are replacing them in many applications. Tuning forks can be driven electrically, by placing electromagnets close to the prongs that are attached to an electronic oscillator circuit, so that their sound does not die out.

A number of keyboard musical instruments using constructions similar to tuning forks have been made, the most popular of them being the Rhodes piano, which has hammers hitting constructions working on the same principle as tuning forks.

The Accutron, an electromechanical watch developed by Max Hetzel and manufactured by Bulova beginning in 1960, used a 360-hertz steel tuning fork powered by a battery as its timekeeping element. The fork allowed it to achieve greater accuracy than conventional balance-wheel watches. The humming sound of the tuning fork could be heard when the watch was held to the ear.

Tuning forks, usually C-512, are used by doctors to check a patient's hearing. Lower-pitched ones (usually C-128) are also used to check vibration sense as part of the examination of the peripheral nervous system.

Tuning forks are also used in alternative medicine, such as sonopuncture and polarity therapy.

Medical Tuning Fork 128 Hz

A radar gun, used to measure the speed of cars or balls in sports, is usually calibrated with tuning forks.
Instead of the frequency, these forks are labeled with the calibration speed and radar band (e.g. X-Band or K-Band) for which they are calibrated.

Doubled and H-type of tuning forks are used for tactical-grade Vibrating Structure Gyroscopes, like QuapasonTM and different types of MEMS.

St Neot (Cornwall)

St Neot is a parish and village in Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is between the towns of Bodmin and Liskeard. The parish is named after the Saxon monk, Saint Neot (who also gives his name to St Neots in Cambridgeshire). On the northern side the parish includes part of Bodmin Moor and hamlets in the parish include Draynes, Ley and Pantersbridge.

During the English Civil War St Neot was staunchly Royalist. To commemorate this, each year on Oak Apple Day (29 May), an oak branch is mounted on the top of the church tower.

The early medieval church building must have been smaller than the one in existence today and the church was rebuilt in granite in the 15th century. The fine stained glass windows are from about 1500.
The stained glass is partly original and partly from a restoration done by John Hedgeland, ca. 1830.

<doc id="298695" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298695" title="Lombe's Mill">
Lombe's Mill

Lombe's Mill was the first successful silk throwing mill in England. It was built in an island on the River Derwent in Derby. John Lombe visited Piedmont in 1717 and studied details of the Italian silk throwing machines- the "filatoio", and the "torcitoio". Then, he returned to England with some Italian craftsmen, and built the mill. George Sorocold designed the building.

Lombe's Mill was built next to Thomas Cotchett's 1704 mill on the west bank of the River Derwent in Derby. At this point a weir had been constructed across the river and the mill was built on an island downstream, which separated the river from the tail race of three corn mills. Derby was an important place, because the river had a fast flow and A6 road (from London to Carlisle) crossed the river here.

This mill is significant as it was the first successful silk throwing mill in England, and probably the first fully mechanized factory in the world. 

Thomas Cotchett built the first mill in Derby in 1704, but it was unsuccessful. So John Lombe visited Piedmont in 1716 to see the successful silk throwing mill there. This was an early example of industrial spying. He returned to Derby with the knowledge and a group of Italians. He and his half brother Thomas Lombe (born 1685) instructed George Sorocold to build a mill to his design and fitted it with the new machines. It was built to the south of Cotchetts Mill. Thomas Lombe was given a 14 year patent to protect the design of the throwing machines he used. This displeased the King of Sardinia, and he stopped exporting suitable raw silk. It is speculated that he was responsible for John Lombes mysterious death six years later in 1722. His elder brother, Thomas Lombe took over the business. When the patents lost effect in 1732, other mills were built in Stockport and Macclesfield. To the north of the powered Italian Works an unpowered Doubling Shop was built- this happened before 1739. The mill was sold in 1739 to Thomas Wilson, and an inventory of this time is still exists.

Most of the building was rebuilt in after years, and little of the original mill remain. It is known from written sources that it was five storeys high rectangular in plan. It was 17m high, 33.5m long, and 12m wide. The roof was slightly sloped. It was built of brick in flemish bond, on a series of stone arches that allowed the waters of the River Derwent to flow through. The throwing machines were two storeys high, and fastened on the first floor. The winding machines were placed on the top three floors. All the machines were powered by Sorocolds external undershot water wheel. It was 7m in diameter and 2m in width. Its stem entered the mill through a hole at first floor level. It drove a vertical shaft which was 0.45m square. This drove a line shaft (horizontal shaft or lay shaft) that ran the length of the mill. The "torcitoios" and "filatoios" took their power from this shaft. The vertical shaft was extended to a further vertical shaft that reached the top 3 floors to drive the winding machines. The mill needed to be heated in order to process the silk and this was explained in the 1718 patent. It was reported in 1732 that Lombe used a fire engine (steam engine) to pump hot air round the mill. The stair column was 19.5m high, but its layout is unknown. There is no information on how materials were carried up and down between the floors.

The main range was three storeys high, 42.4m by 5.5m. Each floor was used for doubling- and there were 306 doubling machines.

In 1700, the Italians were the most technologically advanced in silk throwing in Europe, and they had developed two machines capable of winding the silk onto bobbins while putting a twist in the thread. They called the throwing machine, a "filatoio", and the doubler, a "torcitoio". There is an illustration (drawn in 1487) of a circular handpowered throwing machine with 32 spindles. The first evidence of a externally powered filatoio comes from the thirteenth century, and the earliest illustration from around 1500. Filatorios and torcitoios contained parallel circular frames that revolved round each other on a central axis. The speed of the relative rotation determined the twist. Silk would only cooperate in the process if the temperature and humidity were high, in Italy the temperature was elevated by sunlight but in Derby the mill had to be heated, and the heat evenly distributed.

The mill then passed through several hands and has been rebuilt several times, but the modified structure still exists and has been restored to house the Derby Industrial Museum. A Bas relief sculpture of John Lombe may be found at the nearby Exeter Bridge.

The Lizard

The Lizard is a peninsula in south Cornwall, United Kingdom. The most southerly point of the British mainland is near Lizard Point at . Lizard village, the most southerly village on the British mainland, is in Landewednack, the most southerly parish.

The peninsula measures approximately x . It is southwest of Falmouth ten miles (16 km) east of Penzance.

The name "Lizard" is most probably a corruption of the Cornish name "Lys Ardh", meaning "high court". The name is not connected to the rock called serpentinite which is found here. 

The Lizard's coast is particularly hazardous to shipping and the seaways round the peninsula were historically known as the "Graveyard of Ships". The Lizard Lighthouse was built at Lizard Point in 1752 and the RNLI operates The Lizard lifeboat station.

The parishes on the peninsula proper are (west to east):

The peninsula's geology is the best preserved example of an exposed ophiolite in the United Kingdom. An ophiolite is a group of geological formations which represent a slice through a section of ocean crust thrust onto the continental crust. Geologists have identified these three parts of the rock: the serpentinites, the "oceanic complex" and the metamorphic basement.

Several nature sites exist on the Lizard Peninsula including Predannack nature reserve, Mullion Island, and Goonhilly Downs. An area of the Lizard coverning is designated a National Nature Reserve because of its coastal grasslands and heaths and inland heaths.

The Lizard contains some of the most specialised plants of any area in Britain, including many endangered species.

St Blazey

St Blazey is a small town in Cornwall, United Kingdom, in the civil parish of St Blaise. The name St Blaise is also used by the town council. The population in the 2001 census was 6632. 

St Blazey is east of St Austell. Once an important engineering centre for the local mine and railway industries, the parish is now dominated by the Eden Project.

Historically copper and tin were mined in and around the parish, whilst more recently china clay has been the principal commodity mined. The port of Par Harbour, which is in the parish, was built to make transporting these minerals easier. The Cornwall Minerals Railway, which had a depot and station in the town, was also used to move them. 
The Eden Project is within the civil parish, and about from the centre of the town. The large number of visitors this attracts has led to the development of tourism in the town.

The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus

The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus is a painting by Joseph Wright of Derby which was finished in 1771, then redone 1795. The full title of the painting is ""The Alchymist, in Search of the Philosopher’s Stone, Discovers Phosphorus, and prays for the successful Conclusion of his operation, as was the custom of the Ancient Chymical Astrologers"". It is currently on show at the Derby Museum and Art Gallery.

The picture shows an alchemist trying to produce the rare philosopher’s stone, which could turn metal into gold, but instead, to his surprise, he finds phosphorus. The picture has provoked many different understandings. The picture moved with Wright to Italy in 1773-1775, came back to England, was redone in 1795, but was only sold four years after his death. A story was often printed in popular chemical books in Wright’s lifetime, and was widely known.

The Snakeflies (Raphidioptera) are a small order of Endopterygote insects. They are closely related to the Megaloptera and Neuroptera. 

There are about 210 living species. They are easily recognized by their small head and long 'neck', which is actually the elongated prothorax. 

The snakefly, about 15 mm (0.6 inch) long, has two pairs of similar, net-veined wings, long antennae, and chewing mouthparts. The female lays eggs with a long ovipositor.

The life cycle includes egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The active and carnivorous larvae live beneath loose tree bark. The snakefly is found on every continent except Australia and may be beneficial to humans because it destroys the larvae and pupae of other insects.

The Generali Arena (till 2010 Franz-Horr-Stadion) is a football stadium in Viennas Favoriten area. It is since 1973 the homeground of FK Austria Wien. It was built in 1925 as České srdce for the SK Slovan Wien, a team of the Czech minority in Vienna. The stadium has a capacity of 13 400 and was till 2010 named after the former president of the Vienna Football Association Franz Horr.

The stadium was built in 1925 for Slovan Wien, a football team of the Czech minority of Vienna. It was called České srdce which means "czech heart". It was then the new homeground after the promotion to the first league. It was opened with a tournament with Sparta Prag, 1.Vienna FC, Amateure and Slovan itself. The first official match was slovans first in the highest league versus Hertha .Slovan won 1:0. There was a plan to build an icerink, grounds for the training and a gymnastics space for the Czechs of Favoriten but this was impossible for financial reasons. In 1935 Sk Slovan Wien was dissolved and the stadium was onlz used for amateur football bz AC Slovan Wien.

During the Second World War the stadium was damaged. So the ground did not fit for AC Slovan Wien,which plazed in the A/legue,then the highest in Austrian football. 1949 the city renovated the stadium and it was used by clubs of the Vienna Football Association.Franz Horr, the chairman, made a contract with FK Austria Wien.They played from 1973 in the stadium. After the death of Franz Horr the stadium was named after him. 

Not earlier than 1981 the stadium was renovated. Till then FK Austria played in other football stadiums in Vienna. 1982 a north stand was built,1987 the west stand,1999 the south stand and 2008 the east stand, which offers standing room only but is the home of the different fan clubs. 2000 the main office of the club came to the Horr stadium and a contract was signed with the owner who grants a 40 year long right to the club to use the stadium. Since 2010 the stadium is called Generali arena, after a sponsor from the insurance business.

Morwenstow is a parish and hamlet in north Cornwall, United Kingdom. The hamlet is situated near the coast about six miles (10 km) north of Bude.

Morwenstow is the most northerly parish in Cornwall with the Atlantic Ocean to the west and Devon to the east. As well as the churchtown, other settlements in the parish include Shop, Woodford, Gooseham, Eastcott, Wooley and West Youlstone.

Morwenstow was the home of the eccentric vicar and poet Robert Stephen Hawker (1803–1875), who is credited with reviving the custom of Harvest Festivals. The church of St Morwenna and St John the Baptist is of the Norman period. The Vicarage was built for Hawker and has chimneys in the form of the towers of various churches associated with him. The nearby coast is hazardous to shipping and the corpses of drowned sailors were laid out in the churchyard and then buried. Hawker buried over forty who were washed up within the parish boundaries.

The adults of this order possess four membranous wings, with the forewings and hindwings about the same size, and with many veins. They have chewing mouthparts, and undergo complete metamorphosis. Most of the larvae and adults are predators.

The clade first appeared in the Permian period,

Mecoptera

Mecoptera (from the Greek: "meco-" = "long", "-ptera" = "wings") are an order of insects with about 550 species in nine families worldwide. Mecoptera are sometimes called scorpionflies after their largest family Panorpidae, in which the males have enlarged genitals that look similar to the stinger of a scorpion. The Bittacidae, or hangingflies, are a prominent family of elongate insects known for their elaborate mating rituals, in which females choose mates based on the quality of gift prey offered by various males.

William John Coffee

William John Coffee (1774–1846) was a English artist and sculptor who worked in porcelain, plaster, and terra cotta. He also worked in oil paint, although this was not the thing for which he became famous. His early career was as a modeller for Duesbury at the china factory on Nottingham Road in Derby, England. The later part of his life was spent in America.

In Derby, Coffee made busts of some of the local people and historic figures including a life size sculpture of Erasmus Darwin. This bust is a good example of Coffee's modelling skills and is now on show at Derby Museum. Coffee also produced a terra cotta copy of the Florentine Boar (1806) and a number of terra cotta statues of Greek figures showing medicine and healing for the garden of Joseph Strutt. The garden was given to the town as Derby Arboretum in 1840 complete with statues, but those of the Greek figures are now missing or lost. Coffee also made a terra cotta statue of Asclepius for William Strutt's Derbyshire Infirmary, opened 1810.

Coffee moved from England to New York City in 1816, where he became famous as a sculptor for American historical figures such as James Madison and Thomas Jefferson. He also made the mouldings for Jefferson's house and for the University of Virginia.

Egloshayle

Egloshayle is a parish and village in north Cornwall, United Kingdom. The village is beside the River Camel immediately southeast of Wadebridge. The civil parish includes Washaway and Sladesbridge.

Egloshayle was a medieval river port, rivalling Padstow five miles downriver. Egloshayle is now a residential suburb of Wadebridge. The town of Wadebridge developed in the parishes of Egloshayle and St Breock. A Vicar of Egloshayle named Thomas Lovibond was responsible for the building of the first bridge across the River Camel to replace a dangerous ford which was begun in 1468 and completed in 1485.

The parish church, named after St Petroc, is built almost entirely in the Perpendicular style. It has a Norman font, a stone pulpit dating from the 15th century, and a peal of eight bells. The Anglican chapel at Washaway, dating from 1882, has a font which is one of the earliest in the county.

Pencarrow House, seat of the Molesworths (18th century), and Croan House (17th century) are fine examples of smaller country houses. 

Kelly Rounds (or Castle Killibury) is an Iron Age fort on the border of the parish and has been associated with the legend of King Arthur.

River Camel

The River Camel is a river in Cornwall, UK. It rises on the edge of Bodmin Moor and together with its tributaries drains a considerable part of North Cornwall. The river issues into the Atlantic Ocean having covered a distance of approximately 30 miles. The river is tidal as far upstream as Egloshayle and is popular for sailing, birdwatching and fishing.

The River Camel rises on the edge of Bodmin Moor, an area which forms part of the granite spine of Cornwall. The river's course is then through upper and middle Devonian rocks, predominantly slates. The only active quarry in the River Camel catchment area is Delabole Quarry. There are some disused mines for a variety of metals in the area. The catchment area of the River Camel covers a total of 413 km² on the western side of Bodmin Moor, and is mainly Devonian slates and granite, with some shales and sandstones.

Binary adder

Binary adders are devices used to add binary numbers. They are used in computers. They take two binary numbers and put them together to get a sum. In its most basic form, it uses two XOR gates, two AND gates, and an OR gate. These gates figure out what the numbers being sent in mean and if the digit needs to be turned on or not. When solving this example 1001 + 1100 (9 + 12), it would need five single bits to give an answer. The first digits in each number would go to one adder, 1 and 0. It would calculate that 1 + 0 = 1, so that first digit would be 1. The second digits from each are 0 and 0, and 0 + 0 = 0, so the second digit is 0. the third digit from each are 1 and 0, and 1 + 0 = 1, so the third digit is 1. The fourth digit in each are 1 and 1, and 1 + 1 = 10, but because this is a 2 digit number, it holds the first digit (0) and send the second digit to the next adder. The next adder sees 1, and 1 = 1, so the fith digit is 1. If we take the sum digits in order, they come out as 10101 (21), so 1001 + 1100 = 10101 (9 + 12 = 21).

<doc id="298850" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298850" title="Arithmetic precision">
Arithmetic precision

The precision of a numeric value describes the number of digits that are used to show that value. In a scientific setting, this would be the "total" number of digits (sometimes called the "significant figures" or "significant digits") or, less commonly, the number of fractional digits or decimal places (the number of digits following the decimal point). This second definition is useful in financial and engineering applications where the count of digits in the fractional part has particular importance.

In both cases, the term "precision" can be used to describe the position at which an inexact result will be rounded. For example, in floating point arithmetic, a result is rounded to a given or fixed precision, which is the length of the resulting significand. In financial calculations, a number is often rounded to a given number of places (for example, to two places after the decimal separator for many world currencies).

As an example, the decimal quantity 12.345 can be expressed with various numbers of significant digits or decimal places. If insufficient precision is available then the number is rounded in some manner to fit the available precision. The following table shows the results for various total precisions and decimal places rounded to the nearest value using the round-to-even method.

Note that it is often not appropriate to display a figure with more digits than that which can be measured. For instance, if a device measures to the nearest gram and gives a reading of 12.345 kg, it would create "false precision" if the measurement were expressed "12.34500 kg" with 2 extra zeroes ("00") at the end.

The representation of a positive number "x" to a precision of "p" significant digits has a numerical value that is given by the formula
For a negative number, the numerical value is minus that of the absolute value.
The number 0, to any precision, can be taken to be 0.

<doc id="298861" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298861" title="Rounding">
Rounding

The word "rounding" for a numerical value means replacing it by another value that is approximately equal but has a shorter, simpler, or more explicit form. For example, US$23.74 could be rounded to US$24, or the fraction 312/937 could be rounded to 1/3, or the expression formula_1 as 1.41.

Rounding is often done on purpose to obtain a value that is easier to write and handle than the original. It may be done also to indicate the accuracy of a computed number; for example, a quantity that was computed as 123,456 but is known to be accurate only to within a few hundred units is better stated as "about 123,500".

On the other hand, rounding can introduce some "round-off error" in the result. Rounding is almost unavoidable in many computations, especially when dividing two numbers in integer or fixed-point arithmetic; when computing mathematical functions such as square roots, logarithms, and sines; or when using a floating point representation with a fixed number of significant digits. In a sequence of calculations, these rounding errors generally accumulate, and in certain "ill-conditioned" cases, then they may make the result meaningless.

Accurate rounding of transcendental mathematical functions is difficult because the number of extra digits that need to be calculated to resolve whether to round up or down cannot be known in advance. This problem is known as "the table-maker's dilemma" ("below").

Rounding has many similarities to the quantization that occurs when physical quantities must be encoded by numbers or digital signals.

Typical rounding problems are:

The most common type of rounding is to round to an integer; or, more generally, to an integer multiple of some increment — such as rounding to whole tenths of seconds, hundredths of a dollar, to whole multiples of 1/2 or 1/8 inch, to whole dozens or thousands, etc..

In general, rounding a number "x" to a multiple of some specified increment "m" entails the following steps:


For example, rounding "x" = 2.1784 dollars to whole cents (i.e., to a multiple of 0.01) entails computing "y" = "x"/"m" = 2.1784/0.01 = 217.84, then rounding "y" to the integer "q" = 218, and finally computing "z" = "q"×"m" = 218×0.01 = 2.18.

When rounding to a predetermined number of significant digits, the increment "m" depends on the magnitude of the number to be rounded (or of the rounded result).

The increment "m" is normally a finite fraction in whatever numeral system that is used to represent the numbers. For display to humans, that usually means the decimal numeral system (that is, "m" is an integer times a power of 10, like 1/1000 or 25/100). For intermediate values stored in digital computers, it often means the binary numeral system ("m" is an integer times a power of 2).

The abstract single-argument "round()" function that returns an integer from an arbitrary real value has at least a dozen distinct concrete definitions presented in the rounding to integer section. The abstract two-argument "round()" function is formally defined here, but in many cases it is used with the implicit value "m" = 1 for the increment and then reduces to the equivalent abstract single-argument function, with also the same dozen distinct concrete definitions.

The most basic form of rounding is to replace an arbitrary number by an integer. All the following rounding modes are concrete implementations of the abstract single-argument "round()" function presented and used in the previous sections.

There are many ways of rounding a number "y" to an integer "q". The most common ones are

The first four methods are called directed rounding, as the displacements from the original number "y" to the rounded value "q" are all directed towards or away from the same limiting value (0, +∞, or −∞).

If "y" is positive, round-down is the same as round-towards-zero, and round-up is the same as round-away-from-zero. If "y" is negative, round-down is the same as round-away-from-zero, and round-up is the same as round-towards-zero. In any case, if "y" is integer, "q" is just "y". The following table illustrates these rounding methods:

Where many calculations are done in sequence, the choice of rounding method can have a very significant effect on the result. A famous instance involved a new index set up by the Vancouver Stock Exchange in 1982. It was initially set at 1000.000, and after 22 months had fallen to about 520 — whereas stock prices had generally increased in the period. The problem was caused by the index being recalculated thousands of times daily, and always being rounded down to 3 decimal places, in such a way that the rounding errors accumulated. Recalculating with better rounding gave an index value of 1098.892 at the end of the same period.

Rounding a number "y" to the nearest integer requires some tie-breaking rule for those cases when "y" is exactly half-way between two integers — that is, when the fraction part of "y" is exactly 0.5.

The following tie-breaking rule, called round half up (or round half towards plus infinity), is widely used in many disciplines. That is, half-way values "y" are always rounded up. 


For example, by this rule the value 23.5 gets rounded to 24, but −23.5 gets rounded to −23.

This is one of two rules generally taught in US elementary mathematics classes.

If it were not for the 0.5 fractions, the roundoff errors introduced by the round to nearest method would be quite symmetric: for every fraction that gets rounded up (such as 0.268), there is a complementary fraction (namely, 0.732) that gets rounded down, by the same amount. When rounding a large set of numbers with random fractional parts, these rounding errors would statistically compensate each other, and the expected (average) value of the rounded numbers would be equal to the expected value of the original numbers.

However, the "round half up" tie-breaking rule is not symmetric, as the fractions that are exactly 0.5 always get rounded up. This asymmetry introduces a positive bias in the roundoff errors. For example, if the fraction of "y" consists of three random decimal digits, then the expected value of "q" will be 0.0005 higher than the expected value of "y". For this reason, round-to-nearest with the "round half up" rule is also (ambiguously) known as asymmetric rounding.

One reason for rounding up at 0.5 is that only one digit need be examined. When seeing 17.50000..., for example, the first three figures, 17.5, determines that the figure would be rounded up to 18. If the opposite rule were used (round half down), then all the zero decimal places would need to be examined to determine if the value is exactly 17.5.

One may also use round half down (or round half towards minus infinity) as opposed to the more common "round half up" (the "round half up" method is a common convention, but is nothing more than a convention).


For example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and −23.5 gets rounded to −24.

The "round half down" tie-breaking rule is not symmetric, as the fractions that are exactly 0.5 always get rounded down. This asymmetry introduces a negative bias in the roundoff errors. For example, if the fraction of "y" consists of three random decimal digits, then the expected value of "q" will be 0.0005 lower than the expected value of "y". For this reason, round-to-nearest with the "round half down" rule is also (ambiguously) known as asymmetric rounding.

The other tie-breaking method commonly taught and used is the round half away from zero (or round half towards infinity), namely:


For example, 23.5 gets rounded to 24, and −23.5 gets rounded to −24.

This method treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. However, this rule will still introduce a positive bias for positive numbers, and a negative bias for the negative ones.

It is often used for currency conversions and price roundings (when the amount is first converted into the smallest significant subdivision of the currency, such as cents of a euro) as it is easy to explain by just considering the first fractional digit, independently of supplementary precision digits or sign of the amount (for strict equivalence between the paying and recipient of the amount).

One may also round half towards zero (or round half away from infinity) as opposed to the more common "round half away from zero" (the "round half away from zero" method is a common convention, but is nothing more than a convention).


For example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and −23.5 gets rounded to −23.

This method also treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. However, this rule will still introduce a negative bias for positive numbers, and a positive bias for the negative ones.

A tie-breaking rule that is even less biased is round half to even, namely


Thus, for example, +23.5 becomes +24, +22.5 becomes +22, −22.5 becomes −22, and −23.5 becomes −24.

This method also treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. In addition, for most reasonable distributions of "y" values, the expected (average) value of the rounded numbers is essentially the same as that of the original numbers, even if the latter are all positive (or all negative). However, this rule will still introduce a positive bias for even numbers (including zero), and a negative bias for the odd ones.

This variant of the round-to-nearest method is also called unbiased rounding (ambiguously, and a bit abusively), convergent rounding, statistician's rounding, Dutch rounding, Gaussian rounding, or bankers' rounding. This is widely used in bookkeeping.

This is the default rounding mode used in IEEE 754 computing functions and operators.

Another tie-breaking rule that is very similar to round half to even, namely


Thus, for example, +22.5 becomes +23, +21.5 becomes +21, −21.5 becomes −21, and −22.5 becomes −23.

This method also treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. In addition, for most reasonable distributions of "y" values, the expected (average) value of the rounded numbers is essentially the same as that of the original numbers, even if the latter are all positive (or all negative). However, this rule will still introduce a negative bias for even numbers (including zero), and a positive bias for the odd ones.

This variant is almost never used in most computations, except in situations where one wants to avoid rounding 0.5 or −0.5 to zero, or to avoid increasing the scale of numbers represented as floating point (with limited ranges for the scaling exponent), so that a non "infinite" number would round to infinite, or that a small "denormal" value would round to a normal non-zero value (these could occur with the "round half to even" mode). Effectively, this mode prefers preserving the existing scale of tie numbers, avoiding out of range results when possible.

Another unbiased tie-breaking method is stochastic rounding:


Like round-half-to-even, this rule is essentially free of overall bias; but it is also fair among even and odd "q" values. On the other hand, it introduces a random component into the result; performing the same computation twice on the same data may yield two different results. Also, it is open to subconscious bias if humans (rather than computers or devices of chance) are "randomly" deciding in which direction to round.

One method, more obscure than most, is round half alternatingly.


This suppresses the random component of the result, if occurrences of 0.5 fractional parts can be effectively numbered. But it can still introduce a positive or negative bias according to the direction of rounding assigned to the first occurrence, if the total number of occurrences is odd.

In some contexts, all the rounding methods above may be unsatisfactory. For example, suppose that "y" is an accurate measurement of an audio signal, which is being rounded to an integer "q" in order to reduce the storage or transmission costs. If "y" changes slowly with time, any of the rounding method above will result in "q" being completely constant for long intervals, separated by sudden jumps of ±1. When the "q" signal is played back, these steps will be heard as a very disagreeable noise, and any variations of the original signal between two integer values will be completely lost. 

One way to avoid this problem is to round each value "y" upwards with probability equal to its fraction, and round it downwards with the complement of that probability. For example, the number 23.17 would be rounded up to 24 with probability 0.17, and down to 23 with probability 1 − 0.17 = 0.83. (This is equivalent to rounding down "y" + "s", where "s" is a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.) With this special rounding, known as dithering, the sudden steps get replaced by a less objectionable noise, and even small variations in the original signal will be preserved to some extent. Like the stochastic approach to tie-breaking, dithering has no bias: if all fraction values are equally likely, rounding up by a certain amount is as likely as rounding down by that same amount; and the same is true for the sum of several rounded numbers. On the other hand, dithering introduces a random component in the result, much greater than that of stochastic tie-breaking.

More precisely, the roundoff error for each dithered number will be a uniformly distributed random variable with mean value of zero, but with a standard deviation formula_11, which is better than the 1/2 standard deviation with the simple predictive methods, but slightly higher than with the simpler stochastic method. However, the sum of "n" rounded numbers will be a random variable with expected error zero, but with standard deviation formula_12 (the total remaining noise) which diverges semi-quadratically and may become easily perceptible, even if the standard deviation of the roundoff error per sample will be formula_13 which slowly converges semi-quadratically to zero. So, this random distribution may still be too high for some applications that are rounding a lot of data.

This variant of the simple dithering method still rounds values with probability equal to its fraction. However, instead of using a random distribution for rounding isolated samples, the roundoff error occurring at each rounded sample is totalled for the next surrounding elements to sample or compute; this accumulated value is then added to the value of these next sampled or computed values to round, so that the modified values will take into account this difference using a predictive model (such as Floyd–Steinberg dithering).

The modified values are then rounded with any one of the above rounding methods, the best ones being with stochastic or dithering methods: in this last case, the sum of "n" rounded numbers will still be a random variable with expected error zero but with an excellent constant standard deviation of formula_14, instead of diverging semi-quadratically when dithering isolated samples; and the overall average roundoff error deviation per rounded sample will be formula_15 that will converge hyperbolically to zero, faster than with the semi-hyperbolic convergence when dithering isolated samples.

In practice, when rounding large sets of sampled data (such as audio, image and video rendering), the accumulation of roundoff errors is most frequently used with a simple predictive rounding of the modified values (such as rounding towards zero), because it will still preserve the hyperbolic convergence towards zero of the overall mean roundoff error bias and of its standard deviation. This enhancement is frequently used in image and audio processing (notably for accurate rescaling and antialiasing operations, where the simple probabilistic dithering of isolated values may still produce perceptible noise, sometimes even worse than the moiré effects occurring with simple non-probabilistic rounding methods applied to isolated samples).

The effective propagation of accumulated roundoff errors may depend on the discrete dimension of the sampled data to round: when sampling bidimensional images, including colored images (that add the discrete dimension of color planes), or tridimensional videos (that add a discrete time dimension), or on polyphonic audio data (using time and channel discrete dimensions), it may still be preferable to propagate this error into a preferred direction, or equally into several orthogonal dimensions, such as vertically vs. horizontally for bidimensional images, or into parallel color channels at the same position and/or timestamp, and depending on other properties of these orthogonal discrete dimensions (according to a perception model). In those cases, several roundoff error accumulators may be used (at least one for each discrete dimension), or a ("n"-1)-dimension vector (or matrix) of accumulators.

In some of these cases, the discrete dimensions of the data to sample and round may be treated non orthogonally: for example, when working with colored images, the trichromatic color planes data in each physical dimension (height, width and optionally time) could be remapped using a perceptive color model, so that the roundoff error accumulators will be designed to preserve lightness with a higher probability than hue or saturation, instead of propagating errors into each orthogonal color plane independently; and in stereophonic audio data the two rounded data channels (left and right) may be rounded together to preserve their mean value in priority to their effective difference that will absorb most of the remaining roundoff errors, in a balanced way around zero.

In some contexts it is desirable to round a given number "x" to a "neat" fraction — that is, the nearest fraction "z" = "m"/"n"
whose numerator "m" and denominator "n" do not exceed a given maximum. This problem is fairly distinct from that of rounding a value to a fixed number of decimal or binary digits, or to a multiple of a given unit "m". This problem is related to Farey sequences, the Stern-Brocot tree, and continued fractions.

This type of rounding, which is also named rounding to a logarithmic scale, is a variant of Rounding to a specified increment but with an increment that is modified depending on the scale and magnitude of the result. Concretely, the intent is to limit the number of significant digits, rounding the value so that non-significant digits will be dropped. This type of rounding occurs implicitly with numbers computed with floating-point values with limited precision (such as IEEE-754 "float" and "double" types), but it may be used more generally to round any real values with any positive number of significant digits and any strictly positive real base.

For example it can be used in engineering graphics for representing data with a logarithmic scale with variable steps (for example wave lengths, whose base is not necessarily an integer measure), or in statistical data to define classes of real values within intervals of exponentially growing widths (but the most common use is with integer bases such as 10 or 2).

This type of rounding is based on a logarithmic scale defined by a fixed non-zero real scaling factor "s" (in most frequent cases this factor is "s"=1) and a fixed positive base "b">1 (not necessarily an integer and most often different from the scaling factor), and a fixed integer number "n">0 of significant digits in that base (which will determine the value of the increment to use for rounding, along with the computed effective scale of the rounded number).

The primary argument number (as well as the resulting rounded number) is first represented in exponential notation "x" = "s"·"a"·"m"·"b", such that the sign "s" is either +1 or −1, the absolute mantissa "a" is restricted to the half-open positive interval [1/"b",1), and the exponent "c" is any (positive or negative) integer. In that representation, all significant digits are in the fractional part of the absolute mantissa whose integer part is always zero.

If the source number (or rounded number) is 0, the absolute mantisssa "a" is defined as 0, the exponent "c" is fixed to an arbitrary value (0 in most conventions, but some floating-point representations cannot use a null absolute mantissa but reserve a specific maximum negative value for the exponent "c" to represent the number 0 itself), and the sign "s" may be arbitrarily chosen between −1 or +1 (it is generally set to +1 for simple zero, or it is set to the same sign as the argument in the rounded value if the number representation allows to differentiate positive and negative zeroes, even if they finally represent the same numeric value 0).

A scaled exponential representation as "x" = "a"·"s"·"b" may also be used equivalently, with a signed mantissa "a" either equal to zero or within one of the two half-open intervals (−1,−1/"b"] and [+1/"b",+1), and this will be the case in the algorithm below.

The steps to compute this scaled rounding are generally similar to the following:

For the abstract "round()" function, this type of rounding can use any one of the "rounding to integer" modes described more completely in the next section, but it is most frequently the "round to nearest" mode (with tie-breaking rules also described more completely below).

For example:

Finished lumber, writing paper, capacitors, and many other products are usually sold in only a few standard sizes.

Many design procedures describe how to calculate an approximate value, and then "round" to some standard size using phrases such as "round down to nearest standard value", "round up to nearest standard value", or "round to nearest standard value".

When a set of preferred values is equally spaced on a logarithmic scale,
Choosing the closest preferred value to any given value can be seen as a kind of scaled rounding.
Such "rounded" values can be directly calculated.

In floating-point arithmetic, rounding aims to turn a given value "x" into a value "z" with a specified number of "significant" digits. In other words, "z" should be a multiple of a number "m" that depends on the magnitude of "z". The number "m" is a power of the base (usually 2 or 10) of the floating-point form.

Apart from this detail, all the variants of rounding discussed above apply to the rounding of floating-point numbers as well. The algorithm for such rounding is presented in the Scaled rounding section above, but with a constant scaling factor "s"=1, and an integer base "b">1.

For results where the rounded result would overflow the result for a directed rounding is either the appropriate signed infinity, or the highest representable positive finite number (or the lowest representable negative finite number if "x" is negative), depending on the direction of rounding. The result of an overflow for the usual case of "round to even" is always the appropriate infinity.

In addition, if the rounded result would underflow, i.e. if the exponent would exceed the lowest representable integer value, the effective result may be either zero (possibly signed if the representation can maintain a distinction of signs for zeroes), or the smallest representable positive finite number (or the highest representable negative finite number if "x" is negative), possibly a "denormal" positive or negative number (if the mantissa is storing all its significant digits, in which case the most significant digit may still be stored in a lower position by setting the highest stored digits to zero, and this stored mantissa does not drop the most significant digit, something that is possible when base "b"=2 because the most significant digit is always 1 in that base), depending on the direction of rounding. The result of an underflow for the usual case of "round to even" is always the appropriate zero.

Rounding a number twice in succession to different precisions, with the latter precision being coarser, is not guaranteed to give the same result as rounding once to the final precision except in the case of directed rounding. For instance rounding 9.46 to one decimal gives 9.5, and then 10 when rounding to integer using rounding half to even, but would give 9 when rounded to integer directly.

Some computer languages and the IEEE 754-2008 standard dictate that in straightforward calculations, the result should not be rounded twice. This has been a particular problem with Java as it is designed to be run identically on different machines, special programming tricks have had to be used to achieve this with x87 floating point.
The Java language was changed to allow different results where the difference does not matter and require a "strictfp" qualifier to be used when the results have to conform accurately.

It is possible to use rounded arithmetic to evaluate the exact value of a function with a discrete domain and range. For example, if we know that an integer "n" is a perfect square, we can compute its square root by converting "n" to a floating-point value "x", computing the approximate square root "y" of "x" with floating point, and then rounding "y" to the nearest integer "q". If "n" is not too big, the floating-point roundoff error in "y" will be less than 0.5, so the rounded value "q" will be the exact square root of "n". In most modern computers, this method may be much faster than computing the square root of "n" by an all-integer algorithm.

William Kahan coined the term "The Table-Maker's Dilemma" for the unknown cost of rounding transcendental functions:

The IEEE floating point standard guarantees that add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root, and floating point remainder will give the correctly rounded result of the infinite precision operation. However, no such guarantee is given for more complex functions and they are typically only accurate to within the last bit at best.

Using the Gelfond–Schneider theorem and Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem, many of the standard elementary functions can be proved to return transcendental results when given rational non-zero arguments; therefore it is always possible to correctly round such functions. However determining a limit for a given precision on how accurate results needs to be computed before a correctly rounded result can be guaranteed may demand a lot of computation time.

There are some packages around now that offer full accuracy. The MPFR package gives correctly rounded arbitrary precision results. IBM has written a package for fast and accurate IEEE elementary functions and in the future the standard libraries may offer such precision.

It is possible to devise well-defined computable numbers which it may never be possible to correctly round no matter how many digits are calculated. For instance, if Goldbach's conjecture is true but unprovable, then it is impossible to correctly round down 0.5 + 10 where n is the first even number greater than 4 which is not the sum of two primes, or 0.5 if there is no such number. This can however be approximated to any given precision even if the conjecture is unprovable.

The concept of rounding is very old, perhaps older even than the concept of division. Some ancient clay tablets found in Mesopotamia contain tables with rounded values of reciprocals and square roots in base 60.
Rounded approximations to π, the length of the year, and the length of the month are also ancient.

The "Round-to-even" method has served as the ASTM (E-29) standard since 1940. The origin of the terms "unbiased rounding" and "statistician's rounding" are fairly self-explanatory. In the 1906 4th edition of "Probability and Theory of Errors" Robert Simpson Woodward called this "the computer's rule" indicating that it was then in common use by human computers who calculated mathematical tables. Churchill Eisenhart's 1947 paper "Effects of Rounding or Grouping Data" (in "Selected Techniques of Statistical Analysis", McGrawHill, 1947, Eisenhart, Hastay, and Wallis, editors) indicated that the practice was already "well established" in data analysis.

The origin of the term "bankers' rounding" remains more obscure. If this rounding method was ever a standard in banking, the evidence has proved extremely difficult to find. To the contrary, section 2 of the European Commission report "The Introduction of the Euro and the Rounding of Currency Amounts" suggests that there had previously been no standard approach to rounding in banking; and it specifies that "half-way" amounts should be rounded up.

Until the 1980s, the rounding method used in floating-point computer arithmetic was usually fixed by the hardware, poorly documented, inconsistent, and different for each brand and model of computer. This situation changed after the IEEE 754 floating point standard was adopted by most computer manufacturers. The standard allows the user to choose among several rounding modes, and in each case, specifies precisely how the results should be rounded. These features made numerical computations more predictable and machine-independent, and made possible the efficient and consistent implementation of interval arithmetic.

Most programming languages provide functions or special syntax to round fractional numbers in various ways. The earliest numeric languages, such as FORTRAN and C, would provide only one method, usually truncation (towards zero). This default method could be implied in certain contexts, such as when assigning a fractional number to an integer variable , or using a fractional number as an index of an array. Other kinds of rounding had to be programmed explicitly; for example, rounding a positive number to the nearest integer could be implemented by adding 0.5 and truncating.

In the last decades, however, the syntax and/or the standard libraries of most languages have commonly provided at least the four basic rounding functions (up/ceiling, down/floor, to nearest, and towards zero). The tie-breaking method may vary depending the language and version, and/or may be selectable by the programmer. Several languages follow the lead of the IEEE-754 floating-point standard, and define these functions as taking a double precision float argument and returning the result of the same type, which then may be converted to an integer if necessary. Since the IEEE double precision format has 52 fraction bits, this approach may avoid spurious overflows in languages have 32-bit integers. Some languages, such as PHP, provide functions that round a value to a specified number of decimal digits, e.g. from 4321.5678 to 4321.57 or 4300. In addition, many languages provide a "printf" or similar string formatting function, which allows one to convert a fractional number to a string, rounded to a user-specified number of decimal places (the "precision"). On the other hand, truncation (round to zero) is still the default rounding method used by many languages, especially for the division of two integer values.

On the opposite, CSS and SVG do not define any specific maximum precision for numbers and measurements, that are treated and exposed in their Document Object Model and in their Interface-description-language interface as strings as if they had infinite precision, and do not discriminate between integers and floating point values; however, the implementations of these languages will typically convert these numbers into IEEE-754 double floating points before exposing the computed digits with a limited precision (notably within standard Javascript or ECMAScript interface bindings).

Some disciplines or institutions have issued standards or directives for rounding.

In a guideline issued in mid-1966, the U.S. Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology determined that weather data should be rounded to the nearest round number, with the "round half up" tie-breaking rule. For example, 1.5 rounded to integer should become 2, and −1.5 should become −1. Prior to that date, the tie-breaking rule was "round half away from zero".

Some meteorologists may write "−0" to indicate a temperature between 0.0 and −0.5 degrees (exclusive) that was rounded to integer. This notation is used when the negative sign is considered important, no matter how small is the magnitude; for example, when rounding temperatures in the Celsius scale, where below zero indicates freezing.

Kočevski Rog butchery

Kočevski Rog butchery was a serial massacre when thousands of people, such as the Slovene Home Guard and their families, were executed by special units of the communist Yugoslav soldiers in late May 1945. They were thrown into various pits and caves, which were then sealed with explosives. Several thousand (between 10,000 and 12,000, according to certain sources) war prisoners, repatriated by the British military authorities from Austria, where they had fled, died in these post-war summary executions.

The Russian British author Nikolai Tolstoy wrote an account of the events in his book "The Minister and the Massacres". British author John Corsellis, who served in Austria with the British Army, has written a historic book of these events, called ""Slovenia 1945: Memories of Death and Survival after World War II"".

Boris Karapandzic writes that there were 12,000 Slovenian "home guards," 3,000 Serbian volunteer troops, 1,000 Montenegrin "chetniks," and 2,500 Croatian "home guards." Karapandzic's report is confirmed in subsequent book by a group of scholars.

St Dennis, Cornwall

St Dennis is a parish and village in Cornwall, United Kingdom. The village is on the B3279 road between Newquay and St Austell.

St Dennis had a population of 2,696 in the 2001 census. The village is famous for its church built on the site of an Iron Age hillfort. The area is full of tips and clay pits of china clay mining but St Dennis village itself is designated an 'island settlement' which prevents encroachment by the china clay industry. Much of the parish is up to 500 feet above sea level, and the countryside is moorland with small fields enclosed by 'Cornish hedges'.

The church is on top of a hill overlooking the village and has views to the sea at Newquay. It stands on the site of an Iron Age fort. The tower is the oldest part of the church, and the newer church has been repaired after being destroyed by fire in 1985. The village also has a strong history of Methodism and once had three Methodist chapels, two of these are still in use.

<doc id="298891" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298891" title="Cornish Rebellion of 1497">
Cornish Rebellion of 1497

The Cornish Rebellion of 1497 was a popular uprising by the people of Cornwall in the far southwest of Britain. Its primary cause was the people's response to the raising of war taxes by King Henry VII to pay for a campaign against Scotland. Tin miners were angered as the scale of the taxes overturned previous rights granted by Edward I of England to the Cornish Stannary Parliament which exempted Cornwall from all taxes of 10ths or 15ths of income.

In reaction to King Henry's tax levy, Michael Joseph (An Gof), a blacksmith from St Keverne and Thomas Flamank a lawyer from Bodmin, persuaded many of the people of Cornwall to revolt against the King. An army of 15,000 marched into Devon, attracting support in terms of provisions and recruits as they went. Apart from one isolated incident at Taunton their march was not accompanied by any violence or looting. From Taunton, they moved on to Wells, where they were joined by the seventh Baron Audley, an able soldier. 

After issuing a declaration of grievances, the army left Wells and marched to Winchester via Bristol and Salisbury, remarkably unopposed as they progressed across the south of England. At this point, having come so far, there seems to have been some questioning of what exactly should be done. Flamank proposed that they should head for Kent, 'the classic soil of protests', the home of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 and Jack Cade's rebellion, to rally the volatile men of Kent to their banner. Having failed to attract support in Kent part of the army abandoned the march and returned home while the rest turned towards Surrey.

Moving back west, by Tuesday 13 June 1497 the Cornish army arrived at Guildford. Although shocked by the scale of the revolt, Henry VII had not been idle. The army of 8000 men assembled for Scotland was recalled. The same day that the Cornish arrived at Guildford, Lord Daubeney and his army took up position upon Hounslow Heath and were cheered by the arrival of food and wine dispatched by the Lord Mayor of London.

The Crown decided to take the offensive and test the strength and resolve of the Cornish forces. Lord Daubeney sent out a force of 500 mounted spearmen and they clashed with the Cornish at 'Gill Down' outside Guildford on Wednesday 14 June 1497.

The Cornish army left Guildford and moved via Banstead and Chussex Plain to Blackheath where they pitched their final camp, looking down from the hill onto the Thames and City of London. Somehow An Gof held his army together, but faced with overwhelming odds, some Cornish deserted and by morning there remained only some 9-10,000 Cornish stalwarts left in arms.

The Battle of Deptford Bridge (also known as Battle of Blackheath) took place on 17 June 1497 on a site in present-day Deptford south-east London, near the River Ravensbourne and was the climax of the Cornish Rebellion. Henry VII had an army of some 25,000 men and the Cornish lacked the supporting cavalry and artillery arms essential to the professional forces of the time. After carefully spreading rumours that he would attack on the following Monday, Henry moved against the Cornish at dawn on Saturday (17 June 1497). The Royal forces were divided into three 'battles', two under Lords Oxford, Essex and Suffolk, to wheel round the right flank and rear of enemy whilst the third waited in reserve. When the Cornish were duly surrounded, Lord Daubeney and the third 'battle' were ordered into frontal attack.

At the bridge at Deptford Strand, the Cornish had placed a body of archers to block the passage of the river. Here Daubeney had a hot time of it before his spearmen eventually captured the crossing with some losses (a mere 8 men or as many as 300 depending on one's source). Through ill-advice or inexperience, the Cornish had neglected to provide support for the men at Deptford Strand bridge and the main array stood well back into the heath, near to the top of the hill. Lord Daubeney and his troops poured across in strength and engaged the enemy with great vigour. Daubeney himself was so carried away that he became isolated from his men and was captured. Astoundingly enough, the Cornish simply released him and he soon returned to the fray.

The two other Royal divisions attacked the Cornish precisely as planned and, as Bacon succinctly put it: being ill-armed and ill-led, and without horse or artillery, they were with no great difficulty cut in pieces and put to flight. Estimates of the Cornish dead range from 200 to 2000 and a general slaughter of the broken army was well under way when An Gof gave the order for surrender. He fled but only got as far as Greenwich before being captured. The less enterprising Lord Audley and Thomas Flamank were taken on the field of battle.

By 2pm, Henry VII had returned to the City in triumph, knighting deserving parties on the way, to accept the acclamation of the Mayor and attend a service of thanksgiving at St Paul's.

In due course, severe monetary penalties, extracted by Crown agents, pauperised sections of Cornwall for years to come. Prisoners were sold into slavery and estates were seized and handed to more loyal subjects. The remaining rebels that escaped went home ending the rebellion.

An Gof and Flamank were both executed at Tyburn, London on 27 June 1497. An Gof is recorded to have said before his execution that he should have ""a name perpetual and a fame permanent and immortal"". Thomas Flamank was quoted as saying ""Speak the truth and only then can you be free of your chains"". Audley, as a peer of the realm, was beheaded on the 28th June at Tower Hill, London.

In 1997 a statue depicting the Cornish leaders, "Michael An Gof" and Thomas Flamank was unveiled at An Gof's home village of St Keverne and a commemorative plaque was also unveiled on Blackheath Common.

Hersal Thomas

Hersal Thomas (* 1910 in Houston; † 3. Juli 1926 in Detroit, Michigan) was an American blues and boogie woogie pianist who influenced strongly the development of piano blues and boogie woogie. Later pianists like Jimmy Yancey, Albert Ammons and Meade Lux Lewis named him as most important influence for their own career.
Thomas was born in Houston, Texas into a musical family. He showed early talent for blues piano playing and composition. Beside Hersal also his older brother George W. was a very good piano player. His sister Sippie Wallace and his nice Hociel Thomas sang.

He started playing piano in New Orleans but went on to Chicago, where his sister Sippie lived. 1924 he started recording piano rolls and 1925 disk records. He worked solo but also as sideman for Hociel Thomas, Sippie Wallace, Lilian Miller and Sodarisa Miller. Shortly before his death he was on tour with Louis Amstrong and King Oliver. His sister Sippie Wallacerecorded seven of his titels: „A Jealous Woman Like Me“, „A Man for Every Day of the Week“, „Dead Drunk Blues“, „Have You Ever Been Down?“, „I Feel Good“, „Shorty George Blues“ und „Trouble Everywhere I Roam“. His most famous records are „Suitcase Blues“ (8958-A Okeh 8227) and "The Five". Albert Ammons and Meade Lux Lewis named this records under the fundamental boogie records.

Thomas died of food poisoning while working at Penny's Pleasure Inn in Detroit, Michigan.

Shuttle

A shuttle is a tool designed to neatly and compactly store weft yarn while weaving. Shuttles are thrown or passed back and forth through the shed, between the yarn threads of the warp in order to weave in the weft.

The simplest shuttles, known as "stick shuttles", are made from a flat, narrow piece of wood with notches on the ends to hold the weft yarn. More complicated shuttles incorporate bobbins or pirns.

Shuttles are often made of wood from the Flowering Dogwood, because it is so hard, resists splintering, and can be polished to a very smooth finish.

Originally shuttles were passed back and forth by hand. However, "John Kay" invented a loom in 1733 that incorporated a "flying shuttle". This shuttle could be thrown through the warp, which allowed much wider cloth to be woven much more quickly and made the development of machine looms much simpler.

River Fal

The River Fal flows through Cornwall, United Kingdom, rising on the Goss Moor (between St. Columb and St Austell) and reaching the English Channel at Falmouth. The River Fal separates the Roseland Peninsula from the rest of Cornwall. The Fal estuary is a classic ria, or drowned river valley, caused by rising sea levels.

The origin and meaning of the name of the river are unknown. The earliest occurrences of the name are in documents of 969 and 1049 AD. Falmouth, a town which was known by another name until the 17th century, is named after the River Fal.

The catchment of the Fal is predominantly Devonian slates, shales and grits, with granite in the upper reaches. Land use is mainly agricultural with some woodland.

Tributaries of the River Fal include the River Truro, River Kennal, River Penryn and River Carnon. Several tidal creeks discharge into the River Fal including the Helford River, Mylor Creek, Pill Creek, Penpol Creek and Restronguet Creek.

The river is crossed by the historic and scenic King Harry Ferry, a vehicular chain ferry that links the villages of Feock and Philleigh.

<doc id="298932" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298932" title="Laser tag">
Laser tag

Laser tag, what is now considered a game, started out as a military training excersize. In the beginning laser guns and the laser targets worn on the soldiers bodies were not connected, this means that the soldiers were able to continue firing the gun even if they had been tagged. One other problem was that they could just reboot the packs, essentially getting their second life, which does not happen on the battle field.

Laser tag does not actually use lasers for the actual tagging device, it utilizes infrared leds that are focused with mirrors.

Todays laser tag systems work on the following, you where a sensor pack that is attached to the pack, your pack is wireless and reports back to a master computer that tabulates the amount of times that you were hit or hit someone else. When you pull the trigger, the infrared LED lights up, but the infrared can not be seen by humans. The packs sensors are actively looking for Infrared lights, if you are in range your pack will register the hit. the part of the laser tag beam that you can see is sometimes a laser or a very bright focused red LED. 

In earlier versions of laser tag the packs sensed light, this was bad, because you needed to large area to play, you were usually in view of the sun, you often got false tags with the sun.

Crush (drink)

Crush is a soft drink made by the Dr Pepper Snapple Group. 
Crush was founded in 1911 with Clayton Howell and Neil Ward when they began working together on the project. After many attempts, Ward had made the process of mixing the ingredients to make the all-natural taste of Orange Crush. Howell had already made his own drink, Howell’s Orange Julep, as soft drinks usually were named after the maker and the drink name. In this case, Crush was released under the name Ward's Orange Crush. In fact, the company who made Orange Crush drink added orange pulp to the drink to make drinkers think that it was made from fresh squeezed oranges. However, pulp has not been in the drink for the past few decades.

In 1980, Crush was sold to Procter & Gamble. Then in 1989, Cadbury Schweppes bought Crush from Procter & Gamble. Cadbury then made their drink business and called it Dr Pepper Snapple Group.

Lanhydrock is a parish centred on a country estate and mansion in Cornwall, United Kingdom. The parish lies south of the town of Bodmin and is bounded to the north by Bodmin parish, to the south by Lanlivery parish and to the west by Lanivet parish. The population was 171 in the 2001 census. 

The parish is in the Diocese of Truro. The parish church is dedicated to St Hydrock and stands in the grounds of Lanhydrock House. Parts date back to the late 15th century and the church has a chancel, nave, north and south aisles and three-stage battlemented tower with one bell.

The great house stands in extensive grounds above the River Fowey and is has been owned and managed by the National Trust since 1953. Much of the present house dates back to Victorian times but some sections date from the 1620s. It is a Grade I listed building and is set in gardens with formal areas. The hill behind the house is planted with a fine selection of shrubs and trees.

In 1620 wealthy merchant Sir Richard Robartes acquired the estate and began building Lanhydrock House, designed to a four-sided layout around a central courtyard. Robartes died in 1624 but work on the building was continued by his son John Robartes, 1st Earl of Radnor. During the 18th century the east wing of the house was demolished leaving the U-shaped plan seen today. In 1881 a major fire destroyed the south wing and caused much damage to the central section. Of the main house only the north wing, with its 29 metre Long Gallery, and the front porch building survived intact, though the original gatehouse also dates back to the mid 17th century.

Kestrel

The Common Kestrel ("Falco tinnunculus") is a bird of prey species belonging to the kestrel group of the falcon family Falconidae. It is also known as the European Kestrel, Eurasian Kestrel, or Old World Kestrel. In Britain, where no other brown falcon occurs, it is generally just called "the kestrel". The bird lives all over Europe, Asia, and Africa.

Common Kestrels are 32–39 cm (13–15 in) from head to tail. Their wings are 65–82 cm (26–32 in) when spread out. Females are larger. They are small compared with other birds of prey, but larger than most songbirds. Like the other "Falco" species, they have long wings and a long tail.

Their feathers are mainly light brown with black spots on the top and buff with narrow blackish streaks on the underside.
When hunting, the Common Kestrel hovers about 10–20 m (c.30–70 ft) above the ground. Common Kestrels have very good eyesight. They can see small prey from a distance. Once they see the prey, the bird makes a short, steep dive. Common Kestrels eat nearly only mouse-sized mammals like voles. They also eat shrews and true mice. Small birds are also eaten, mostly in the summer when young birds are born. It also eats spiders and beetles when it finds them.

Peer group

A peer group is a group of people who are equal in some way. Those in a peer group have the same status and are about the same age. They often interact with the group as a whole. Members of a peer group often have similar interests and backgrounds. 

Developmental psychologists, Lev Vygotsky, Jean Piaget, Erik Erikson, and Harry Stack Sullivan, argued that peer relationships are important in a person's development, and teach about equality, reciprocity, cooperation, and intimacy. Modern research also shows that social and emotional gains are indeed provided by peer interaction.

Judith Rich Harris, in "The Nurture Assumption," argues that an individual's peer group significantly influences their intellectual and personal development. Several long-term studies also claim that peer groups improve school work.

<doc id="299188" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299188" title="Diet soda">
Diet soda

Diet sodas (or diet pop, diet, sugar-free, or light soft drinks, refreshments, or carbonated beverages) are usually sugar-free, artificially sweetened, non-alcoholic carbonated beverages targeted towards health-conscious people, diabetics, athletes, and other people who want to lose weight, improve physical fitness, or reduce how much sugar they eat.

Different artificial sweeteners are used instead of sugar to give diet soda a sweet taste and some are often used combined with one another. Opinion is mixed as to the taste of these beverages: some think they lack the taste of their sugar-sweetened counterparts, others think the taste is similar. Some also say that there is an unusual non-sugary aftertaste. Some feel the other way—that diet soda has no aftertaste and that soda sweetened by high fructose corn syrup has a gritty, over-sweet aftertaste.
Aspartame, commonly known by the brand name NutraSweet, is one of the most commonly used artificial sweeteners. When aspartame-sweetened Diet Coke was released in 1982 it make aspartame more popular. Today, at least in the United States, when the word "diet" is seen or heard it is assumed to be aspartame.

The first artificial sweeteners used in diet soda were cyclamates (often synergistically with saccharin). While many say these cyclamate-sweetened soda had a better taste than the diet soda that came after them, in 1970 the Food and Drug Administration banned cyclamates in the United States because there was proof that they caused cancer in lab rats. Cyclamates are still used in many countries around the world, including for diet soda.

Once cyclamates were banned, American producers turned to saccharin. Saccharin alone was often criticized for having a bitter taste and "chemical" aftertaste. Some manufacturers, such as Coca-Cola with Tab, attempted to rectify this by adding a small amount of sugar. In 1977, the FDA was petitioned to ban saccharin, too, as a carcinogen, but a moratorium was placed on the ban until studies were conducted. The ban was lifted in 1991, but by that time, virtually all diet soda production had shifted to using aspartame. Perhaps the most notable holdout is Tab, which nevertheless also uses some aspartame in its formula.

Recently two other sweeteners, sucralose (marketed as Splenda) and acesulfame potassium ("Sunett" or "Ace K" (the K is the chemical symbol for potassium) which is usually used in conjunction with aspartame, sucralose, or saccharin rather than alone) have come into growing use, particularly by smaller beverage producers (e.g. Big Red). Diet Rite is the non-aspartame diet soda brand with the highest sales today; it uses a combination of sucralose and acesulfame potassium.

Advocates say drinks employing these sweeteners have a more natural sugar-like taste than those made just with aspartame, and do not have a strong aftertaste. The newer aspartame-free drinks can also be safely consumed by phenylketonurics, because they do not contain phenylalanine. Critics say the taste is not better, merely different, or note that the long-term health risks of all or certain artificial sweeteners is unclear.

The widespread, though not universal, agreement that the newest formulations taste much more "normal" (sugar-like) than the older diet sodas have prompted some producers, such as Jones Soda, to abandon the "diet" label entirely in favor of "sugar-free soda," implying that the taste is good enough to drink the soda even when not trying to lose weight. (This idea was first floated by Diet Coke in 1984, with the tagline, "Just For the Taste of It.")

In 2005, the Coca-Cola Company announced it would produce a new formulation of Diet Coke sweetened with sucralose, to be called Diet Coke with Splenda, but it would continue to produce the aspartame version as well. There were also rumors that a sugar-free version of Coca-Cola Classic, also sweetened with sucralose, was being formulated as well. This formulation was eventually called Coca-Cola Zero, though it is sweetened with aspartame in conjunction with acesulfame potassium.

The beginning of the diet soda or refreshment era was in 1952, when Kirsch Bottling in Brooklyn, New York launched a sugar free ginger ale called No-Cal. It was designed for diabetics, not dieters, and distribution remained local. Royal Crown Cola placed an announcement in an Atlanta newspaper in 1958 announcing a diet soda product, Diet Rite. In 1962, Dr Pepper released a diet(etic) version of its soda, although it sold slowly due to the misconception that it was meant solely for diabetic consumption. In 1963, the Coca-Cola Company joined the diet soda market with Tab, which proved to be a huge success. Tab was originally sweetened with cyclamates and saccharin.

Tab, Diet Rite, and Fresca (a grapefruit-flavored soda introduced by Coca-Cola) were the only brand-name diet refreshments on the market until Pepsi released Diet Pepsi in the 1960s (initially as Patio Diet Cola). Diet 7 Up was also released in 1963 under the name Like. It was discontinued in 1969 due to the US government ban of cyclamate sweetener. After reformulation, it was reintroduced as Diet 7 Up in 1970. It was renamed Sugar Free 7 Up in 1973 then back to Diet 7 Up in 1979. Coca-Cola countered by releasing Diet Coke in 1982. After the release of Diet Coke, Tab took a backseat on the Coca-Cola production lines; Diet Coke could be more easily identified by consumers as associated with Coca-Cola than Tab. Additionally, a study was released claiming that saccharin was a possible carcinogen, leading to Coca-Cola's decision to decrease production of Tab. Prompted by the rising popularity of soft drinks, in the mid-1980s some of those in the alcohol industry began to follow their lead with some beer companies putting sugar-free beer on the market.

By the early 1990s, a wide array of different companies had their own diet refreshments on supermarket shelves. Tab made a comeback during the late 1990s, after new studies demonstrated that saccharin is not an important factor in the risk of cancer. Nevertheless, the Coca-Cola Company has maintained its 1984 reformulation, replacing some of the saccharin in Tab with NutraSweet.

By 2002, some soda companies had diversified to include such flavors as vanilla and lemon among their products, and diet sodas were soon being produced with those flavors as well (see Diet Vanilla Coke, Diet Pepsi Vanilla). By 2004, several alcohol companies had released sugar-free or "diet" alcoholic products too.

Along with possible health concerns of sugar substitutes and caffeine overuse, the effectiveness of diet soda as a weight loss tool should also be considered.

Changing the food energy intake from one food will not necessarily change a person's overall food energy intake, or cause a person to lose weight. One study, at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, reported by Sharon Fowler at the ADA annual meeting, actually suggested the opposite, where consumption of diet soda was correlated with weight gain. While Fowler did suggest that the undelivered expected calories from diet soda may stimulate the appetite, the correlation does not prove that consumption of diet soda caused the weight gain. The ADA has yet to issue an updated policy concerning diet soda.

An independent study by researchers with the Framingham Heart Study in Massachusetts, has turned up results which indicate that the consumption of diet soda correlates with increased metabolic syndrome. Of the 9,000 males and females studied, findings stated that 48% of the subjects were at higher risk for weight gain and elevated blood sugar. The researchers also acknowledged that diet soda drinkers were less likely to consume healthy foods, and that drinking diet soda flavored with artificial sweeteners more than likely increases cravings for sugar flavored sweets.

A preliminary abstract presented by the University of Miami's Hannah Gardener linked daily consumption of diet soda to a 61% higher incidence of "vascular events" such as strokes and heart attacks, although Gardener acknowledged that these results could not be conclusively linked to harmful effects of diet soda itself, and may be the result of other behaviors. The author stated confirmation was required prior to drawing conclusions. These studies were published as abstracts and presented at a conference. These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal

Among individuals who drink several regular sodas per day, diet soda may be a better choice, according to a website on dieting. Studies have also indicated that body mass gain is an unlikely consequence of artificial sweetener consumption.

Animal studies suggest that artificial sweeteners cause body weight gain, theoretically because of a faulty insulin response, at least in cattle and rats. Rats given sweeteners have steadily increased caloric intake, increased body weight, and increased adiposity (fatness). Adding saccharin to the food of calves increases their body weight as well.

In some countries outside the United States and Canada, the term "light" is often used instead of "diet".

In an effort to cash in on the surging popularity of low-carbohydrate diets, in 2004 both Coca-Cola and Pepsico released reduced-calorie versions of their flagship sodas that contain approximately half the sugar of the regular version. The Pepsi variant, Pepsi Edge, is sweetened with sucralose and corn syrup. The sweetening of the Coca-Cola variant, Coca-Cola C2, is a combination of corn syrup, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose. Pepsi discontinued Edge in 2005, citing lackluster sales. Coca-Cola soon followed suit.

Half the sugar of a can of regular cola is still more sugar than many people on popular low-carbohydrate diets are permitted to have in a day. It is possible that these sodas are targeted, instead, at so-called "carb-conscious consumers" who are paying attention to, but not trying to drastically reduce, their carbohydrate intake.

<doc id="299199" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299199" title="Zulu language">
Zulu language

Zulu () is the language of the Zulu people. 10 million people speak Zulu, and most of them (95%) live in South Africa. It is the most common home language in South Africa, where 24% of people speak it at home. Over 50% of the population also speak and understand the language.

In 1994, it became one of South Africa's 11 official languages. Like other Bantu languages, Zulu is written using the Latin alphabet.

Zulu belongs to the Nguni group of Bantu languages. Zulu migrants (people who move from place to place) have taken the language to other regions. There are now Zulu speakers in Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Mozambique, Malawi, and Swaziland. 

Zulu speakers in Zimbabwe speak a dialect called "Northern Ndebele language."

People who speak Xhosa can understand most Zulu. The opposite is also true: Zulu speakers can understand Xhosa. Xhosa language is the most common language spoken in the Eastern Cape of South Africa.

The Zulu, Xhosa, and other Nguni people have lived in South Africa for a long time. The Zulu language has a lot of click sounds common in Southern African languages. These click sounds are not found in the rest of Africa. The Nguni people have lived together with other Southern tribes like the San and Khoi. 

Zulu and all other native Southern African languages was at first an oral language. It was not written down until missionaries came from Europe. These missionaries used the Latin alphabet to write the Zulu language. The first Zulu grammar book was published in Norway in 1850 by Hans Paludan Smith Schreuder.

The oldest document written in Zulu is a Bible from 1883. John Dube, a Zulu from Natal, wrote the first Zulu novel, "Insila kaShaka", in 1933. Another important Zulu author was Reginald Dhlomo. Dhlomo wrote "U-Dingane" (1936), "U-Shaka" (1937), "U-Mpande" (1938), "U-Cetshwayo" (1952) and "U-Dinizulu" (1968). Other important Zulu writers are Benedict Wallet Vilakazi and Oswald Mbuyiseni Mtshali.

Before 1994, the Zulu language was controlled by the Zulu Language Board in KwaZulu-Natal. Today the Pan South African Language Board supports the use of all 11 official languages of South Africa.

Before 1994, the official languages of South Africa were English, Dutch, and Afrikaans. During Apartheid, Zulu was spoken commonly in the Kwazulu bantustan. All education, however, at the high school level was in English or Afrikaans.

After Apartheid ended in 1994, Zulu became one of the official languages in South Africa. The SABC first started showing Zulu-language television and news programs in the 1980s. There are many Zulu radio stations and newspapers available, mostly in the Kwazulu-Natal province and Johannesburg. The first full-length feature film in Zulu was "Yesterday". It was made in 2004 and nominated for an Academy Award (Oscar).

In "The Lion King" movie, the "Circle of Life" song has many Zulu phrases in it. Some of these phrases are:
Other "Lion King" songs also had Zulu phrases in them.

There are two main types of Zulu. One type is called standard Zulu, and it is taught in schools. Standard Zulu is also called "deep Zulu" (). Standard Zulu is a purist language. This means that new ideas are described using words that are derived from other Zulu words.

The other type of Zulu is called urban Zulu (). Urban Zulu is the kind of Zulu spoken by people who live in cities. Urban Zulu uses loan words borrowed from other languages to describe new ideas. Most of these loan words come from English.

Some of these different words for new ideas in Standard and Urban Zulu are listed here:

These two different types of Zulu language make problems in learning and education. Young people speak urban Zulu and do not often understand standard Zulu.

This is a list of phrases in Zulu.

Zulu place names occur in the "locative" form most of the time. A place name is both a preposition and a name. Changing the prefix of the place name changes the preposition.

For example, the Zulu name for Johannesburg is "iGoli." The word "eGoli" means to/at/in/from Johannesburg. The root word "Goli" means "Johannesburg," but doesn't mean anything by itself in Zulu.

Most of the time, changing the "i-" or "u-" prefix to the "e-" prefix changes the meaning like this. In some cases, like with Durban, the name changes too.

The Zulu name for the language is "isiZulu". The "isi-" prefix means "language." (It also means other things, but here it means language.) For example, "isiNgisi" means English, "isiXhosa" means Xhosa, "isiBhunu" means Afrikaans, and "isiJalimane" means German.

When the word Zulu has a prefix that is "not" "isi-", it means a lot of different things. This is a table that shows how the meanings of the word changes:

Some people like to call Zulu "isiZulu" in English. This is like calling Spanish "Español" or Polish "Polski" when talking in English.

Zulu people

The Zulu () are the largest ethnic group in South Africa. There are 10-11 million Zulu living in South Africa, mostly in KwaZulu-Natal province. A small number of Zulu also live in Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Mozambique. The Zulu language, called , is a Bantu language of the Nguni subgroup.

The Zulu Kingdom was very important in South African history during the 1800s and 1900s. During Apartheid, the Zulu people were third-class citizens and suffered from official discrimination. Today the Zulu people are the largest ethnic group in South Africa and have equal rights.

The Zulu were originally a major clan in the area that is today Northern KwaZulu-Natal. The Zulu clan was started around the year 1709 by Zulu kaNtombhela. In the Nguni languages, the words "iZulu", "iliZulu", and "liTulu" mean "heaven", or "sky." 

In the early 1700s, many large Nguni communities and clans lived in the area. These groups were called "isizwe" (nations) and "isibongo" (clans). These Nguni communities had migrated down the East coast of Africa over thousands of years. These movements of people were called the Bantu migrations. They probably arrived in what is today South Africa in the 800s.

Gordon Bennett Cup (auto racing)

The Gordon Bennett Cup for auto racing was set up by James Gordon Bennett, Jr.. He was the millionaire owner of the "New York Herald". The award was first given in 1900 in France. It was an car-racing event between teams from different countries.

In 1900, the Automobile Club de France (ACF) was given the trophy ("prize"). The trophy could be won in a race between automobile clubs from different countries. The trophy was given out every year until 1905. After that, the ACF held the first Grand Prix motor racing event at the Circuit de la Sarthe, in Le Mans.

The British Racing Green was first used in the 1903 Gordon Bennet Cup in Ireland.

The Gordon Bennett Cup auto races included racing drivers from across Europe. There were also drivers from the United States like Alexander Winton, who drove his Winton automobile. 

The rules were that the races were done in the country of the winner of the year before. The races were between national teams. Because of this, the national racing colours had to be set for each country. Great Britain had to choose a different colour to red, white or blue (the colours of the flag) because they had been taken by Italy, Germany and France. They choose shamrock green because the race that year was run in Ireland. This became known as the British racing green.

Jhulelal

Jhulelal (Sindhi:جهوللال), Kutchi: ઝૂલેલાલ) is the "Ishta Dev" (community God) of Sindhi people. His birthday "Cheti Chand" which falls on the second day of the Chaitra month is auspicious for Sindhis and is celebrated all over the world with traditional pomp and gaiety.

The legend of Jhulelal is closely related to religious persecution and the oneness of God. Muslim invaders from Turkey and Persia expanded their empires eastward and conquered Sindh (and later, a large part of the Indian subcontinent). Legend has it that Jhulelal convinced a tyrannical Muslim ruler, Mirkshah, to treat Hindus and Muslims equally. He also impressed upon the ruler the fact that although Hindus called their God "Ishwar" and Muslims refer to God as "Allah", they are the same one God who created the world. Jhulelal is revered by both Hindus and Muslims, who refer to him by several names including Lal Sai, Uderolal, Varun Dev, Doolhalal, Dariyalal and Zinda Pir.

Faith has established Jhulelal as the Asht Dev (community God) of Sindhis. His Birthday "Cheti Chand" second tithi of Chaitra auspicious for Sindhis and is celebrated the world over with traditional pomp and gaiety. 

The Hindu legend of Jhulelal or the River Deity has its historical or semi-historical beginnings in Sind, an erstwhile province of united India and now a state of Pakistan. During the days of Sapt-Sindhu (land of seven rivers), the mainstream Sindhu and its tributaries were considered life-givers to the people who lived on its banks and drew sustenance from its waters. It was precisely the lure of plentiful water that brought invading hordes of Muslim rulers from the neighbouring Arabian Kingdoms to Sind and India. Having conquered Sind and its adjoining territories, they (Muslims) did not spread Islam at the point of the sword but with love and true knowledge. In the 10th century A.D. Sind came under the rule of Samras. The Samras being converts from Hinduism to Islam were neither bigots nor fanatics. However, there was no exception in the Sumra region. Being far away from its capital, Thatta maintained its separate identity and influence. Its rulers Mirkshah was not only a tyrant but also a religious fanatic. And as in the wont of many a tyrant, Mirkshah too was surrounded by sycophants. These friends advised him one day : "Spread Islam and you will be granted 'Janat' or eternal bliss after death."

Irish Independent

The Irish Independent is an Irish daily newspaper. It is published in both compact and broadsheet sizes. It is the main publication of Independent News and Media. It is also called "The Independent" or "Indo" for short.

The "Irish Independent" was formed in 1905. Before then, there was a paper called Daily Irish Independent. This was an 1890s pro-Parnellite newspaper. 

The Irish Independent was launched by William Martin Murphy. He was a controversial Irish nationalist businessman. He was against Charles Stewart Parnell. 

During the 1913 Lockout of workers, Murphy was the leader among the employers. His paper, "Irish Independent", published news reports and opinion pieces that were against the workers who were on strike. It wrote that the union's would lose that fight. 

The "Irish Independent" said about the 1916 Easter Rising that it was ""insane and criminal"". It famously called for the shooting of its leaders. 

In December 1919, during the Irish War of Independence, a group of twenty IRA men destroyed the printing works of the paper. They did this because the paper was not writing good things about the Irish Republican Army. They said the paper was pro-British and had a Unionist stance. 

In 1924, the traditional nationalist newspaper, the "Freeman's Journal", merged with the "Irish Independent".

In the 1970s, it was taken over by former Heinz chairman Tony O'Reilly.

Charles Felix of Sardinia

Charles Felix (Carlo Felice Giuseppe Maria; 6 April 1765 – 27 April 1831) was born a Prince of Savoy and was later the last mainline Savoyard monarch of Sardinia. He was a nephew of Charles III of Spain and cousin of Maria I of Portugal as well as son in law of Maria Carolina of Austria. He was King of Sardinia from 1821 to 1831.

"Carlo Felice" was born in Turin as the eleventh child and fifth son born to Victor Amadeus III and Maria Antonia of Spain. From birth he was titled as the Duke of Genoa and the Marquis of Susa from 1796. He was a younger brother of Charles Emmanuel IV and Victor Emmanuel I. He spent his childhood with his sister Maria Carolina, the Count of Moriana, living at the Castle of Moncalieri. He had a very closed character. 

He was married by proxy to Princess Maria Cristina of Naples and Sicily on 7 March 1807. She was a daughter of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Maria Carolina of Austria, sister of "Marie Antoinette". 

He was not expected to ever succeed to the throne. However Charles Emmanuel never had any children and abdicated the throne on June 4, 1802. Victor Emmanuel I had four living daughters when he abdicated the throne in 1821. As the succession was regulated by the Salic Law, Charles Felix succeeded his brother on the throne. He and his wife died without issue after a reign of ten years. He was succeeded by the senior male of his House as Charles Albert of Savoy after he died in Turin at the Palazzo Chablais which had been given to him by his sister Princess Maria Anna.

The Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa was named after him as well as the main road of the island of Sardinia, the Strada statale 131 Charles Felix, that connects the towns of Cagliari and Sassari-Porto Torres, realised in 19th century, is entitled to him.

Madison Avenue

Madison Avenue is a north-south avenue in the borough of Manhattan in New York City (U.S.) which carries northbound one-way traffic. It runs from Madison Square (at 23rd Street) to the Madison Avenue Bridge, at 138th Street. In doing so, it passes through Midtown Manhattan, the Upper East Side (including Carnegie Hill), Spanish Harlem, and Harlem. It is named after Madison Square, which is itself named after James Madison, the fourth President of the United States. Since the 1920s, the street's name has been synonymous with the American advertising industry.

Madison Avenue was not part of the original New York City street grid established in the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, and was carved between Park Avenue (formerly Fourth) and Fifth Avenue in 1836, due to the effort of lawyer and real estate developer Samuel B. Ruggles. Ruggles was a graduate of Yale University who had previously purchased and developed New York's Gramercy Park in 1831, who was in part responsible for the development of Union Square and who also named Lexington Avenue.

Madison Avenue carries one-way traffic uptown (northbound) from 23rd Street to 135th Street, with the change from two-way traffic having taken place on January 14, 1966, at which time Fifth Avenue was changed to one way downtown (southbound).

The term "Madison Avenue" is often used to mean "advertising". Madison Avenue became identified with the advertising industry after the quick growth along the avenue during the 1920s.

According to "The Emergence of Advertising in America", by the year 1861 there were twenty advertising agencies in New York City. In 1911, the New York City Association of Advertising Agencies was founded, as years ahead of the establishment of the American Association of Advertising Agencies.

Among various depictions in popular culture, the portion of the advertising industry which centers on Madison Avenue serves as a backdrop for the AMC television drama "Mad Men", which focuses on industry activities during the 1960s.

In recent decades, many agencies have left Madison Avenue, with some moving further downtown and others moving west. Today, only a few agencies are still located in the old business cluster on Madison Avenue, including Young & Rubicam, StrawberryFrog, TBWA Worldwide and Doyle Dane Bernbach. However, the term is still used to describe the agency business as a whole and the large, New York–based agencies in particular.

Madison Avenue has a partial lane of the avenue which is limited to turns made by city buses or taxicabs, at some hours of the day. Based on Section 4-12(m) of the New York City Traffic Rules, driving a vehicle, other than a bus, is prohibited in the bus lane on Madison Avenue to turn right during the restricted hours specified by sign between 42nd Street and 59th Street. All vehicles are allowed at 60th Street, but a taxicab carrying a passenger may use the bus lane to turn right at 46th Street.

Maria Luisa of Parma

Maria Luisa of Parma (9 December 1751 - 2 January 1819) was Queen consort of Spain from 1788 to 1808 as the wife of King Charles IV of Spain. She was the youngest daughter of Duke Philip of Parma and his wife, Louise Élisabeth of France, the eldest daughter of King Louis XV. 

Christened Luisa Maria Teresa Anna, but known as María Luisa was born at the Ducal Palace of Colorno in the Duchy of Parma. She was the favourite child of her mother, who tried to engage her to the heir to the French throne, however the prince died in 1761. In 1762 Maria Luisa became engaged to the Prince of Asturias (heir to the throne), Charles, later King Charles IV of Spain. She married the future Charles IV on 4 September 1765. From her marriage she was the most senior female at the Spanish court, Queen Maria Amalia having died in 1761. 

Maria Luisa was regularly painted by the famous Spanish artist Goya. She was often described by contemporaries as an ugly, vicious, and coarse woman who greatly dominated the king. Maria Luisa dominated her husband and was believed to have had many love affairs, but there is no evidence that Maria Luisa had any lovers. Gossip pointed out Manuel de Godoy, her husband's Prime Minister, was her long-time lover. She was unpopular during her reign and has also long had a bad reputation in history, mainly because of her alleged love affairs and her support of pro-French policies that eventually weren't good for Spain. In 1792, the "Order of Queen Maria Luisa" was founded on her suggestion, an order which was given only to women.

Her husband abdicated the throne of Spain in 1808, and together with Maria Luisa and Godoy spent the rest of his life in exile. When Napoleon's army invaded the country, several pamphlets blamed her for that. Maria Luisa spent some years in France and then in Rome, Italy. Both Maria Luisa and her husband died in Italy in early 1819.

Icknield Street

Icknield Street or Ryknild Street is a Roman road in Britain that runs from the Fosse Way at Bourton on the Water in Gloucestershire to Templeborough in South Yorkshire. It passes through Alcester, Birmingham, Lichfield and Derby.

Four Roman roads are named in the Laws of Edward the Confessor; Watling Street, Ermine Street, the Fosse Way and Hikenild (or Icknield) Street. Hikenild Street, is generally supposed to be connected with the Iceni. Various forms of the name, the earliest, in Anglo-Saxon, are Icenhilde Weg or Icenilde We. These roads are from the borders of Norfolk through Cambridgeshire, Bucks, Berks, Hants, and Wilts into Dorset. These locations however would identify the path as Icknield Way, an Iron Age trackway running from Norfolk to Dorset. 

This road got the name Ryknild Street during the 12th century when it was named by Ranulf Higdon, a monk writing in 1344 in his "Polychronicon". Higdon, gives the name of the fourth road as Rikenild Strete, which, he says, tends from the south-west to the north, and begins at St. David's and continues to the mouth of the Tyne, passing Worcester, Droitwich, Birmingham, Lichfield, Derby, and Chesterfield. It has borne that name, or Rigning, Reenald, or Rignall, from early times. In three of the four MSS. of Higdon, the name is given Rikenilde, Rikenyldes, and in the fourth, which is said to be one of the earliest, Hikenil Street. Trevisa's English translation (1387) calls it Rykeneldes Street. Harverfield writing in the Victoria County History of Warwickshire doubted if the road had any real and original right to either name, preferring Ryknild as no less correct, (or no more wrong) and being able to separate it from Icknield Street in Oxfordshire and Berkshire. It is now called Icknield or Ryknild Street to separate it from the older Icknield Way. A kept part of the Roman road can be seen at Sutton Park in Birmingham.

Francis Octavius Grenfell

Francis Octavius Grenfell, VC (4 September 1880 - 24 May 1915) was an English soldier of British Army. He received the Victoria Cross. The cross is the highest award for bravery against the enemy, and can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Grenfell was born on 4 September 1880. His parents were Sophia and Pascoe Du Pré Grenfell. He was one of fifteen children. He had a twin brother, Riversdale Grenfell. He was also in the 9th Lancers and killed in action in September 1914. Admiral John Pascoe Grenfell was their grandfather. Field Marshal Francis Grenfell, 1st Baron Grenfell was their uncle. An older brother, Lieutenant Robert Septimus Grenfell, 21st Lancers, was killed in a cavalry charge during the Battle of Omdurman in 1898. Three other brothers, Cecil Grenfell, Howard Maxwell Grenfell and Arthur Morton Grenfell all reached the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the British Army. A cousin, Lieutenant Claude George Grenfell was killed at Spion Kop during the Boer War. Two other cousins Julian Grenfell (the poet) and his brother Gerald William Grenfell were killed in the First World War.

Grenfell was a representative cricket player at Eton collage. He joined the army in 1900 and first served in the Second Boer War in the King's Royal Rifle Corps.

Later, he served in First World War in the 9th Lancers, British Army. He was 33 years old and a Captain, when he was awarded the VC for the following brave deed.

On 24 August 1914 at Audregnies, Belgium, Captain Grenfell rode with the regiment in a charge against a large body of unbroken German infantry. Damages of friendly army were so heavy, and Grenfell was left as the senior officer. When he was reorganizing the regiment behind a railway bank, he was twice hit and severely wounded. But once he was asked to save the guns by Major Ernest Wright Alexander of the 119th Battery, Royal Field Artillery, Grenfell and some volunteers helped to push the guns out of range of enemy fire, under a shower of bullets.
London Gazette on 16 September 1914 wrote as follows:
He was killed in action on 24 May 1915 and is buried in the Vlamertinghe Military Cemetery.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Regimental Museum of the 9th/12th Royal Lancers housed in Derby Museum and Art Gallery, Derby, England.

All nine of the Grenfell brothers were expert polo players. Francis and his brother Riversdale Grenfell were regarded as the best in the family. Francis was rated at an 8 goal handicap. The twin brothers were on the Ranelagh team that won the American Open. And they were on the team Freebooters, alongside Leopold Christian Duncan Jenner and the Duke of Roxburghe, that won the Hurlingham Champion Cup.

KwaZulu-Natal

KwaZulu-Natal (, also called KZN or Natal) is a province of South Africa. Before 1994, KwaZulu-Natal was made up of the province of Natal and the KwaZulu homeland.

In the 1830s, the northern part of KwaZulu-Natal was part of the Zulu Kingdom. The southern part of KwaZulu-Natal was a Boer republic called Natalia (1839-1843). In 1843, Natalia became a British colony. Zululand () remained independent until 1879. 

Today KwaZulu Natal is the home of the Zulu nation. It is called the "garden province." Two natural areas, the iSimangaliso Wetland Park and the uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park, have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

KwaZulu-Natal is located in the southeast of South Africa. It borders three other provinces, the Indian Ocean, and the countries of Mozambique, Swaziland, and Lesotho. Its capital is Pietermaritzburg and its largest city is Durban.

KwaZulu-Natal is about in area, making it about the same size as Portugal. The province has three different geographic areas. The lowland region lies along the Indian Ocean coast. It is very narrow in the south and widens in the northern part of the province. The central region is called the Natal Midlands. The midlands are hilly plateaus that rise toward the west. 

The third region is mountainous. The two mountain ranges are the Drakensberg Mountains in the west and the Lebombo Mountains in the north. The Drakensberg mountains are basalt cliffs that rise near Lesotho. The Lebombo Mountains are ancient granite mountains that run south from Swaziland. The Tugela River flows west to east across the center of the province and is the region's largest river.

The coastal areas have dense stands of subtropical trees and shrubs and deep ravines. Afromontane Forest grows on the steep sides of the ravines. The midlands have moist (wet) grasslands and small pockets of Afromontane Forest. The north is mostly wet savanna. The Drakensberg region is alpine grassland.

One of the biggest problems in the province is HIV infection. The country of South Africa has more HIV-positive citizens than any other country in the world. KwaZulu-Natal has the highest rate of HIV infection of all of the provinces. According to UNAIDS in 2009, the infection rate is 39%.

Many people die from complications from AIDS. Infected people in KwaZulu-Natal do not have the health care, medicine, and proper food they need to stay healthy. HIV/AIDS has slowed economic growth by destroying human capital, the ability of people to make money in society.

The Herero language (Herero: "Otjiherero") is a Bantu language of the the Niger-Congo group. It is spoken by the Herero people in Namibia and Botswana. There are about 237,000 Herero speakers in both countries, 206,000 in Namibia and the rest in Botswana. 

The language is spoken in an area called "Hereroland". This area includes the regions of Omaheke, Otjozondjupa, and Kunene. The Himba people, who are related to the Herero people, speak a dialect that is very close to Herero. A large minority of people in Windhoek (the capital of Namibia) speak Herero.

The Herero language is written in the Latin alphabet. The first written work in Herero was a translation of the Bible by missionary Gottlieb Viehe (1839-1901). Father Peter Heinrich Brincker (1836-1904), another missionary, translated several religious works and songs into Herero.

Herero is taught in Namibian schools and at the University of Namibia. It is one of the six minority languages used in broadcasts by the Namibian State Radio (NBC). Gamsberg Macmillan, , has published the only dictionary in Herero.

K-pop

K-Pop or Korean pop or Korean popular music, is a musical genre using a mix of electronic, hip hop, pop, rock, and R&B music. It began in South Korea. As well as music, K-pop has grown into a popular subculture among teenagers and young adults throughout Asia. There is a lot of interest in the fashions and styles of Korean idol groups and singers.

K-pop can now reach a much larger audience through use of the Internet. With Facebook fan pages, iTunes, Twitter, and music videos on YouTube, K-pop is becoming popular in many other countries around the world.

The setting up of Seo Tai-ji & Boys in 1992 was a turning point for popular music in South Korea. Using rap rock and techno styles, Hip hop duos such as Deux also were popular in the early 1990s.
In 1995, Korean businessman Lee Soo Man opened South Korea's largest talent agency, S.M. Entertainment and set up the first K-Pop girl groups and boy bands. By the late 1990s, new agencies like YG Entertainment, DSP Entertainment, and JYP Entertainment were producing talent as quickly as possible.

Groups such as as , H.O.T, Sechs Kies, god and Shinhwa, and artists like Drunken Tiger had huge success in the 1990s. 

The talent agencies train new artists and bands for the K-pop industry. To make sure it is successful they take over every part of the young person's career. They can spend more than $400,000 to train and launch a new artist. Through this practice of apprenticeship, which often lasts two years or more, trainees are taught to sing, learn professional choreography, sculpt and shape their bodies through exercise, and study multiple languages, all the while attending school. In order to get this money back, the artists are signed up to long contracts, and with little money being paid. These have been described as slave contracts. The band Dong Bang Shin Ki were given a 13 year contract which the Korean courts have said was too long and had too many restrictions. With CD sales being low, and Internet sales making only a few cents from a song, most money is made through tours and selling merchandise. 

K-Pop is becoming popular outside of Asia, most notably in the United States, Canada, and Australia. In 2009, the Wonder Girls became the first Korean singers on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart with their single, "Nobody". The following year, solo artist Taeyang and 2ne1 also reached the top of various music charts throughout the United States and Canada with albums and hit songs. In 2011, Big Bang's album "Tonight" became the first K-pop album to reach the top 10 on US iTunes chart. It was also only non-English language album in the top 100. 
To make the genre popular around the world, K-pop artists are starting to work with talent outside of Korea. In the United States, Korean artists are touring with groups such as the Jonas Brothers. They are also working with well-known producers including Kanye West, Teddy Riley, Diplo, Rodney Jerkins, and will.i.am.

Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan

Hell's Kitchen, also known as Clinton and Midtown West, is a neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City (U.S.). It covers the area on the West Side, between 34th Street and 59th Street, from 8th Avenue to the Hudson River.

The neighborhood provides transportation, hospital and warehouse infrastructure support to the Midtown Manhattan business district. Its gritty reputation held back real estate prices in the area, compared to much of the rest of Manhattan, until the early 1990s.

The rough and tumble days on the West Side figure heavily in Damon Runyon's stories and the childhood home of Marvel Comics' Daredevil. Various Manhattan ethnic conflicts formed the basis of the 1957 musical and 1961 film "West Side Story".

Once a center of poor and working-class Irish Americans, over the last three decades of the 20th century and into the new millennium, Hell's Kitchen has undergone change as a result of its location at Midtown. The 1969 edition of the "Plan for New York City" book, authored by the City Planning Commission, stated that people of modest means were being driven from the area by development pressures due to the Midtown location. Today, many actors live in the neighborhood due to its closeness to the Broadway theaters and Actors Studio training school.

"Hell's Kitchen" generally refers to the area from 34th to 59th streets, southwest of Central Park. Starting west of 8th Avenue, city zoning regulations limit buildings to 6 stories high (although exceptions are often made). As a result, most of the buildings are older, often walk-ups. For the most part the neighborhood covers the ZIP codes 10019 and 10036. The post office for 10019 is known as Radio City Station, the original name for Rockefeller Center on Sixth Avenue.

Several different explanations exist for the original name. An early use of the phrase appears in a comment Davy Crockett made about another notorious Irish slum in Manhattan, Five Points. According to the Irish Cultural Society of the Garden City Area:
According to an article by Kirkley Greenwell, published online by the Hell's Kitchen Neighborhood Association:

Local historian Mary Clark adds a story when she states the name:
Today, most residents of the area, and most New Yorkers in general, refer to the area as "Hell's Kitchen", with "Clinton" being the name favored by the municipality, "gentrifiers", and eager real estate agents.

Northern Ndebele language

Northern Ndebele (, commonly called ) is an African language. It is categorized as part of the Nguni group
of Bantu languages. It is spoken by the Ndebele and Matabele people of Zimbabwe.

Sindebele is related to the Zulu language spoken in South Africa. The Ndebele people of Zimbabwe are descended from followers of the Zulu leader Mzilikazi. Mzilikazi and his people left kwaZulu in the early 1800s during the Mfecane.

The Northern Ndebele language and the Southern Ndebele language are "not" two variations of the same language. Both are Bantu languages, but Northern Ndebele is pretty much a dialect of Zulu. The Southern Ndebele language is much older and seems to be the first Nguni language to reach Southern Africa.

It is relatively easy to pronounce Ndebele words because the vowel sounds are constant. (That is, each vowel has basically one sound.) The accent is usually on the second-to-last syllable.

The vowels are "a", "e", "i", "o", and "u". They are pronounced like so:

In Ndebele there are three click sounds. They are shown with the letters c, q and x.

c is made by placing the tip of the tongue against the front upper teeth and gums, the centre of the tongue is pressed down and the tip of the tongue is moved backwards. The resulting sound is like the sound used in English to express annoyance, called a "clucking sound." Some words with this sound are (end), and (ask)

The q sound is made by raising the back of the tongue to touch the soft palate and touching the gums with the sides and tip of the tongue. The centre of the tongue is pressed down and the tip moved quickly away from the gum. The resulting sound is like the "pop" heard when quickly removing a cork from a bottle. Some words with this sound are (start) and (finish).

The x sound is made by placing the tongue so that the back of the tongue touches the soft palate and the sides and tip of the tongue touch the gums. One side of the tongue is quickly pulled away from the gums. Some words with this sound are (discuss) and (frog).

<doc id="299528" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299528" title="Diet (nutrition)">
Diet (nutrition)

In nutrition, diet is the sum of food that eats a person or another organism. Dietary habits are the usual decisions someone or a culture makes when choosing what foods to eat. With the word diet, it is often expressed the use of specific intake of nutrition for health or weight-management reasons (with the two often being related). Although humans are omnivores, each culture and each person holds some food preferences or some food taboos, due to personal tastes or ethical reasons. Individual dietary choices may be more or less healthful. A proper nutrition requires a proper ingestion and, also important, the absorption of vitamins, minerals, and food energy in the form of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Dietary habits and choices play a significant role in health and mortality, and can also define cultures and play a role in religion.

Diets are about eating the right quantity and type of food at the right time. When people talk about a diet, they are usually referring to a special kind of diet. When someone says they are "dieting", it means that they are trying to lose weight. People who study diet and eating habits are called dietitians.

When the diet is not right, people can gain or lose weight. They may become overweight or underweight. To get back to their normal weight, they need to change their diet. This may be very hard to do.

Some people have diseases where they cannot eat certain foods without becoming very sick. They need to change their diet to avoid these foods. A food allergy is a condition in which a specific food makes someone sick. Phenylketonuria is a disease in which a person cannot digest certain foods properly because they have an amino acid, or type of chemical, called phenylalanines in them.

<doc id="299531" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299531" title="Second Party System">
Second Party System

The Second Party System is a name for the political party system in the United States during the 1800s. It is a phrase used by historians and political scientists used to describe the time period between 1828 and 1854. People quickly became more interested in voted starting in 1828. More people came to political rallies and showed up to vote on election day. The number of partisan newspapers, which supported a certain political party, also went up. People became very loyal to their party. 

There were two main political parties during this time period. One was the Democratic Party, led by Andrew Jackson. The other was the Whig Party, started by Henry Clay. The Whig party was made up of members of the National Republican Party and other people who opposed Jackson.

There were also a number of important minor parties. The Anti-Masonic Party (1827-34) was important in developing political ideas and laws. The Liberty Party in the 1840s was an important abolitionist party (against slavery). The United States Free Soil Party in 1848 and 1852 was another anti-slavery party.

The Second Party System was an important part of the politics, society, economics, and culture of the Jacksonian Era. It was followed by the Third Party System after 1854. 

The phrase "second party system" was defined by the historian Richard P. McCormick. He said that the system was:

A number of important historical people were political leaders in this system. Some famous democrats were: Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, John C. Calhoun, James K. Polk, Lewis Cass, and Stephen Douglas. Some famous Whigs were: Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, William H. Seward, and Thurlow Weed.

The U.S. presidential election in 1824 did not have any political parties. There were four main candidates for presdient: Henry Clay, William Crawford, Andrew Jackson, and John Quincy Adams. At the end of the race, none of the candidates had enough votes in the electoral college to win, and the United States House of Representatives had to choose the winner. The three final candidates were Adams, Crawford, and Jackson. Even though Clay was not one of these finalists, he was the Speaker of the House, and it was his job to negotiate who would become president. Jackson had the most popular votes (votes cast by citizens) and the most electoral votes (votes cast by the electoral college), but was not elected. Instead, John Quincy Adams was elected president. He immediately chose Clay to be his Secretary of State.

Jackson loudly declared this to be a "corrupt bargain." Jackson was a very popular politician, the most famous fighter of the American Indian Wars, and a hero of the War of 1812. He gathered his supporters in politics and the local militias and created the Democratic Party. Martin Van Buren, a brilliant leader in New York politics, was Jackson's most important supporter. Van Buren was popular in Virginia and Pennsylvania, and he had the support of their electoral college votes. The new Democratic Party beat Adams in the U.S. presidential election of 1828 and Jackson was elected president. Van Buren became the Secretary of State, and later Vice President. Adams, Clay, and their supporters in the Democratic-Republican Party became known as the National Republicans.

Andrew Jackson opposed (was against) the idea of giving special favors to special interest groups. He strongly opposed the Second Bank of the United States. The Bank was a federal institution that worked somewhat like a central bank. (It was very similar to the Federal Reserve System that would be developed later.) The bank was controlled by the banker Nicholas Biddle and supported by Henry Clay. Jackson did not like any banks, and he did not believe in paper money. (He believed that money should only be gold and silver.) As president, he was able to close the Second Bank.

Jackson continued to attack the banking system. He issued his "Specie Circular" in July 1836. ("Specie" is a word that means gold and silver used as money.) The Circular said that only gold and siver coins, and not paper money, could be used to buy federal land. This made most businessmen and bankers join the Whig party. Also, cities that depended on commerce (trade) and industry became supporters of the Whig party. Jackson became more popular with subsistence farmers (farmers who grow crops to eat, but not to sell) and day laborers.

In US politics, the "Spoils System" was the practice of a political party giving its supporters positions in government. These government jobs were given as rewards and incentives (something that makes a person try harder) to keep working for the political party. 

Jackson used the spoils system a lot when he was president. He rewarded his supporters and promised future jobs if local and state politicians joined his team. He believed in the theory of rotation in office, where people would only remain in a position for a short time. He believed that this would keep the civil service from becoming corrupt. Other leaders of the Democratic Party wanted to give civil service jobs to friends and loyal party members. In total, Jackson dismissed less than twenty percent (20%) of the original civil service. 

As president, Jackson encouraged the use of the spoils system. It became an important part of the Second Party System and the Third Party System. The spoils system was ended in the 1890s.

Victoire of France

Victoire of France Princess of France (Victoire Louise Marie Thérèse; 11 May 1733 – 7 June 1799) was the fifth daughter of Louis XV of France and his wife Marie Leszczyńska. She died unmarried. 

Victoire, Daughter of France was born at the Palace of Versailles in 1733. As a daughter of the king of France she had the title of "daughter of France" which was highly prized within the royal family. She was the seventh child of ten. From birth she was known as "Madame Quatrième", as she was not baptised. She was however eventually named Victoire Louise Marie Thérèse, being known simply by her first name. Unlike the older children in the royal family, Victoire was raised at the Palace of Versailles but only till the age of five when she left Versailles to live at "Abbey of Fontevraud" in northern France. Leaving in 1738 with her sisters Sophie and Thérèse. The princesses left Versailles on 6 June 1738 accompanied by furniture and a military escort. 

At the age of 15, 1748, she was allowed to return to the royal court. Her religious education stayed with her all her life and she would always remain close to her siblings and mother. Victoire arrived to a court which was dominated by the powerful Madame de Pompadour who had become Louis XV's mistress in 1745. Victoire was often described as the most beautiful of the kings daughters. The only project for marriage arose in 1753 when it was suggested that she marry King Ferdinand VI of Spain as his wife was seriously ill at the time. However she recovered and there were never any other projects. 

In 1765, her older brother died of consumption at Fontainebleau at the age of 36. Victoire, like all of her sisters, mourned their brother greatly. As a result of his death, the future Louis XVI became the heir to the throne and the family was pushed closer together. Three years later, 1768, Versailles was again mourning, this time for the death of Queen Marie. The sadness within the royal family was worsened by the kings new passion for "Madame du Barry". The princesses redused to acknowledge the Barry and this caused friction within the court. However, at the death of Louis XV in 1774, Madame du Barry was exiled and Louis XVI came to the throne. Victoire and her sister Marie Adélaïde were close to the young king but did not like his wife "Marie Antoinette" purely because she was Austrian. 

Louis XV having died, Victoire and her sisters had to move out of their apartments and soon took up residence at the "Château de Bellevue" outside the capital. Victoire lived their with Marie Adélaïde and their younger sister Sophie and they redecorated the building to suit their tastes. Having no power at Versailles, the sisters began touring France at great expense which caused havoc for France's already bad finances. When Versailles was stormed, the sisters were at Bellevue and thus were not placed under house arrest. They quickly fled France and went to stay with their niece Marie Clotilde of France, (Turin) who was the wife of Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia. They then traveled to Rome in 1791 and soon ended up in Naples in 1796, home of Marie Antoinette's sister, the Queen of Naples. Moving to Corfu in 1799 followed by Trieste where Victoire eventually died of breast cancer. Marie Adélaïde died the following year in Rome. The two sisters were bought back to France during the reign of their nephew Louis XVIII and buried at the Basilica of Saint Denis.

Jamuna River

The Jamuna River (Bangla: যমুনা "Jomuna") is one of the three major rivers of Bangladesh. The river flows from India to Bangladesh and is a major channel of the Brahmaputra River. The Jamuna flows in the "southward direction" and meets the Padma River ("Pôdda") and Meghna River near Goalundo Ghat and Chandpur respectively. These waters then together flow into the Bay of Bengal.

The Jamuna is known to be a very wide river. The breadth of the river, from bank to bank, is about 2 miles in the dry season while its about 5 miles during the rainy season. The River also acts as an important resource for transportation.

Cornish dialect

Cornish Dialect (also called Anglo-Cornish Dialect) is the dialect of the English language spoken in Cornwall. 

A long time ago, people in Cornwall spoke the Cornish language. This is a language similar to Welsh and Breton. After a while, people speaking English came into Cornwall, and the Cornish people started to learn English. They didn't speak in exactly the same way as the people they learned English from, instead they spoke in a distinct way, the Cornish dialect of English. Eventually they forgot how to speak the original Cornish language by about the year 1800.

Cornish people also spoke Cornish dialect when they went abroad to America and Australia and other places. 

The Cornish dialect changes between the west and east of Cornwall. In the east, it is more like how people in Devon speak.

Sometimes Cornish people use different words to people who speak 'proper' English. They might also say the words in a different order when they speak Cornish dialect from when they speak 'proper' English, which is a difference in grammar between Cornish dialect and 'proper' English.. Other times, they say the same words in a different way using different vowel sounds from 'proper' English.

When Cornish people started to go to school in the late 19th century, teachers told them to speak 'proper' English not dialect. A lot of people thought that people who spoke the dialect were not as intelligent and educated as those who spoke 'proper' English, so people spoke the dialect less, and the dialect declined. In the 20th century, a lot of people moved into Cornwall from the south east part of England near London. These people did not speak the Cornish dialect and found it hard to understand Cornish people who spoke it. The Cornish people spoke the dialect less because they did not want people not to be able to understand them.

As fewer people spoke the Cornish dialect, other people, such as people in the Old Cornwall Society, wrote down the dialect, and made audio recordings, so the dialect wouldn't be lost.

People have written books, short stories, and poetry in Cornish Dialect.

Mumbai Indians

Mumbai Indians is one of the ten teams which plays in the Indian Premier League. The team was found in 2008 and is owned by Reliance Industries. Sachin Tendulkar is the current captain of the team while Robin Singh is the head coach. Assisting Robin in coaching are Jonty Rodhes (Fielding Coach) and Shaun Pollock (Bowling Coach).

Reliance Industries purchased the rights of MI ("Abbreviation of Mumbai Indians") for a total of "Rupees 441 Cr ($ 112.9 m)" during the auction on 24 January 2008. As the name suggests, the franchise represents the city of Mumbai.

MI lost their Team Captain & Icon Player, Sachin Tendulkar due to a Hamstring Injury. Harbhajan Singh replaced him as the captain of the side. Due to some issues, Shaun Pollock had to takeover which bought some stability into the side for the first time in the season. The Mumbai Indians finished with a total of 7 wins and 7 losses and thus missed out on a playoff spot by a few points.

Due to issues in India, the second edition of IPL ha to be held in South Africa. The second season also proved to be a setback for the team as they finished with a total of 5 Wins, 8 Loses and 1 No Result (Match got cancelled due to rain); and thus not making it to the playoffs again.

During the auction held for the 2010 IPL Season, Mumbai Indians purchased Kieron Pollard for $750,000. This proved to be a great boost for the team. After the group stages, Mumbai Indians won 10 out of their 14 matches thus qualifying them for the playoffs. In the semifinals against Royal Challengers Bangalore, Mumbai Indians emerged victorious by 35 runs. 

The Indians then faced Chennai Super Kings in the final of the 2010 Season; the match was held in "Navi Mumbai". MI lost the match by 22 runs thus finishing as the runner-ups. 

They completed the season with a total of 11 Wins and 5 loses and also got a spot in the Airtel Champions League T20

Mumbai Indians introduce two new players to their squad, Aiden Blizzard and James Franklin. Both these players perform well for the team in their debut season. Team Captain Sachin Tendulkar put up an impressive performance by scoring 513 runs in 10 matches and at the same time, team's senior bowler, Lasith Malinga took 28 wickets out of the 15 games. Impressive performance by MI in the group stages got them a place in the playoffs. Due to the addition of 2 more teams from this edition of Indian Premier League, the playoffs were a bit different. 

Mumbai Indians beat Kolkata Knight Riders in their eliminator by 4 wickets. MI went on to face Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Qualifier 2. "Mumbai Indians" lost to "Royal Challengers Bangalore" by 43 runs which ended the journey of Mumbai Indians in the 2011 Season. Defending Champions Chennai beat Bangalore in the finals thus getting the first spot. Royal Challengers Bangalore finished second while MI finished third.

Antler

Antlers are the usually large, branching structures on the heads of deer.

Only deer have antlers, on males. Only reindeer (caribou) have antlers on the females, and these are normally smaller than those of the males. 

While an antler is growing, it is covered with highly vascular skin called velvet, which supplies oxygen and nutrients to the growing bone. 

Antlers are one of the most striking cases of male secondary sex characteristics in the animal kingdom. They grow faster than any other mammal bones. Growth occurs at the tip, and is initially cartilage, which is mineralized to become bone. Once the antler has achieved its full size, the velvet is lost and the antler's bone dies. This dead bone structure is the mature antler. The antlers fall off at some point. 

To re-grow antlers each year uses up nutrition, so they are honest signals of food gathering capability.

The principle means of evolution of antlers is sexual selection, which operates by two mechanisms: Male–male competition (behaviorally, physiologically) and female mate choice. 

Male–male competition can take place in two forms. First, they can compete when males use their antlers as weapons to compete for mates; second, they can compete where males present their antlers to display their strength and fertility. Males with the largest antlers are more likely to obtain mates and achieve fertilization success.

A kitchen stove, cooking stove, cookstove, or cooker is a kitchen appliance designed for cooking food. Kitchen stoves rely on the application of direct heat for the cooking process and may also contain an oven, used for baking.

Modern gas stoves were developed already in the 1820s, but these remained isolated experiments. At the Great Exhibition in London in 1851, a gas stove was shown, but only in the 1880s did this technology start to become a commercial success. The main factor in this delay was the slow growth of the gas pipe network.

There are still many traditional stoves made, which burn wood or solid fuel. The look and feel may be very similar to many traditional stoves, but the way fuel is burnt has evolved. Many also have back boilers for domestic heating.

Joseph Whittaker (botanist)

Joseph Whittaker (1813 – 1894) was a British Botanist who visited South Australia in 1839. 300 plants in Kew Gardens are the collection which Whittaker made during that trip. And 2,200 pressed British plants in Derby Museum and Art Gallery are also Whittaker's.

Whittaker's exact birth date is not known. He was christened at Quarndon near Derby on 8 February 1813. His father was also named Joseph, and was a labourer who married to Sarah (born Clarke). The son is sometimes reported as being born in Breadsall in 1815.

In 1838 Whittaker went on a voyage to Austratia as "gardener". His new employer was Lt. Col. George Gawler who had recently been appointed as the second Governor of South Australia. Whittaker, seven other employees from Derbyshire, Gawler and his wife and children arrived on the Pestonjee Bomanjee on 12 October 1838 in Adelaide. They had traveled for four months via Rio de Janeiro. When Whittaker and Gawler arrived they found poor conditions so gardening was not important.
Whittaker collected plants around Adelaide in South Australia in 1839-40. Whittaker traveled to places within South Australia where he collected a wide range of plant samples. These included Mount Lofty range, Mount Jagged, River Torrens, River Murray and the Hindmarsh River. Whittaker was the first person to collect from the mountainous district of the Fleurieu Peninsula, Encounter Bay and Mount Barker. 

Whittaker stayed in South Australia for nineteen months before sailing home on the "Katherine Stuart Forbes" which left from Port Adelaide on 11 April 1840. On the way home his boat stopped four times at Kangaroo Island, Mauritius, St Helena and Corvo Island in the Azores. Whittaker collected further plant samples while the boat was in these harbours.

Whittaker arrived back in England on 23 September 1840 and by 1844 had begun collecting plants again. His activity peaked in 1851 and 52, ceasing sometime after 1867. He collected from many parts of Derbyshire, but he occasionally traveled outside the county including Bulwell, Nottinghamshire, Rhyl and Denbigh in Wales.

By 1846 he was living at Breadsall in Derbyshire where he was a teacher at Breadsall Boys School. From here he exchanged letters with Sir William J. Hooker Director of the Kew Botanic Gardens. Because Whittaker had planed to write a number of books on British botany, and needed to exchange some of his Australian and related samples for that. Whittaker collected about 300 plants that were eventually acquired by Kew. Whittaker's collections from outside the U.K. are now in Kew Gardens. Whittaker had the species of sundew "Drosera whittakeri" named after him.

In February 1847 Whittaker became a member of the Botanical Society of London and he swapped plant samples between 1849 to 1853 with its members. He then joined the Botanical Exchange Club and finally the Botanical Locality Record Club. By 1847 he had enough information to publish “a list of rare plants found in the neighbourhood of Breadsall, Derbyshire”. This contained a mixture of both rare and relatively common species, and gives a good information of the botanical variety of the area at that time. In 1857 he was the schoolmaster of ninety children at Breadsall in Derbyshire, a village whose inhabitants included the naturalists Rev. Henry Harpur Crewe and Francis Darwin. The school was funded by the Harpur-Crewe family.

Whittaker lived in the small village of Morley near Derby in the late 1850s.
He lived with his wife Mary in the house named Ferriby Brook.
He continued to teach there, taking up to twelve scholars into his classes, usually after they had left the local school, and were between eight and eighteen years of age. He eventually established a large collection of living plants. Local gardener groups reported that he was growing over 1,300 different species. In 1864 he was publishing works refering the local extinction of the "Lady's Slipper Orchid" Cypripedium calceolus with the Rev. Henry Harpur Crewe. By 1871 he quitted a schoolmaster, and became a “seedsman and florist”. By 1881 successfully became a “nurseryman and farmer”. He lived with two servants and twenty year old William Whitehead in his house. Whitehead was to eventually become a partner in their market gardening venture.

Whittaker’s plant collecting activities began to decline around 1863, around the time his botanical partner, Henry Harpur Crewe, moved away to become the Rector of Drayton Beauchamp in Buckinghamshire. In the following year they cooperated in the production of a manuscript list of the principal flowering plants and ferns of Derbyshire. His partnership with Crewe lasted for at least eighteen years and was very productive. The Harpur Crewe's family lived nearby Calke Abbey and they had funded the school at Breadsall.

In the late 1880s Joseph Whittaker gave valuable assistance, and supplied a range of plant samples, to Rev W.H.Painter who was preparing to publish a book on the Flora of Derbyshire. Many of Whittaker’s samples and records were also used by William Richardson Linton, vicar of Shirley in a further Flora of Derbyshire in 1903. 

Whittaker died on 2nd March 1894. By popular subscription, a memorial reading desk and engraved brass inscription were built for St Matthew's Church, Morley, where he was a church warden and where he was buried.

Whittaker's collection at Kew Gardens is from his trip to Australia and from ports where he stayed shortly during the way home. He also left a collection of 2,200 pressed plants in 79 volumes, mostly from Derbyshire, which are now held in the herbarium at Derby Museum and Art Gallery. They provide important evidential samples for local studies on the flora of Derbyshire. Due to his participation in botanical exchanges clubs, there are now Whittaker samples in many UK museum collections, including those at Bolton, Birmingham, Gloucester and Manchester. The Wisbech and Fenland Museum also has a small collection.

The carnivorous sundew species was scientifically described by the French botanist Jules Émile Planchon in 1848. This is commonly known as the "Scented Sundew" or "Whittaker's Sundew".

Cooper Creek

Cooper Creek (formerly Cooper's Creek) () is one of the most famous rivers in Australia. It is sometimes called the Barcoo River after one of its tributaries. It is one of three major Queensland river systems that flow into Lake Eyre. The water flow in Cooper Creek comes from monsoonal rains falling months earlier and many hundreds of kilometres away in eastern Queensland. At in length it is the second longest inland river system in Australia after the Murray-Darling system.

Charles Sturt named the river in 1845 after Charles Cooper, the Chief Justice of South Australia. The explorers Burke and Wills died from starvation in 1861 on the banks of Cooper Creek. John King survived the expedition with help from the Aborigines. Only ten years after the explorers' deaths, homesteads were being built along the creek. A station (farm) at Innamincka was the first permanent settlement in the area.

By 1880 the reliable water source had attracted many settlers. The whole area was taken up and stocked with cattle. This pushed the local Aborigines from their traditional lands. By 1900 their population was just 30, only 10% of the original number, as influenza and measles took their toll.

The creek starts west of the Great Dividing Range as two rivers, the Thomson from near Longreach and Charters Towers, and the Barcoo in the area around Barcaldine, about inland from Rockhampton. 

Cooper Creek spreads out into a vast area of channels, making its way south into the far south-west corner of Queensland before turning west into South Australia towards Lake Eyre. In most years, the water soaks into the earth, fills channels and waterholes, or simply evaporates without reaching Lake Eyre. In very wet years, however, it can flood the entire Channel Country and reach Lake Eyre after flowing through the Strzelecki Desert, Sturt Stony Desert and the Tirari Desert. Although the Cooper carries much more water than the Diamantina and the Georgina, it does not flow into Lake Eyre as often as those rivers. One reason is that much more water is lost than with the Diamantina or Georgina. During a flood Cooper Creek may be as wide as .

Most of the land around the Cooper is used for sheep and cattle grazing on natural grasslands. The rainfall is not reliable enough to grow crops. The soils are quite fertile, though generally heavy in texture and often crack when they dry out.

Irving Crane

Irving Crane (November 13, 1913 – November 17, 2001), nicknamed "the Deacon", was an American pool player from Livonia (near Rochester). He was frequent champion and leading player in the sport. He is most well known for his skill at the game of straight pool (14.1 continuous). He won six world billiards titles in this game. 

Crane became very interested in billiards when he was 11 years old. He started play on a toy pool table his brother received as a Christmas gift. His parents soon replaced their dining room table with a 4' by 8' pool table. Soon, Crane started to play in public at a local pool room. Crane could play all day and never get bored. He couldn't wait to get home from school and start to play pool.

Though he taught himself to play, at age 14 he ran 89 balls in straight pool at a local pool room. He called each shot in advance. His parents replaced the smaller table with a full size tournament table. Over the next ten years some of the best players , including Willie Hoppe and Andrew Ponzi, came to practice with Crne. Despite consistent play throughout his teenage years, Crane did not enter any tournaments until he was 23 years old.

In February 1939, at age 26, Crane sank 150 balls in a row against his opponent in an exhibition straight pool match. The game was played on a difficult 5' by 10' table in Layton, Utah. This was impressive. But the crowd cheered him, and he continued to play. He finally put 309 consecutive balls thus shattering the previous world record of 244 consecutive balls.

He won his first world title in 1942. Over the next thirty years, Crane won almost two dozen major championships, including the World Crown in 1946, 1955, 1966, 1968, 1970 and 1972, the Ballantine International Championship in 1965, the International Roundrobin championship in 1968, and the World Series of Billiards in 1978 at age 65. At the 1966 World Crown tournament, he ran 150 and out in the finals. He never let his opponent back to the table after an early safety battle. No other player has ever done this. Crane also holds the record for the most runner-up finishes for the World Crown with 13.

Crane found it hard to make a living only by playing pool, even though he was very skilled. In 1957, he began working as a Cadillac salesman at a dealership in Rochester, New York. He continued there for 17 years. At Rochester's annual auto show his dealership's exhibit had a pool table. Crane would run balls while answering questions. Working at a regular job was not Crane's first choice. In an interview with Sports Illustrated in 1969, he said "If I had to make a choice between selling cars and playing pool, I'd choose pool... The only time I've ever been really happy is when I was at a pool table."

He was "tall, lean man with the imperial bearing of the headmaster of Eton," Crane got the nickname "The Deacon" because of his gentlemanly ways, his very cautious approach to the game and his careful style of clothing. He always wore a conservative suit when he played. 

The "Los Angeles Times" interviewed Crane's wife Althea. They were married 64 years. She said, "A lot of people, if it was a hot day and there was no air conditioning, they'd take off their coat to play. But not Irving Crane." Minnesota Fats, once said, "Irv Crane would have been the only guy to notice the horse under Lady Godiva". Willie Mosconi criticized Crane for his cautious style. He wrote in his 1993 autobiography, "Willie's Game", that "Crane wouldn't take a shot unless his grandmother could make it." 

Crane became a member of the Billiard Congress of America's hall of fame in 1978. In 1999, Crane was number eight on "Billiard Digest's" fifty greatest players of the century. In 1980 Crane retired from professional play. He stopped playing entirely in about 1996. On 17 November 17 2001, four days after entering a nursing home, Crane died of natural causes. He was 88 years old.

The word "sexxx" (stylized "SeXXX") has been used as slang for the word "sex" (since at least 1840) but also has other uses. On Internet webpages, the spelling "sexxx" has been used, for years, to bypass scans or email filters which block the use of the spelling as "sex". The word also has been in Leet spellings, such as "betteR thAn sexxx".

With capital letters, the spelling "SeXXX" is a combination of the 2 words "sex"+"XXX" (rated for sexually explicit content). That form as "SeXXX" is often used in ads to indicate adult-rated pictures or videos. There is a 2004 book titled ""Net.seXXX"" or ""SeXXX: readings on sex, pornography, and the Internet"" by Dennis D. Waskul, editor (New York: Peter Lang Publishing).

However, because the word "sexxx" is not an official spelling, it often appears as the result of codes involving the letters "xx" as in computer software module names "KeXxx()" and "SeXxx()"

Freidrich Wilhelm Ludwig Leichardt (1813—1848) was a German naturalist and explorer who explored the north of Australia. In 1844 Leichhardt led a small group from Moreton Bay in the south east corner of Queensland west to Port Essington in the Northern Territory. This was a trip of 4,828km. They returned to Sydney by boat. He was presented with the Patrons Gold Medal by the Royal Geographical Society in London.

In 1848 he set out to cross the continent from east to west. He believed he could go north around the deserts to the coast of Western Australia, and then follow the coast south to the Swan River. After leaving the Darling Downs, Leichhardt's group disappeared. Many people searched, and there were stories about marked trees, or found items, but nothing was proved. 

In 2006 a small piece of brass with Leichhardt's name on it proved to be a genuine item from the explorer. It had been found in 1900 by an Aboriginal stockman in Western Australia, close to the Northern Territory border, in the area between the Great Sandy Desert and the Tanami Desert.

Taxis

A taxis (plural taxes) is an innate behavioral response by an organism to a directional stimulus. This means the organism automatically moves towards or away from the stimulus.

A taxis differs from a tropism (turning response, often plant growth towards or away from a stimulus) in that the organism has motility and shows movement towards or away from the stimulus source. 



Even single-celled organisms can show taxis.

<doc id="299817" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299817" title="Euglena">
Euglena

Euglena is a large genus of unicellular protists, which have both plant and animal characteristics.

All are motile by means of a flagellum (animal characteristic). Most have chloroplasts (alga and plant characteristic).

Euglenids are believed to descend from an ancestor that took up green algae by secondary endosymbiosis.

Over 1,000 species of "Euglena" have been described, and there are more to be discovered. Marin "et al." (2003) revised the genus to include several species without chloroplasts, formerly classified as "Astasia" and "Khawkinea". 

When acting as a heterotroph (animal), the "Euglena" surrounds a particle of food and consumes it by phagocytosis. When acting as an autotroph, the "Euglena" uses chloroplasts to produce sugars by photosynthesis. 

The number and shape of chloroplasts within "Euglena" varies greatly. "Euglena" are able to move through aquatic environments by using a large flagellum for locomotion. To detect light, the cell has an eyespot, a primitive organelle that filters sunlight into light-detecting, photo-sensitive structures at the base of the flagellum; allowing only certain wavelengths of light to hit it. 

This photo-sensitive area detects the light that is able to be transmitted through the eyespot. When such light is detected, the "Euglena" may shift its position to get better photosynthesis. 

The motility of Euglena also allows hunting. Most "Euglena" are considered mixotrophs: autotrophs in sunlight and heterotrophs in the dark. "Euglena" do not have plant cell walls, but have a pellicle instead. The pellicle is made of protein bands that spiral down the length of the "Euglena" and lie beneath the plasma membrane.

"Euglena" can survive in fresh and salt water. In low moisture conditions, "Euglena" forms a protective wall around itself and lies dormant as a spore until environmental conditions improve. "Euglena" can also survive in the dark by storing paramylon granules inside the chloroplast.

"Euglenas" reproduce asexually, and there has been no evidence of sexual reproduction. Reproduction includes transverse division and longitudinal division, which both occur in the active and encysted forms.

Laura Ruth Sadler (25 December 1980 – 19 June 2003) was an English actress best known for her role as nurse Sandy Harper in the BBC One hospital drama series "Holby City".

Sadler was born in Ascot, Berkshire, and took up television acting as a young girl. She was spotted as a future talent at the age of 6 by Dustin Hoffman, who had seen her in a play. After the play had finished Hoffman asked to meet the young actress. Before joining the cast of "Holby City", her best-known role had been as the character Judi Jeffreys in the children's television series "Grange Hill" from 1997 to 1999. In a tragic coincidence, her "Grange Hill" character was killed after slipping and falling out of a burning building, paralleling her real life death 4 years later. Laura also then played the part of Skirty Marm in a new BBC1 children's comedy, Belfry Witches. Skirty Marm and her friend Old Noshie (Lucy Davis) were teenage witches banished to earth from Witch Island; settling in a sleepy village where they caused mischief.

In 1996 she starred in the feature film "Intimate Relations" alongside Julie Walters, where she played a Lolita-like girl with a crush on her mother's adulterous lover. She joined the cast of "Holby City", a spin-off series from the long-running BBC medical drama series "Casualty", in the show's third series.

In the early hours of 15 June 2003, she fell 40 feet (12 metres) from the balcony of the Holland Park flat of her boyfriend and "Holby City" co-star George Calil after having taken alcohol and cocaine. She suffered severe head injuries, and never regained consciousness. Her family decided to remove her from life support on 18 June 2003 and she died at Charing Cross Hospital a day later. 

Her boyfriend, Calil, then aged 30, who played her character's drug-dealing boyfriend Sean Hunt in "Holby City", was arrested for questioning before being released on bail. On 26 June police announced that the death was being treated as accidental and no further action would be taken.

Laura continued to feature in pre-recorded episodes of "Holby City" after her death. Laura's mother took part in writing her daughter's character Sandy out of "Holby City"; in the episode, which was broadcast in September 2003, her character won the lottery and subsequently emigrated to Australia.

Otherwise, it just uses <nowiki></nowiki> to add commas, such as to show "6,000". In 99% of recent Wikipedia usage, there are relatively few articles using fractions (less than 1% of articles using Template:Convert show fractions).

The check, for fraction parts, uses parser-function <nowiki></nowiki> to split a number at "/" (if any, as in: 6+3/8) and then checks if part 2 (the denominator, after the slash) contains a number, to trigger use of ). Hence, the template uses:

Utility (computing)

In computing, a "utility" is a program or module which is used to give a general-purpose result, for many different uses. The important point is that a utility is intended for a wide range of users, rather than an "app" (application program) which might be intended for a specific small group of users.

The word "utility" has been used to mean a "general-purpose computing tool" for many decades, since at least 1960.

Euclid's Elements

Euclid's "Elements" (sometimes: "The Elements", Greek: "Stoicheia") is a large set of math books about geometry, written by the ancient Greek mathematician known as Euclid (c.325 BC–265 BC) in Alexandria (Egypt) circa 300 BC. The set has 13 volumes, or sections, and has been printed often as 13 physical books (numbered I-XIII), rather than one large book. It has been translated into Latin, with the title ""Euclidis Elementorum"". It is the most famous mathmetical text from ancient times.

Euclid collected together all that was known of geometry in his time. His "Elements" is the main source of ancient geometry. Textbooks based on Euclid have been used up to the present day. In the book, he starts out from a small set of axioms (that is, a group of things that everyone thinks are true). Euclid then shows the properties of geometric objects and of whole numbers, based on those axioms. 

The "Elements" also includes works on perspective, conic sections, spherical geometry, and possibly quadric surfaces. Apart from geometry, the work also includes number theory. Euclid came up with the idea of "greatest common divisors". They were in his "Elements". The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the greatest number that can divide evenly into both of the two numbers.

The geometrical system described in the "Elements" was long known simply as "geometry" and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today, that system is referred to as "Euclidean geometry", to distinguish it from other so-called "non-Euclidean geometries" which mathematicians discovered in the 19th century.

Occasionally in ancient times, writings were attributed to celebrated authors but were not written by them. It is in this way that the apocryphal books XIV and XV of the Elements were sometimes included in the collection. The spurious Book XIV was probably written by Hypsicles on the basis of a treatise by Apollonius of Perga. The book continues Euclid's comparison of regular solids inscribed in spheres. The chief result is that the ratio of the surfaces of the dodecahedron and icosahedron inscribed in the same sphere is the same as the ratio of their volumes.

The spurious Book XV was probably written, at least in part, by Isidore of Miletus. This book covers topics such as counting the number of edges and solid angles in the regular solids, and finding the measure of dihedral angles of faces that meet at an edge.

Help:Infobox

An infobox is a fixed-format table (often with 2 columns) to be added to the top right-hand corner of article pages. An infobox shows a summary of some common data that the articles share and sometimes to improve inter-page navigation to other article pages. The generalized infobox feature grew out of the original (taxonomy infoboxes) that editors developed to visually express the scientific classification of organisms.

Infobox have important facts and statistics of a type which are common to related articles. For instance, all animals have a scientific classification (species, family and so on), as well as a conservation status. Adding a to articles on animals therefore makes it easier to quickly find such information and to compare it with that of other articles.

Infobox templates are like fact sheets, or sidebars, in magazine articles. They quickly summarize important points in an easy-to-read format. However, they are "not" "statistics" tables in that they (generally) only summarize material from an article—the information should still be present in the main text, partly because it may not be possible for some readers to access the contents of the infobox. In particular, if infobox templates hide long columns of data inside collapsing tables, which means readers using assistive technology may miss their presence entirely.

Many infoboxes also emit microformats—see .

Sometimes infoboxes may contain abbreviations or other forms not included in the lead text. If so, then search engines may excerpt the infobox rather than the lead when searched with such text. So it's a good idea to have text in the infobox appear in the main page, but then such infoboxes have been accused of being less informative (see ).

In general, data in infobox templates should be:


Infoboxes are an extension of MediaWiki's feature, and as such their implementations are kept in the . There are two ways that editors typically want to access the underlying details of an infobox:


For example, the article "D-Terminal" contains an infobox. Simply edit the article page to determine which one:

The start of the template identifies the markup between the enclosing braces as an infobox instance. While the next word identifies the specific kind of infobox (in this case the "codice_1" infobox), the underlying template is still located in the Template namespace under .

In accordance with , editors should place an infobox at the top of an article after any and .

Infoboxes should have a documentation page that contains a convenient "blank" template that can be copied directly into the target article. The template consists of opening (codice_2) double braces that contain the name of the infobox and a list of parameters without values. An editor then fills in the value for each of the parameters to the right of the corresponding equals sign.

For example:

might be filled out like this:

In this example, the names of the parameters ("codice_3", "codice_4", "codice_5", "codice_6") are fixed in the design of the infobox and described in its documentation. A parameter that is misspelled or is not supported by the infobox implementation does not display at all.

The infobox documentation describes which parameters are required and which are optional. Required parameters display between triple braces (for example, codice_2) when previewed or saved. Optional parameters may be left empty or omitted entirely.

It is a good idea to seek the opinions of other editors before embarking on a design of a new infobox or redesign of an existing one. Most requirements are already met by an existing infobox and most of the remainder can be met with a tweak. Unnecessary duplication leads to clutter and article divergence. Prototype your new design in your own . Once prototyped, propose the infobox changes to the appropriate and gain before deploying your new design in the .

For detailed guidance on how to design infoboxes, see: "".

Requests to delete an infobox should be brought to the attention of and any s associated with the infobox. A template may be merged with another rather than deleted outright.

Template:Floatbox/doc

The is a markup to float the contents of parameter {1} as a box to show along the right-side boxes on a page, such as alongside an .

Some of the link-boxes might have an option "align=float" to use instead, but otherwise, this template can be used. A stack of link-boxes can be floated by listing all of them as parameter {1}. Note the following example, with 3 boxes to float:

The floated-box area will allow other text to wrap (to the left side), rather than blocking the fill/wrap of text below that point. Note, however, that the floated area will be as wide as the widest box within, so that text wrapped outside the area cannot fill any whitespace gaps inside the floatbox area.

Multiple use of Floatbox will cause each to float beside the others, in reverse order, right-to-left, across the page, such as the 3 instances:  <nowiki></nowiki>: 
Each box will float, left-ward, across the page. There is no limit to the number of multiple floatboxes used, and they will wrap to additional lines, so that all can fit across and down the page.

The parameters include:

Those parameters are optional, but parameter 1 is required.

Some other examples are floating bolded text (not a photo):

Floatbox can also be used to float 1 or more images across a page.

It might take some experience to learn how the box area floats, in combination with various images or on a page. The operation of Template:Floatbox is very quick, using the <table> feature of the HTML markup language.

Because auto-floating of portal boxes could cause a loss of margin control, the can be used, as needed in some articles, when floating a portal box would look better alongside an infobox (or right-side image).

The example here uses {Floatbox} to float 2 portal boxes (for Animals & Cats), as follows:
</nowiki>
The 2 portal-boxes are stacked together, and floated together as a stack, by both being listed in parameter 1 to {Floatbox}. Although the 2 portal-boxes were specified "below" the Mona Lisa image, because the infobox+image were also stacked together, then the {Floatbox} moved the 2 portal-boxes, even higher, alongside the infobox.<br>Normally, a portal-box would be stuck below the Mona Lisa image, causing this entire text section to format further below, and causing a large text-gap of empty whitespace to appear near the infobox. There is no limit to the number of portalboxes (or Commonscat boxes) which can be listed within a {Floatbox} call, such as in a stub or an article with many stacked images near the bottom. Using {Floatbox} is extremely efficient, due to being a short template which uses builtin tag <table> to float the boxes.

<doc id="299942" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299942" title="Gene duplication">
Gene duplication

Gene duplication (or gene amplification) is any duplication of a region of DNA that contains a gene.

Gene duplication is important in supplying raw genetic material – new genes – to biological evolution. This has been recognized since the 1930s. Recent genomic sequence data show that duplicated genes are common in all organisms surveyed. 
In classical genetics it may occur as an error in crossing-over during meiosis, or the duplication of an entire chromosome.

In non-classical genetics it may happen by a retrotransposition event. 

The second copy of the gene is often relatively free from selective pressure. Mutations of it have no deleterious effects to its host organism. Thus it accumulates mutations faster than a functional single-copy gene, over generations.

A duplication is the opposite of a deletion. Duplications arise from unequal crossing-over that occurs during meiosis between misaligned homologous chromosomes. The product of this recombination are a duplication at the site of the exchange and a reciprocal deletion.

Gene duplication is believed to play a major role in evolution; this idea was first suggested 100 years ago. Susumu Ohno was one of the most famous developers of this theory in his classic book "Evolution by gene duplication" (1970). Ohno argued that gene duplication is the most important evolutionary force since the emergence of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA).

Major genome duplication events are not uncommon. It is believed that the entire yeast genome underwent duplication about 100 million years ago. Plants are the most prolific genome duplicators. For example, wheat is hexaploid (a kind of polyploid), meaning that it has six copies of its genome.

The duplication of a gene results in an additional copy that is free from the kind of selection which reduces variability ('normalising' selection). This freedom from consequences allows for more mutations to be 'carried' in the population. Some of these might increase the fitness of the organism or code for a new function. 

The two genes that exist after a gene duplication event are called paralogs and usually code for proteins with a similar function and/or structure. By contrast, orthologous genes are ones which code for proteins with similar functions but exist in different species, and are created from species-splitting.

Gladstone (South Australia)

Gladstone is a small town in South Australia about 200 km north of Adelaide. In 2006 the population was 629.

It is in the middle of a farming area that grows wheat and raises sheep, but Gladstone is important because it has lots of very big buildings to store wheat, barley, durum wheat, peas, faba beans and fiesta beans. All together, these buildings store the biggest amount of grains in the Southern Hemisphere in a place not by the sea.

The railways are important to Gladstone so the grains can be moved to the sea and put on ships. The nearest place where this happens is Port Pirie. 

The railways are also important to move the grains to the big cities in Australia. Gladstone is on the biggest railway line in Australia that goes between Sydney in the east and Perth in the west. Railway lines also go south to Adelaide, and north to other small towns. Now, all of the railway lines are 4 ft 8 1⁄2 in (1,435 mm) apart. This is called standard gauge. Before 1970, the railway lines going north were 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) apart (narrow gauge), and the railway lines going south were 5 ft 3 in (1,600 mm) apart (broad gauge). All three "gauges" joined together in Gladstone. Look at the photo to see this. This is very rare. Before 1970, there were only three places in the whole world where this happened.

Broadcasting House

Broadcasting House is the headquarters and registered office of the BBC in Portland Place and Langham Place, London.

Broadcasting House is home to BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio 4, and BBC Radio 4 Extra and also houses the BBC Radio Theatre, where music and speech programmes (typically comedy for BBC Radio 4) are recorded in front of a studio audience. It is also the headquarters of the BBC itself and contains the offices of key figures within the organisation, such as the Director General.

The Original Construction of Broadcasting House took place in 1932, and opened on the 14 May 1932, 8 years after the corporation was created and was built as a housing for all their current operations, of offices and radio operations. Architect George Val Myer designed the building in collaboration with the BBC's civil engineer, M T Tudsbery. The original interiors were the work of the Australian-Irish architect Raymond McGrath. He set up and directed a team that included Serge Chermayeff and Wells Coates and designed the vaudeville studio, the associated green and dressing rooms, and the dance and chamber music studios in a flowing Art Deco style. It was later said of his efforts that "the designs for the BBC gave the first real fillip to industrial design in England".

The building was designed with the radio elements, such as the studios, in a central location constructed of Portland stone. The remainder of the building was steel framed and faced with Portland stone on the outside. These areas housed the offices, so that they could be both away from the noise of the radio operations, and have access to daylight. Issues with local residents also caused the structure to be changed: The east side of the building blocked out the light to local residents, and after complaints and seeking the right of ancient lights, the building was changed so that the East side of the building had a sloped roof. The building also faced issues with the fact that both the Bakerloo and the Victoria lines of the London Underground, as well as sewers 100 years old ran under the site.

The building also incorporated other elements, the ground floor of the building was fitted with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the street, as it was believed that to finance such a project (costing £25,000,000 in today's money) they would need to rent out the ground floor as a retail unit. This however never occurred, as the Corporation expanded so quickly the space was needed by the BBC.

Althea Gibson

Althea Gibson (August 25, 1927 – September 28, 2003) was a World No. 1 American sportswoman who became the first African-American woman to be a competitor on the world tennis tour and the first to win a Grand Slam title in 1956. She is sometimes known as "the Jackie Robinson of tennis" for breaking the color barrier. Gibson was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.

Althea Gibson was born at 9:00 am EDT on August 25, 1927 in Silver, Clarendon County, South Carolina to Daniel and Annie Bell Gibson. Althea had two siblings, a brother, Daniel Jr. (known as "Bubba") and a sister, Mildred. 
Gibson played tennis while going to shool for an education. In 1946, she moved to Wilmington, North Carolina, to work on her tennis game with Dr. Hubert A. Eaton and enrolled at Williston High School.

In 1958, Gibson retired from amateur tennis. Before the open era of tennis began, there was no prize money, other than an expense allowance, and no endorsement contracts. To begin earning prize money, tennis players had to give up their amateur status. As there was no professional tour for women, Gibson was limited to playing in a series of exhibition tours.

According to Lance Tingay of "The Daily Telegraph" and the "Daily Mail", Gibson was ranked in the world top ten from 1956 through 1958, reaching a career high of No. 1 in those rankings in 1957 and 1958. Gibson was included in the year-end top ten rankings issued by the United States Tennis Association in 1952 and 1953 and from 1955 through 1958. She was the top-ranked U.S. player in 1957 and 1958. In 1957 Althea became the first African American woman to win Wimbledon. She won again in 1958. In 1958, she appeared as the celebrity challenger on the TV panel show "What's My Line?".

In retirement, Gibson wrote her autobiography and in 1959 recorded an album, "Althea Gibson Sings", as well as appearing in the motion picture, "The Horse Soldiers." In 1964, she became the first African American woman to play in the Ladies Professional Golf Association. However, she was too old to be successful and only played for a few years.

In 1971, Gibson was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, and in 1975, she was appointed the New Jersey state commissioner of athletics. After 10 years on the job, she went on to work in other public service positions, including serving on the governor's council on physical fitness. In later years, she suffered two cerebral aneurysms and, in 1992, a stroke. A few years later, Gibson called her former doubles partner Angela Buxton and told her she was considering suicide, as she was living on welfare and unable to pay for rent or medication. Buxton arranged for a letter to appear in a tennis magazine. Buxton told Gibson nothing about the letter, but the latter received nearly US$1 million from around the world.

Gibson was married twice. Her first marriage to William Darben took place on October 17, 1965, but the couple was divorced in 1976, eleven years later. Darben died in 1995. She was also married to Sydney Llewellyn on April 11, 1983 and was divorced from him in 1988.

On September 28, 2003, at the age of 76, Gibson died in East Orange, New Jersey due to circulatory failure. She was buried there in the Rosedale Cemetery, at Orange, New Jersey. 

On the opening night of the 2007 US Open, the 50th anniversary of Gibson's victory at the US Championships in 1957 (now the US Open), Gibson was inducted into US Open Court of Champions. She was a 1994 inductee of the Sports Hall of Fame of New Jersey and 2009 inductee of the New Jersey Hall of Fame. In September 2009, the City of Wilmington, NC named its new community tennis complex the Althea Gibson Tennis Center.

Gibson became the first African American woman to join the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour, in 1964. Her best finish on the tour was a tie for second after a three-way playoff at the 1970 Len Immke Buick Open. Gibson retired from professional golf at the end of the 1978 season.

Common descent

In evolutionary biology, a group of organisms have common descent if they have a common ancestor. "There is strong quantitative support, by a formal test" for the theory that all living organisms on Earth are descended from a common ancestor.

Charles Darwin proposed the theory of universal common descent through an evolutionary process in "On the Origin of Species", saying, "There is a grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one".

The last universal ancestor (LUA) (or last universal common ancestor, LUCA), that is, the most recent common ancestor of all currently living organisms, is believed to have appeared about 3.9 billion years ago.

In the 1740s, Pierre-Louis Maupertuis made the first known suggestion that all organisms may have had a common ancestor, and that they had diverged through random variation and struggle for existence. In "Essai de Cosmologie", Maupertuis noted:

Could one not say that, in the fortuitous combinations of the productions of nature, as there must be some characterized by a certain relation of fitness which are able to subsist, it is not to be wondered at that this fitness is present in all the species that are currently in existence? Chance, one would say, produced an innumerable multitude of individuals; a small number found themselves constructed in such a manner that the parts of the animal were able to satisfy its needs; in another infinitely greater number, there was neither fitness nor order: all of these latter have perished... The species we see today are but the smallest part of what blind destiny has produced...

All known forms of life are based on the same fundamental biochemical organisation.

Genetic information is encoded in DNA, and transcribed into RNA, then translated into proteins by (highly similar) ribosomes, with ATP, NADH and others as energy sources, etc. 

The similarities include the energy carrier adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the fact that all amino acids found in proteins are left-handed (chirality). 

Furthermore, the genetic code (the "translation table" according to which DNA information is translated into proteins) is nearly identical for all known lifeforms, from bacteria to humans. 

The universality of this code is generally regarded by biologists as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent. Analysis of the small differences in the genetic code has also provided support for universal common descent. A statistical comparison of various alternative hypotheses has shown that universal common ancestry is significantly more probable than models involving multiple origins.

Another important piece of evidence is that it is possible to construct detailed phylogenetic trees (that is, "genealogic trees" of species) mapping out the proposed divisions and common ancestors of all living species. In 2010 an analysis of available genetic data, mapping them to phylogenetic trees, gave "firm quantitative support for the unity of life. ...there is now strong quantitative support, by a formal test, for the unity of life.

Traditionally, these trees have been built using morphological methods, such as appearance, embryology, etc. Recently, it has been possible to construct these trees using molecular data, based on similarities and differences between genetic and protein sequences. All these methods produce essentially similar results. That phylogenetic trees based on different types of information agree with each other is strong evidence of a real underlying common descent.

Accuracy and precision

In the fields of science, engineering, industry and statistics, the accuracy and precision of numbers have special meanings. The "accuracy" of a measurement system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantity's actual (true) value. In contrast, the "precision" of a measurement system (also called "reproducibility" or "repeatability") is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results. Although the two words can be synonymous in colloquial use, they are deliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method.
The word "precision" also refers to how fine the measurement is made, as the "resolution" of the measurement, such as to the nearest meter, centimeter, or yard, foot, inch, or nanometer.

A measurement system can be accurate but not precise, precise but not accurate, neither, or both. For example, if an experiment contains a systematic error, then increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not improve accuracy. The end result would be a consistent, yet inaccurate, set of results from the flawed experiment. Eliminating the systematic error improves accuracy but does not change precision.

A measurement system is designated "valid" if it is both "accurate" and "precise". Related terms include "bias" (non-random or directed effects caused by a factor or factors unrelated to the independent variable) and "error" (random variability).

The terminology is also applied to indirect measurements--that is, values obtained by a computational procedure from observed data.

In addition to accuracy and precision, measurements may also have a measurement resolution, which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a response in the measurement.

In the case of full reproducibility, such as when rounding a number to a representable floating point number, the word "precision" has a meaning not related to reproducibility. For example, in the IEEE 754-2008 standard, it means the number of bits in the significand (number of digits in the amount), so it is used as a measure for the relative accuracy with which a number can be shown.

<doc id="300043" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=300043" title="Humidex">
Humidex

The humidex ("Hyu-mah-deks") is a temperature index used by Canadian meteorologists to describe how hot the weather feels to a person, by adding the effect of heat and humidity. For example, if the temperature is and the calculated humidex is 40, then that means the humid heat feels like a dry temperature of . The index is widely used in Canadian weather reports during summer to give the discomfort level.

According to the Meteorological Service of Canada, a humidex of at least 30 causes "some discomfort", at least 40 causes "great discomfort" and above 45 is "dangerous". When the humidex hits 54, then heat stroke is very near.

The current formula for getting the humidex (see below: Humidex formula) was developed by J.M. Masterton and F.A. Richardson of Canada's Atmospheric Environment Service in 1979. The humidex differs from the heat index used in the United States, in being derived from the dew point rather than the relative humidity.

The record highest humidex in Canada occurred on July 25, 2007, when Carman, Manitoba hit 53.0. That number broke the previous record of 52.1 set during 1953 in Windsor, Ontario (The residents of Windsor would not have known it at the time, since the humidex had yet to be invented).

When the temperature is 30 °C (86 °F) and the dew point is 15 °C (59 °F), the humidex is 34. Note how humidex is a dimensionless number, but it indicates an approximate temperature in °C. If the temperature remains and the dew point rises to , the humidex rises to 42. The humidex tends to be higher than the U.S. heat index at equal temperature and relative humidity.

The humidex formula is as follows:

Heat index

The "heat index" (HI, also "humiture") is a measurement which combines air temperature and relative humidity as being the human-perceived equivalent temperature — how hot it feels. The result is also known as the "felt air temperature" or "apparent temperature". For example, when the temperature is with very high humidity, the heat index can be about .

The human body normally cools itself by perspiration, or sweating, which evaporates and carries heat away from the body. However, when the relative humidity is high, then the evaporation rate is reduced, so heat is removed from the body at a lower rate, causing it to retain more heat than it would in dry air. Measurements have been taken based on subjective descriptions of how hot subjects feel for a given temperature and humidity, allowing an index to be made which relates one temperature and humidity combination, to another, at a higher temperature in drier air.

The heat index was developed in 1978 by George Winterling as the "humiture" and was adopted by the National Weather Service a year later. It is derived from work carried out by Robert G. Steadman. Like the wind chill index, the heat index contains assumptions about the human body mass and height, clothing, amount of physical activity, thickness of blood, sunlight and ultraviolet radiation exposure, and the wind speed. Large deviations from the typical values will result in heat-index values which do not accurately reflect the perceived temperature.

In Canada, the similar humidex is used in place of the heat index. The humidex differs from the heat index in using the dew point rather than the relative humidity.

The heat index is defined so as to equal the actual air temperature when the partial pressure of water vapor is equal to a baseline value of 1.6 kPa. At standard atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa), this baseline corresponds to a dew point of 14 °C (57 °F) and a mixing ratio of 0.01 (10 g of water vapor per kilogram of dry air). This corresponds to an air temperature of 25°C and relative humidity of 50% in the sea-level psychrometric chart.

At high temperatures, the level of "relative" humidity needed to make the heat index higher than the actual temperature is lower than at cooler temperatures. For example, at approximately 27 °C (80 °F), the heat index will agree with the actual temperature if the relative humidity is 45%, but at about 43°C (110°F), any relative-humidity reading above 17% will make the Heat Index higher than 43°C (110 °F).

The heat index is calculated only if the actual temperature is above 27 °C (80 °F), dew point temperatures greater than 12 °C (54 °F), and relative humidities higher than 40%. The heat index and humidex figures are based on temperature measurements taken in the shade and not the sun, so extra care must be taken while in the sun.

Sometimes the heat index and the wind chill are denoted collectively by the single terms "apparent temperature" or "relative outdoor temperature".

Manhunter (movie)

Manhunter is an American movie. It is based on a book by Thomas Harris, called "Red Dragon". The movie was written and directed by Michael Mann. It stars Brian Cox, William Petersen, Dennis Farina and Tom Noonan. It tells the story of a serial killer and the detectives who are trying to find him.

"Manhunter" shows the way police can be similar to the people they chase. It also shows the science that police use to find criminals. This film was not the first film made from a book by Thomas Harris. "Black Sunday", "The Silence of the Lambs", "Hannibal", "Red Dragon" and "Hannibal Rising" were also made from his books. 

"Manhunter" did not get very good reviews when it came out. It did not make a lot of money in cinemas. It took $15 million to make "Manhunter" but the movie only made $8.6 million in the United States. Today the movie gets better reviews and is seen by more people. It is thought of as a 'cult movie'.

Will Graham (William Petersen) is a policeman who worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He retired after he caught a killer named Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox). Graham is asked by Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina) to help with a new police case. Crawford is trying to find a killer named "The Tooth Fairy". Graham goes to the house of the killer's victims. He finds The Tooth Fairy's fingerprints there.

Graham goes to a prison to meet Hannibal Lecktor again. Lecktor is very good at understanding how other people think. Graham asks him for help. It is very clear that Graham is afraid of Lecktor. Later on, a prison guard finds a letter that belongs to Lecktor. The letter is from The Tooth Fairy. Graham and Crawford find out that The Tooth Fairy is talking to Lecktor through advertisements in a newspaper. Graham asks the writer of the newspaper to help him make a false advertisement to trap The Tooth Fairy. The plan does not work. The writer of the newspaper is caught by The Tooth Fairy. The Tooth Fairy (Tom Noonan) kills the writer. 

The Tooth Fairy, whose real name is Francis Dollarhyde, works with pictures. He is attracted to a woman he works with called Reba McClane. Reba is blind. Dollarhyde drives her home one night. They start a relationship with each other. This stops Dollarhyde from killing more people. One night Dollarhyde sees Reba with another man. He thinks she is having an affair but he is mistaken. Dollarhyde kills the other man and takes Reba to his house.

Graham has found out how The Tooth Fairy finds his victims. The Tooth Fairy uses the home movies brought to his job to pick a family to kill. Now that he knows this, Graham is able to find out who The Tooth Fairy is. He goes to Dollarhyde's house with several policemen. Dollarhyde uses a shotgun to kill some of the policemen. Graham kills Dollarhyde and rescues Reba.


The movie was going to be named "Red Dragon" because this was the name of the book. The name was changed because it sounded like a karate movie. It was also changed because a movie named "Year of the Dragon" did very badly in cinemas. 

William Petersen worked with policemen in Chicago and with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to learn more about his part. Michael Mann took three years to write the movie, and he also spoke to policemen to learn about their jobs. Because of this, books have said the movie is very true to real life.

Tom Noonan started getting ready for the film by reading about other serial killers. He did not like this idea when he started. He changed his mind and acted his own way instead. He said he wanted The Tooth Fairy to seem like "he was doing this out of love". Joan Allen played Dollarhyde's blind girlfriend. She went to the New York Institute for the Blind to learn about blind people. She walked with a mask on to learn about being blind. 

Actors John Lithgow, Mandy Patinkin, William Friedkin and Brian Dennehy were all asked to play Hannibal Lecktor. Brian Cox played the part instead. Cox read about a Scottish serial killer named Peter Manuel to learn about his part. William Petersen played Will Graham. He was chosen because Michael Mann liked his film "To Live and Die in L.A.". Richard Gere, Mel Gibson and Paul Newman were also asked to play the part. Tom Noonan says he was asked to act his part because Michael Mann thought he was very scary in real life.

Dante Spinotti, who filmed the movie, made use of strong colors. Parts of the movie with Will Graham and his wife use a "romantic blue". Parts that show The Tooth Fairy use an ugly green or purple color. 

When the move was being made, Tom Noonan asked that nobody saw him. Those people who could saw him called him "Francis", because he pretended to be his character the whole time. This made the other actors afraid of him. The first time Noonan met William Petersen was when Petersen jumped through a large window while making the last part of the film. At first, actor Tom Noonan wore a fake tattoo of a dragon on his chest. The parts of the movie that showed this were made again without the tattoo. This is because Michael Mann and Tom Noonan thought it did not look right.

"Manhunter"'s soundtrack album came out in 1986. It could be bought on cassette, tape and vinyl record but not on CD. In March 2010, the soundtrack came out on CD for the first time. One more song, named "Jogger's Stakeout" by The Reds, was on the CD.

Music in the film's screen credits which are not listed above included:
Books written about the movie discuss the relationship between Graham and The Tooth Fairy. They make a comparison between the characters and how they both live. It has also been said that movie gives the idea that to catch a killer you must think like one.

"Manhunter" came out in the United States on 15 August 1986. It earned $8,620,929 in the United States. Its budget was $15 million, so it did not make as much money as it cost. It was shown in November 1987 during the London Film Festival and came out in the United Kingdom on 24 February 1989. In France, the film was shown on 9 April 1987 at the Cognac Festival du Film Policier. It won the Critics Prize at this festival. It was also shown at the 2009 Camerimage Film Festival in Łódź, Poland. On 19 March 2011, the film was showne at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood for its 25th anniversary. Michael Mann answered questions at this event.

"Manhunter" came out on laserdisc in 1986. It also came out on VHS several times. It came out on DVD first in 2000. This DVD was made by Anchor Bay Entertainment and it could be bought with one disc or two discs. A different DVD also came out in 2003. In 2004, MGM also made a DVD of the movie. In 2007, "The Hannibal Lecter Collection" came out. This was a collection of "Manhunter", "The Silence of the Lambs" and "Hannibal". "The Hannibal Lector Collection" also came out on Blu-ray in September 2009.

When "Mannhunter" came out, its reviews were not very good. 

Reviews thought that the music and the color effects were not very good. William Petersen's acting was also thought of negatively. The "New York Times" thought the movie was very bad, and so did the "Chicago Tribune". The "Los Angeles Times" said the movie was too much like Michael Mann's television program "Miami Vice"; and so did "Film Threat", who thought that was why the movie did not do very well. The "San Francisco Chronicle" did not like the movie's acting. On the other hand, "Time" magazine liked the movie. It called "Manhunter" "bold" and "intelligent." Leonard Maltin liked the movie, and called it "gripping".

Today, the reviews for the movie are much better. Salon.com says it is the best Hannibal movie. "Slate" magazine also thought it was very good, and said it inspired television programs like "Millennium" and "". "The Independent", Film4, Sky Movies, BBC, "Total Film"' magazine and "Empire" magazine have all praised the movie as being very good. Television channel Bravo put the movie in a program named "30 Even Scarier Movie Moments" in 2007. The website UGO Networks thought that Tom Noonan's acting in "Manhunter" was the best he has done.

Today, "Manhunter" is more popular. It is thought of as a 'cult movie'. This new popularity might be because of the other Hannibal films doing very well. The websites Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes compare the modern reviews of the movie and give an average review. Metacritic used ten reviews to give "Manhunter" a score of 78 out of 100. Rotten Tomatoes used 33 reviews to give the movie a score of 94 out of 100.

"Manhunter" shows how police use forensic science to catch criminals. This has inspired other movies and television programs. These include "", "Millennium", "John Doe", "Profiler", and "The X-Files"; as well as films such as "Copycat", "Switchback", "The Bone Collector", "Seven" and "Fallen".

"The Silence of the Lambs" came out in 1991. It was based on a different book by Thomas Harris. It earned many awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture. It is one of only three films that have won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Screenplay. After "The Silence of the Lambs", three more Hannibal films came out. These were "Hannibal", "Red Dragon" and "Hannibal Rising".

The 2002 movie "Red Dragon" was based on the same book as "Manhunter". It made much more money than "Manhunter" did. It earned $209,196,298 and it cost $78 million to film it. Rotten Tomatoes used 183 reviews to give "Red Dragon" a score of 68 out of 100. Metacritic used 36 reviews to give it a score of 60 out of 100. The same man, Dante Spinotti, did the filming for both movies.

Great White Spot

The Great White Spot, also known as Great White Oval, on Saturn, is a name given to storms that are large enough to be seen by telescope from Earth. The spots appear to be white, and the name was based on Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The spots can be several thousands of kilometers wide. Currently, a large band of white clouds called the Northern Electrostatic Disturbance (because of an increase in radio and plasma interference) has covered Saturn since 2010, and the Cassini orbiter is tracking the storm. Cassini information shows a loss of acetylene in the white clouds, an increase of phosphine, and an unusual temperature drop in the center of the storm. In April 2011, the storm had a second eruption. Scientists believe the white spots are made from ammonia ice pushed up by warmer gas through the tops of the planet's clouds.

The spots happen every 28.5 Earth years. This is the solstice when Saturn's northern hemisphere tilts most toward the Sun. The following is a list of recorded sightings; years with spots that are part of the cycle are 1876, 1903, 1933, 1960, and 1990.


Why there were no spots recorded before 1876 is a mystery. It is like the break in sightings of the Great Red Spot in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The 1876 Great White Spot was very large, and could be seen even with small telescopes. Was the earlier record simply poor, or was the 1876 GWS truly a first for the telescopic era? Some believe that neither scenario is likely.

Mark Kidger has described three important Great White Spot patterns:

Kidger predicts that the next Great White Spot will happen in the NTZ in 2016, and will probably be less spectacular than the 1990 Great White Spot.

A "classic" Great White Spot is a spectacular event. Very bright white storms light up Saturn's usually dull atmosphere. All the major ones have happened in the planet's northern hemisphere. They usually begin as separate "spots", but then rapidly get bigger in longitude, as the 1933 and 1990 Great White Spots did. In 1990 the Great White Spot grew to circle the whole planet..

Wikipedia:Avoiding MediaWiki expansion depth limit

This essay, WP:Avoiding MediaWiki expansion depth limit, covers issues about the MediaWiki version 1.16 "expansion depth limit" for the nesting of s and if-logic. All during 2009-2010, the nesting limit has been only a mere 40 levels of nested if-then-else (or nested templates) invoked inside other templates. The severe limit is so restrictive that some templates cannot function properly when invoked inside other large templates. NOTE THE DANGER: When the depth limit is exceeded, not all templates die, but rather, they simply generate the wrong results (from the remainder of the template) and keep going, "as if nothing were wrong". The technical limits of expansion depth are explained in the pages:
The limits were chosen to thwart denial of service (DoS) attacks being caused by very large or complex templates.

What is not affected: Typically, large templates can be invoked, together, in article text without reaching the limit. The main worry is when using large templates inside an or deeper inside the markup of other templates (when editing a large template). For example, the large template {} can be used with {} to "show" the length of 2 meters:
Using large templates together in an article paragraph is rarely a problem.

Reducing expansion depth: The nest-levels can be reduced, inside large templates, by rewriting some of the nested if-else-if-else logic as non-nested if-then-if-then-if-then, or using a #switch outside of the if-then logic. In some cases, avoiding the use of other templates inside a template can also reduce the nesting: whereas using a #ifexpr increases the depth by 1 level, invoking another template containing that #ifexpr increases depth by 2 levels. Putting a default value in a parameter does NOT increase the nesting level: <nowiki> and </nowiki> are both at zero (0) levels of nesting.

The current limit (as 40 levels of nested templates) can be demonstrated by the following live examples which repeatedly nest the to try multiple levels:


By contrast, the following examples, with more than 40 nested templates, will cause problems, as with excessively nested templates all during 2009-2010:


However, when the outer nesting is reduced, then the count (for the string length) reaches the accurate figure of 29:
The amount of nesting, required to run a template, often depends on the particular values of the parameters, such as the following examples with a 39-long string:
Outside of the deep nesting, then the template runs fine:

Fortunately, many common templates can be rewritten to unnest the if-else logic or avoid using too many embedded templates. Some examples of highly efficient templates are:
Those templates were specifically designed to use the minimal nesting of if-else logic and avoid too many embedded templates.

Because not everyone working in Wikipedia has been trained in the limits of the MediaWiki software, even some of the might not be aware how the nested if-else logic has been limiting the use of templates inside of other large templates. Consequently, many people have tried to write templates as if they were writing computer software for modern computer systems, totally unaware of the unusual restriction of 40 levels of nested logic, where other computer software would allow 300, or perhaps unlimited, levels of nesting.

Parentheses

Parentheses (or "brackets" in UK, singular: parenthesis) are the curved punctuation marks "(  )" used in text. They are noted as left/right: the "left parenthesis" is "(" and the "right parenthesis" is ")". They are also called "round brackets", "curved brackets", "oval brackets", or, colloquially, parens. 

Parentheses have several different meanings, such as:
There are also other uses for parentheses.

Parentheses enclose text which could be left out, without destroying or altering the meaning of a sentence. In most writing, overuse of parentheses is usually a sign of a badly structured text. A milder effect may be obtained by using a pair of commas around the text, although if the sentence contains commas for other uses, then visual confusion may result.

Parentheses may be used in formal writing to add more information, such as in:
They can also note "either singular or plural" for nouns, such as in the word "claim(s)".

In general, "brackets" are tall punctuation marks used in matched pairs within text, to set apart or interject other text. In the United States, "bracket" usually refers specifically to the "square" or "box" type. In British usage, "bracket" normally refers to the "round" type, which is called a "parenthesis" mark in American usage.

Wikipedia:Avoiding POV funnels

This essay, WP:Avoiding POV funnels, advises to avoid limiting topics as being constrained by a point-of-view funnel which limits the possible range of related viewpoints into an overly narrow range. Sometimes, there is a need to have more than one page, about a topic, to avoid a single article from restricting the coverage about topics.

Within an article page, the particular wording of a section header can overly limit the allowable text of the section. For example, the header ""Media criticism of aardvark film"" pre-supposes a negative viewpoint that the news media disliked the film, whereas the alternative header ""Media response to aardvark film"" allows a balance, for either negative or positive views, in the section, and does not limit the text into a "POV funnel" which would restrict the contents. Some words, such as "criticisms" or "scandals" have loaded meanings and should be avoided in headers or titles.

Many topics directly relate to other major topics, and a single article page cannot adequately cover all the information, in a balanced manner, because some topics would have far more detail than others within the same page. In some cases, details have been suppressed, or even removed, in an effort to artificially balance all aspects within a single article. Instead, per , an article could be split into "content forks" (dividing the total contents into separate articles on notable subtopics). Although POV-forks are discouraged, content forks are commonly used to split articles into major, sub-topics.
For example, a renowned scientist might have made a scientific development, perhaps as an invention or scientific theory, which has "independent notability" as a separate topic, outside the article about the scientist. Any attempts to limit the related text, about that development, to being only a section of the scientist's bio-page article, would be an example of a POV-funnel.
The scope of details needed to adequately describe, or explain, the particular development could be considered as being an level of details, if included within the scientist's bio-page.

However, when the scientific development is described in a separate article, there would be ample space to expand the necessary details, plus examples, diagrams or charts, to fully describe the major aspects.
A similar example would be a separate article for a concert tour of a notable musician, rather than trying to describe the concert tour inside the musician's bio-page. The extent of concert details would likely be overwhelming to the remainder of the bio-page, when fully describing the concert themes and set designs, plus the typical song play list, and list of cities toured (etc.). More commonly, every major album, as released by a recording artist, is given a separate article, and thereby avoids cluttering the text of the musician's bio-page article.

By having separate articles for albums, concert tours, scientific inventions (etc.), then POV-funnels can be avoided in other articles, such as the bio-page articles of musicians, scientists, etc.

In some extreme cases, a POV funnel might be used to purposely restrict what text sections, or images, are allowed within an article. The situation can be seen as a trap, deliberately intending to restrict the information "allowed" in Wikipedia. 

Often, there might be claims that other text (or images) are details, beyond the scope of the narrowed article page. However, per policy , articles cannot omit information, even if considered offensive to some people's religion, moral code, or an organization's bylaws. The goal of Wikipedia is to "write the encyclopedia" not to thwart it or suppress it.
Never the less, some arguments to omit information, as being WP:UNDUE clutter, can be very persuasive, and hence, a POV funnel is typically an effective way to suppress information, or justify axing large sections of text from an already overly-long article. Consequently, some violent debates have arisen as to what is allowed in each article, or section, and there have been storms of edit-wars or sanctions sought to prevent users from adding text. Instead, users should be reminded that even featured articles are often quite long, and the appropriate way to shorten a long article would be to split into subarticles, or move text into previous articles which could be expanded.

The finds the location, in parameter {1} with length lenstr=15 (up to 99), of the text string {2} with length {3}. It uses a simple, quick method to compare the strings. If the string is not found, the result is zero (0), indicating no match. The parameter lenstr can be shorter than the actual 1st string, to stop the search earlier (and faster). The template was designed to use only 5 levels of expansion depth, rather than 18 or more levels as in other string-searching templates.

If the length of the substring {2} is not known, or changes often, then the extra template {strlen_quick} can be used as: {{strlen_quick|{{{2}}} }}, to determine the length of string 2, quickly.

The following are examples:

The operation of Template:Strfind_short was designed to run 4x times faster than other string-search templates, and use only 5 levels of expansion depth (not 18). However, it typically runs 20x times faster (or shorter) for strings up to 15 characters long. The post-expand include size averages about 300 bytes (rather than 6,000 bytes for other string-search templates). It can be used over 5,000 times per page (compared to only 350 times for other search templates). For strings over 50 long, it will use more resources, due to processing strings larger than other templates had allowed.

Rahm Emanuel

Rahm Israel Emanuel (; born November 29, 1959) is an American politician and the 55th and current Mayor of Chicago. Before this he was White House Chief of Staff for President Barack Obama. He was senior advisor for President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 1998 and as a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives, representing , from 2003 until his resignation in 2009 to become a member of the Obama Administration.

Emanuel was chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during the 2006 mid-term elections and remained a top strategist for House Democrats during the 2008 cycle. After Democrats regained control of the House in 2006, Emanuel was elected chairman of the Democratic Caucus. This made him the fourth-ranking House Democrat, behind Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn.

Two days after Obama's election victory, Emanuel was announced as Obama's designee for White House Chief of Staff. He resigned from the House on January 2, 2009, and began his duties as Chief of Staff on January 20, 2009, the day of Obama's inauguration. 

Emanuel resigned as Chief of Staff effective October 1, 2010, in order to run for Mayor of Chicago pending the announced retirement of six term incumbent Richard M. Daley. On January 27, 2011, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed a lower court's ruling that had cast doubt on Emanuel's candidacy; the court unanimously decided that Emanuel did not abandon his Chicago residency by serving in the White House, thus affirming his ability to run for mayor. He won the Mayoral election on February 22, 2011, with 55% of the vote. President Obama appointed William M. Daley, the brother of Emanuel's predecessor as mayor, as Chief of Staff to replace Emanuel.

The mayoral term in Chicago was one year from 1837 through 1863, when it was increased to two years. In 1907 it was again lengthened to four years, the present duration. Until 1861, municipal elections were held in March. In that year, legislation changed them to April. In 1869, however, election time was changed to November, and terms expiring in April of that year were lengthened. In 1875, the election day was moved back to April by the city's vote to operate under the Cities and Villages Act of 1872.

The crow tries to push the pitcher over but fails to do so. It drops pebbles in the pitcher, one by one, until the water rises to the top of the pitcher which allows the crow to drink.

Languages of Africa

The languages of Africa include more than 3,000 languages. These languages include native languages (languages that come from Africa) and colonial languages, which were brought to Africa by colonists from Europe. The continent has the highest concentration of languages in the world. At least 30% of the world's languages come from and are spoken in Africa. 

Over the years, many African languages have died out and become extinct. This happens for several reasons, including wars and genocide by other African tribes. Other languages were abandoned, or its speakers disappeared.

There are more than 3,000 languages spoken in Africa. These languages are grouped into several major language families. Linguists do not agree about which groupings are "correct" and valid.
Most linguists organize the African languages into four major language families. These are:
This classification of languages is based on the research of the linguist Joseph Greenberg, who published "The Languages of Africa" in 1963.
The African languages were traditionally (historically) organized into six language families. Today, some linguists doubt that some of these groupings are valid. The six traditional families are:
Still other linguists believe that the Nilo-Saharan languages and the Niger-Congo languages are part of the same family. These linguists organize the African languages into only three language families: Niger-Congo languages, Afroasiatic languages, and Khoisan languages.
No matter how the major language families are organized, there are many smaller families and language isolates. In addition, there are some obscure (rare, uncommon) languages that are not yet classified into any family. Africa also has some sign languages, which are mostly language isolates.

The goalkeeper of Wattens, Friedl Koncilia often played instead of him so Rettensteiner, after the second title with Innsbruck, went to SK VOEST Linz. 1975 he went on to SV Austria Salzburg, where he played in the first and second division till 1982. In his time with Salzburg he scored two penalty goals. After the end of his professional career he became part of the coaching team of SV Austria Salzburg and was coach of SV Grödig. 
He played his first match for the national football team on 12 April 1970 versus CSSR when he came in in the second halftime. In thhis time with the team he often changed with Friedl Koncilia. He played his last international match in 1974.

Wikipedia:Wikitable

A wikitable is a box of rows and columns used to show data, on a page. The box can be surrounded by lines (a "border") to show the edges of the box. Tables can use many different styles and tricks to show data in colors, or shifted ("aligned") to the left, right or center. This page shows how to make wikitables in Wikipedia.

There are many tables shown below, so perhaps just scroll down the page, or use the browser find-button, to see a table like what is needed. Otherwise, reading all the tables on the whole page could use over 1 hour of time.

The following is an example of a table with 4 cells, which shows the 2-by-2 table, at the right-hand side of the page.
The above markup shows the table AA/BB/CC/DD to the right:
The following shows the same type of table, but with a border, to show lines around the box area.
The above markup, with a border, shows the table to the right:

This next table will show lines around each cell in the table.
The above markup, with class=wikitable, shows the table to the right:

Adding style="margin-right:0" pushes table to right margin:

The other examples, below, have more ways to show text or pictures in a table.

Although HTML table syntax also works, special wikicode markup can be used as a shortcut to create a table. The pipe (vertical bar) codes function exactly the same as HTML table markup, so a knowledge of HTML table code will help in understanding pipe code. The shortcuts are as follows:
 <nowiki></nowiki>
 <nowiki></nowiki>
 <nowiki></nowiki>
 <nowiki></nowiki>
 <nowiki></nowiki>
 <nowiki></nowiki>
which is probably not what you want:

However, the format modifier is useful:

Just remember: no more than 2 single pipes on a line!

 <nowiki></nowiki>
 <nowiki></nowiki>
 <nowiki></nowiki>
The final table would display like this:

The table parameters and cell parameters are the same as in HTML, see http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/tables.html#edef-TABLE and Table (HTML). However, the codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, and codice_8 elements are currently not .

A table can be useful even if none of the cells have content. For example, the background colors of cells can be changed with cell parameters, making the table into a diagram, like . An "image" in the form of a table is much more convenient to edit than an uploaded image.

Each row must have the same number of cells as the other rows, so that the number of columns in the table remains consistent. For empty cells, use the non-breaking space codice_9 as content to ensure that the cells are displayed. To show a visible pipe in a cell, use <nowiki>|</nowiki> or &#124;.

With colspan and rowspan cells can span several columns or rows, see the example below. However, this has the disadvantage that does not work properly anymore.

Both of these generate the same output. Choose a style based on the number of cells in each row and the total text inside each cell.

The wiki markup code:

As it appears in a browser (note that there are no borders):

Here is the wiki markup code:
As it appears in a browser (see ""):

Two ways of specifying of text and background for a single cell are as follows. The first form is preferred because the second form uses deprecated HTML:

The wiki markup code:
As it appears in a browser:
Like other parameters, colors can also be specified for a whole row or the whole table; parameters for a row override the value for the table, and those for a cell override those for a row. (Note that there is no easy way to specify a color for a whole column—each cell in the column must be individually specified. Tools can make it easier.):

The wiki markup code:
As it appears in a browser:
To make the table blend in with the background, use codice_10 or codice_11. (Warning: codice_12, does not work with some browsers, including IE6!)

To force a cell to match one of the default colors of the codice_13 option, use codice_14 for the darker header, and codice_15 for the lighter body.

See : style, background, list of colors, web colors

The width and height of the whole table can be specified, as well as the height of a row. To specify the width of a column one can specify the width of an arbitrary cell in it. If the width is not specified for all columns, and/or the height is not specified for all rows, then there is some ambiguity, and the result depends on the browser.

The wiki markup code:
As it appears in a browser:
Note that codice_16inline CSScodice_17 has no effect with some browsers. If compatibility is important, equivalent older constructs like codice_18 should work on more browsers.

To force column widths to specific requirements, rather than accepting the width of the widest text element in a column's cells, follow this example. Note that wrap-around of text is forced.

The wiki markup code:

To set column widths in a table without headers, specify the width in the first cell for each column, like this:

One application of setting the widths is aligning columns of consecutive tables:

In a table that spans the entire width of a page, cells narrower than the widest cell tend to wrap. To keep an entire column from wrapping, use style=white-space:nowrap in a non-header cell on the longest/widest cell to affect the entire column.

That can be done by using as in: "{{nowrap|Words to keep together}}".

Table borders default to a complex shaded double-line (the default in HTML); however, those borders can be set to a thin solid line by using a style-parameter (style="border: 1px solid darkgray"), as in the following ("Note: if you intend to use the 'cellpadding' or 'cellspacing' options along with a border, you MUST use this format"):
Note the bottom-row texts are centered by 'align="center"' while star-images were not centered.

As long as the "Image:" specs omit the parameter "thumb|" they will not show the caption lines in the table (only during mouse-over). The border color "darkgray" matches typical tables or infoboxes in articles; however, it could be any color name (such as style="border: 1px solid darkgreen;") or use a hex-color (such as: #DDCCBB).

A column format-specifier (enclosed in "|...|") can have a style-parameter to set borders on each cell, as follows:

Note only the image cells, here, have individual borders, not the text.

The lower hex-colors (such as: #616161) are closer to black. Typically, all borders in a table would be one specific color.

By default data in tables is vertically centrally aligned, which results in odd-looking layouts like this:

To fix this, apply the valign="top" attribute to the rows (unfortunately it seems to be necessary to apply this individually to every single row). For example:

You can position the table itself, the contents of a row, and the contents of a cell, but not with a single parameter for all the contents of the table. See . 

Prior to April 2009, using "float" to position a table was discouraged; however, it no longer always breaks page rendering at large font sizes. See a floated image, below, under "Floating images in the center".

"Note: This example is not , and should be avoided as much as possible. For example, nested tables (tables inside tables) should be separated into distinct tables when possible."

Here's a more advanced example, showing some more options available for making up tables. Note however that with colspan and rowspan does not work properly anymore.

You can play with these settings in your own table to see what effect they have. Not all of these techniques may be appropriate in all cases; just because you can add colored backgrounds, for example, doesn't mean it's always a good idea. Try to keep the markup in your tables relatively simple -- remember, other people are going to be editing the article too! This example should give you an idea of what is possible, though.

The wiki markup code:
As it appears in a browser:
The wiki markup coding:
As it appears in a browser:
A table can be used to wrap an image, so that the table can float towards the center of the page (such as using: style="float: right;"). However, the table margins, border and font-size must be precisely set to match a typical image display. The Image-spec parameter "thumb|" (although auto-thumbnailing to user-preference width) forces a wide left-margin that squeezes the nearby text, so the parameter "center|" can be added to suppress the left-margin padding. However, "center" sometimes shoves the caption to a 2nd line (under a centered box "[]"), so "thumb|" could be omitted and just hard-code the image size, adding a gray (#BBB) border. Using precise parameters to match other images, a floating-image table can be coded as follows:
The text inside the floating-table is sized by style="font-size: 86%;". That floating-image table floats a typical image-box, but allows adjusting the left-hand margin of the image (see temple-example floating below).

The caption-text can be omitted, or remove the parameter "thumb|" so the caption is hidden until "mouse-over display". Unfortunately the parameter "thumb|" (used for displaying the caption) also controls the auto-thumbnailing to re-size images by user-preferences size. In April 2009, it was not possible to have auto-thumbnail sizing while also concealing the caption: parameter "thumb|" triggers both actions and forces the caption to display.

An image set with parameter "left|" will gain a wide right-side margin (opposite margin of parameter "right|"), so floating toward the left would require an image set as "center|" inside a table with style="float:left; margin:0.46em 0.2em".

Recall that, outside an image-table, the parameter "right|" causes an image to align (either) above or below an infobox, but would not float alongside the infobox.

Note the "order of precedence": first come infoboxes or images using "right|", then come the floating-tables, and lastly, any text will wrap that can still fit. If the first text-word is too long, no text will fit to complete the left-hand side, so beware creating a "ragged left margin" when not enough space remains for text to fit alongside floating-tables.

If multiple single image-tables are stacked, they will float to align across the page, depending on page-width. The text will be squeezed to allow as many floating-tables as can fit, as auto-aligned, then wrap whatever text (can still fit) at the left-hand side.

That auto-aligning feature can be used to create a "floating-gallery" of images: a set of 20 floating-tables will wrap (backward, right-to-left) as if each table were a word of text to wrap across and down the page. To wrap in the typical direction (wrapping left-to-right) define all those floating-tables, instead, as left-side tables using the top parameter style="float:left; margin:0.46em 0.2em". Multiple floating-images empower more flexible typesetting of images around the text.

"Note: because they cause , nested tables should be avoided whenever possible."
Seven different (blue) tables are shown nested inside the cells of a table. Automatically the two tables |A| and |B|B| are vertically aligned instead of the usual side by side of text characters in a cell. "float" is used to fix each of tables |C| and |D| to their own position within one cell of the table. This may be used for charts and schemes. "Nested tables must start on a new line."

Wiki markup
As it appears in a browser:
Note that using codice_19 for cell G combined with codice_20 for cell F to get another row below G and F won't work, because all (implicit) cells would be empty.
Likewise complete columns are not displayed if all their cells are empty. Borders between non-empty and empty cells might be also not displayed (depending on the browser), use codice_9 to fill an empty cell with dummy content.

Centered tables can be achieved, but they will not "float"; that is to say, no text will appear to either side. The trick is <nowiki>
Also note that the tag "<small>" made a smaller text-size caption. However, fonts also can be sized by percent (style="font-size: 87%;"), where the actual percent-size as displayed depends on the various sizes allowed for a particular font.

The column attribute, above, uses "style=" to set the font-size for the caption, following the 2nd vertical-bar "|".

A font-size: 65% is very small, while style="font-size: 87%;" is a mid-size font, larger than the tag <small>.

Actual transfer/display speeds depend on individual files. In 2007 to March 2009 some serious flaws existed in the thumbnailing process when combined with the gallery-display, making thumbnails sometimes larger than the originals. For this reason some users explicitly used tables instead of the gallery tag. However, these issues are fixed as of March 2009.

To convert from spreadsheets such as Gnumeric, MS Excel or OpenOffice.org Calc, you can use the Copy & Paste Excel-to-Wiki converter or you can save your spreadsheets as .csv and use the csv2wikitable converter.

Due to the complexity of wikimarkup (especially tables), a common question is if there is any visual editor to make creating and modifying tables easier. Unfortunately at the moment no such editor exists, however it is possible to create a table with a HTML editor (like Adobe Dreamweaver) and then copy the html code generated by this into the page.

It is possible in the future that a WYSIWYG editor will be adopted (there has been much discussion about this in the past, however there are many technical hurdles that need to be solved). For the more technically inclined/adventurous tools such as exist, however they do not incorporate the complete WYSIWYG experience and currently do not support tables (although they may do so in the future).

<doc id="300261" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=300261" title="Wikipedia:Advanced disambiguation issues">
Wikipedia:Advanced disambiguation issues

This essay, WP:Advanced disambiguation issues, describes extending Wikipedia's rules about of the overloaded or uncertain terms used when writing or finding article pages.

Many Wikipedia editors began pushing the initial focus, about disambiguation, as a problem of separating only titles which would have the same spelling, rather than similar spellings. The guidelines within the document began limiting not only the form, but also, the "substance" of what a disambiguation page would be allowed to list. The bias has been a severe focus on identical spellings, rather than handling similar spellings or pronunciations, etc.

In reality, people have many other concerns about ambiguous, or vague, concepts (not just identical titles):
Because of the rigidly enforced focus that Wikipedia's use of disambiguation is strictly about identical words, I have used the broader concept of "crosslink pages" that can connect to articles that have similar pronunciations, similar words, similar phrases, extra words beyond those specified, and similar images about those words. So then, crosslink pages are another type of "fork-page", used in Wikipedia to help selecting related articles.

The 2nd most common use of a title should also be linked in the 1st article's hat-note, not just "See zzz (disambiguation)".
Many people have been linking to the same-name titles by using a top hat-note linked to only one "recommended" page, so for article "zzz", the hat-note gives a link to only ""zzz (disambiguation)"". However, that is often a case of mass-linking to a disambiguation page, whereas target-linking to some specific page would often be quicker for the interested reader. Using the 80/20 rule, perhaps 80% of interest in a particular phrase or title is answered in 20% of articles sharing that title. For example, for the word "blanket", then over 80% of people want either a blanket bed-cover or Blanket Jackson (3rd child of Michael Jackson). Less than 20% of people are seeking some other meaning (of the word "blanket"). So, to avoid a mass-linking, instead, use target-linking of the most likely alternative titles:
In the weeks following the death of the singer, the pageviews for word "blanket" jumped very high and settled around 850 pageviews per day, which was 4x times higher than the prior average (in 2009) of 210 requests per day, asking for word "blanket". Obviously, the interest in Blanket Jackson then exceeded 75% of all interest in the word "blanket". As custody hearings and inheritance issues were predicted to last for years, there would be no quick return to the day when "Blanket" was mainly a bed-cover. Thus a target-link to ""Blanket Jackson"" allows over 75% of all readers to quickly access the article they most wanted, the person not the bed-cover.

In practice, the use of target-linking only requires editing of a small number of articles, because only the top 20% of articles will be read enough to bother changing their hat-note links. This a second occurrence of the 80-20 rule:
Thus target-linking can make Wikipedia (roughly) 5x faster to respond to user requests, and reduce total pageviews by a similar amount of about 80% less page-view traffic on Wikipedia for same-titles (which are becoming very common).

As Wikipedia expands to cover a vast range of topics, many more thousands of titles will require disambiguation, because so many new articles will be re-using those same titles. Many films use the same title as the book (which could be written after the film), and many books use a catchy common phrase as the book title, such as the books "Merger Mania" or "Star Quality". Hence, the use of target-linking in the top hat-notes of related articles will reduce the disambiguation-page viewing by about 80%, where users click on the other likely title in the hat-note suggestion.
Online dictionaries, for years, have been listing other choices when a user enters misspelled words. Rather than focus on only identical words, those dictionaries treat similar spellings as a need for disambiguation, rather than presume that a misspelled word is the same as some other correctly spelled word. Thus the word ""Tomatoe"" might generate a choice of similar words: tomatoes, tomatose, tometone, or Tomateo, etc.

<doc id="300265" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=300265" title="Independent sources">
Independent sources

The term "multiple independent sources" in journalism, criminal justice, science and general research, are two or more unconnected people, organizations, or objects which provide a given set of information or samples. For example, two separate people who see a traffic accident, at the spot, could be considered independent sources. However, if one person saw the accident and told the other one about it, then they would not be "independent", since one would "depend" on the other for their information. Also, if two witnesses to an event discuss what they saw before they are asked about it and agree to tell the same story, then they are also no longer independent. As another example, two scientific devices could be considered independent sources of measurement data, unless they shared the same wiring or electrical power supply (or similar factors).

Consulting multiple independent sources is a common technique for detecting errors and deception, as any divergences or contradictions between statements, or data samples, would likely indicate one of these.

Famously, the "New York Times' " minimal standard for reporting a fact not otherwise attributed to a single speaker is that it be verified by at least two independent sources.

Circular reporting is a situation where multiple sources "appear" to be independent, but in reality originate from a single source. Because circular reporting can happen inadvertently in many situations, extra care must be taken to ensure that multiple sources actually are independent, rather than interconnected in an obscure manner.

Little Walter

Little Walter, born as Marion Walter Jacobs, (*May 1, 1930 in in Marksville, Louisiana †February 15, 1968 in Chicago, Illinois) was an American blues harp player. He was very important for the development of playing harp. 
Jacobs was born in Marksville, Louisiana and grew up in Alexandria, Louisiana, where he first learned to play the harmonica. At the age of 12 he left school and travelled around. He played in the streets of New Orleans, Memphis, Helena, Arkansas and St. Louis and made his living. He learned more about playing harp from Sonny Boy Williamson II, Sunnyland Slim, Honeyboy Edwards and others.

1945 he went to Chicago. There he made first recordings playing guitar for Floyd Jones. Frustrated about the fact that guitars were louder than his harmonica he started using a microphon and pluging it into the guitar amplifiers. So he could compet with any guitar sound. 1947 he did his first recordings for a small label in Chicago. 1948 he became member of Muddy Waters band and recorded with him for Chess records. First he played acoustic, the first appearance on record of Little Walter's amplified harmonica sound was on Muddy's "Country Boy"/"Too Young To Know" (Chess 1452), recorded on July 11, 1951. 

His first hit record was "Juke", an instrumental, which was intended to be the signature song of Muddy Waters band. The song was published on Checkers, a sub label of Chess. It stayed 20 weeks in the charts, eight of them on #1. Till 1957 he played with Muddy Waters but in this year he was replaced by Junior Wells. Walter took his band "The Aces" and renamed them into "The Jukes". Walter had a lot of hits, f.e. "My Babe" written by Willie Dixon, but with the beginning of the 1960s his sucess faded away.

1964 and 1967 he came with the American Folk Blues Festival to Europe. After his second tour he was involved in a fight during a concert break. Although he was not severly injured he died in the night due to an heart failure. He was buried on February 22, 1968 at St. Mary's Cemetery in Evergreen Park, IL on February 22, 1968.

His influence can be heard in every modern blues harp player , from blues greats such as Junior Wells, James Cotton, George "Harmonica" Smith, Carey Bell, and Big Walter Horton, through modern-day masters Sugar Blue, Billy Branch, Kim Wilson, Rod Piazza, William Clarke, and Charlie Musselwhite, in blues-rock crossover artists such as Paul Butterfield, Southside Johnny (who named his band The Asbury Jukes after Little Walter's band), and John Popper of the band Blues Traveler.

Little Walter made 15 singles that reached the Billboard R&B chart.

The barycenter (or barycentre; from the Greek "βαρύκεντρον") is the point between two objects where they balance each other. For example, it is the center of mass where two or more planets orbit each other. When a moon orbits a planet, or a planet orbits a star, both bodies are actually orbiting around a point that lies outside the center of the larger body. For example, the moon does not orbit the exact center of the Earth. It actually orbits a point on a line between the center of the Earth and the Moon. This is about 1,710 km below the surface of the Earth. This is the point where the mass of the moon and the mass of the Earth balance. This is the point about which the Earth and Moon orbit as they travel around the Sun.

Estelle Yancey

Estelle "Mama" Yancey (January 1, 1896–April 19, 1986) was an American blues singer. She was the wife of pianist Jimmy Yancey and recorded often together with her husband.

Yancey, born Estelle Harris, grew up in Chicago, where she sang in church choirs and learned how to play the guitar. In 1917, when she was 21, she married Jimmy Yancey. She often sang with him at meetings and house parties in the 1930s and 1940s and performed with him at Carnegie Hall, New York in 1948. Because Jimmy Yancey was a great boogie-woogie/blues piano player, but a poor singer, Estelle recorded frequently with her husband. In 1943, the Yanceys recorded for Session Records, and went back into the studio to record the album "Pure Blues" for Atlantic Records. The session was just a few months before Jimmy Yancey's death that same year. 

Estelle continued to perform and record. Mama Yancey's recordings with other pianists include "South Side Blues" for the Riverside label (1961), some records with Art Hodes for Verve Records in 1965, and "Maybe I'll Cry" with Erwin Helfer for the Red Beans label in 1983, recorded at age 87. 

Estelle Yancey died April 19, 1986 in Chicago, Illinois.

They are part of Japanese seasonal traditions and are often given as gifts at these times. Originally, a big leaf and an animal hair were used as uchiwa. The purpose is to purify and pray. Over time they have changed, and are now made from bamboo and paper. There are many kinds of pattern; during the Han Dynasty they were often decorated by famous calligraphers. During the Edo period they were made as souvenirs for shrines. During the Meiji period they got high evaluation and imported foreign countries.

Most oldest uchiwa can be seen in the recording of ancient China, the wall painting of Ancient Egypt. Middle Ages, uchiwa is used as a tool of the state in the people. The end of Kōan (Muromachi period) period, uchiwa made from bamboo and paper. 

General function is to fan cooking and to keep cool. Some people use to purity disease.

<doc id="300421" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=300421" title="Secret sharing">
Secret sharing

Secret sharing is used as a term to refer to ways of sharing a secret among many people. Each person knows part of the secret that is shared, but a number of people need to cooperate to rebuild the secret. The knowledge of one person alone is not enough to reconstruct the secret. Adi Shamir and George Blakley developed the method independently of each other, in 1979.

One example where secret sharing is used is the RSA crytosystem. It uses a "secret key". If this key is distributed among many people, no single person can make a signature. Even if the part of one person is revealed or lost, a number of them can still make a signature. This is often used is areas where security is very important, such as banks, or the military.

The dealer hands each player their part of the secret. In an easier setup, the parts of the players can be combined to form the secret, but with each part there is extra information. Say that a secret needs five parts, and three parts are known. In this setup, guessing the two parts that are missing will be easier than guessing the secret awhen no parts are known. The other setup is said to be secure from the point of view of information theory, because knowing part of the required number of player parts will not change how difficult it is to guess the secret. 

There are different methods of secure secret sharing techniques

In this method, any t out of the n shares may be used to recover the secret. The idea is that a polynomial of degree t-1 is defined by t points on the polynomial: It takes two points to define a straight line, three to define a quadratic curve, four for a cubic, and so on. It takes t points ot define a polynomial of degree t-1. That way it is possible to build a polynomial, the first ocefficient is the secret; there are n randomly picked coefficients. Each player receives one of the n coefficients. If there are at least t players, they can rebuild the original curve, and get the secret.

<doc id="300422" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=300422" title="Zero-knowledge proof">
Zero-knowledge proof

A Zero-knowledge proof or Zero-knowledge protocol is a protocol used in cryptography. In such a protocol, two parties are communicating. The task of one party is to convince the other that it knows some secret, but without revealing the secret. An real-world example of such a protocol is the Feige-Fiat-Shamir Identification Scheme.

There is a well-known story presenting some of the ideas of zero-knowledge proofs, first published by Jean-Jacques Quisquater and others in their paper "How to Explain Zero-Knowledge Protocols to Your Children". It is common practice to label the two parties in a zero-knowledge proof as Peggy (the prover of the statement) and Victor (the verifier of the statement).

In this story, Peggy has uncovered the secret word used to open a magic door in a cave. The cave is shaped like a circle, with the entrance on one side and the magic door blocking the opposite side. Victor says he'll pay her for the secret, but not until he's sure that she really knows it. Peggy says she'll tell him the secret, but not until she receives the money. They devise a scheme by which Peggy can prove that she knows the word without telling it to Victor.

First, Victor waits outside the cave as Peggy goes in. They label the left and right paths from the entrance A and B. Peggy randomly takes either path A or B. Then, Victor enters the cave and shouts the name of the path he wants her to use to return, either A or B, chosen at random. Providing she really does know the magic word, this is easy: she opens the door, if necessary, and returns along the desired path. Note that Victor does not know which path she has gone down.

However, suppose she did not know the word. Then, she would only be able to return by the named path if Victor were to give the name of the same path that she had entered by. Since Victor would choose A or B at random, he would have a 50% chance of guessing correctly. If they were to repeat this trick many times, say 20 times in a row, her chance of successfully anticipating all of Victor's requests would become very small. 

For this reason, if Peggy reliably appears at the exit Victor names, he can conclude that she is very likely to know the secret word.

Capacitance Electronic Disc

The Capacitance Electronic Disc (also know as a CED) was a type of video disc. It was made in 1964 by the company RCA. The CED is similar to a record because it stores the video and sound as small groves on a black disk. Because of this, the CED is an analog disc format instead of a digital format like a CD. The CED is stored inside a plastic case so you can not touch the disk as it is very easy to damage. On the plastic case is a label that has the name of the Movie on the disc as well as other information such as a summary of the movie.

The first CED was made in 1964 but were not available for purchase until 1981. About 200 movies were made available on CED. Each movie that was on CED was about $15 to $35 depending on the length of the movie. The CED did not sell well, this is because you could not record on the disc like you could with a video tape. The production of the CED stopped in 1986.

CEDs are conductive vinyl platters that are 30.0 cm (11.8 in) in diameter. To avoid using the metric system to name their discs, they were called "12 inch discs" even though they were actually slightly smaller. Each side of the disc has grooves that are about 19 miles long and are 37 times smaller than the grooves on a regular phonograpg record. When the disc is playing, it spins at about 450 times per minute and each rotation of the disc contained several frames of audio and visual information. 

To read the disc, a titanium needle was placed very lightly on the outer edge of the disc. A small electric current was then passed thru the center of the needle, where it would touch the bottem of the groove and read the audio information, which was stored in small holes. The needle would read these by detecting how much air was between the needle and the pit and then the electronics of the player would convert these into audio. The visual information was stored in the grooves and were read like a regular phonograph record. As the needle passed over the grooves, it would vibrate and the player would convert the vibrations into the pictures.

The winner was pole vaulter Bob Seagren. The BBC covered the competition and aired their own programme on December 31, 1973. The BBC version featured British athletes.

Competitors usually participate in ten different sporting events, including a 100 yard dash, run, obstacle course, weightlifting, bowling, rowing, tennis, basketball, bicycle racing, and swimming. Sometimes the sports have changed over time and between the European and American competitions. For example, in the first USA competition, there was no obstacle course, but there was table tennis and baseball. Athletes get points for the position they finish in each event. The competitor with the most points at the end of all ten events is the winner.

Krasnodar

Krasnodar () is a city in Southern Russia on the Kuban River, located around northeast of the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk.

It is the administrative center of Krasnodar Krai (also known as Kuban). Population: 

The city was founded on January 12, 1794 (Gregorian calendar) as Yekaterinodar (). The original name meant "Catherine's Gift" simultaneously in recognition of Catherine the Great's grant of land in the Kuban region to the Black Sea Cossacks (later the Kuban Cossacks) and in recognition of Saint Catherine, "the Martyr", who is considered to be the patron of the city. After the October Revolution, Yekaterinodar was renamed Krasnodar (December 1920). There are two potential meanings for the new name of the city: Krasno- (Красно-), meaning either 'beautiful' (an older root) or 'red' (especially relevant considering the political atmosphere of the time); and -dar (-дар), meaning 'gift'. Thus, the city's name means either "beautiful gift" or "red gift" (i.e. 'gift of the reds')..

The origin of the city starts with a fortress built by the Cossacks in order to defend imperial borders and claim Russian ownership over Circassia, which was contested by Ottoman Turkey. In the first half of the 19th century Yekaterinodar grew into a busy center of the Kuban Cossacks. It was granted town status in 1867. By 1888 about 45,000 people lived in the city and it became a vital trade center of southern Russia. In 1897, an obelisk commemorating 200 year old history of Kuban Cossack Host was built in Yekaterinodar.

During the Russian Civil War the city changed hands several times between the Red Army and Volunteer Army, many Kuban Cossacks were committed anti-Bolsheviks who supported the White Movement.

During the Great Patriotic War (World War II), Krasnodar was occupied by the German Army between August 12, 1942 and February 12, 1943. The city sustained heavy damage in the fighting but was rebuilt and renovated after the war.

In the summer of 1943, the Soviets began trials, including of their own citizens, for collusion with the Nazis and participation in war crimes. The first such trial was held at Krasnodar on July 14–17, 1943. This was the first public trial of the mass murder of Jews during the Holocaust. The Krasnodar tribunal pronounced eight death sentences, which were summarily conducted in the city square in front of a crowd of about thirty thousand people.

Famous Russian soprano Anna Netrebko, soprano Evgenia Kononova, cosmonaut Gennady Padalka, counterrevolutionary Andrei Shkuro and rhythmic gymnast Inna Zhukova were born in Krasnodar. Another notable native of Krasnodar is Greece basketball international Lazaros Papadopoulos, who emigrated to Greece with his Pontic Greek parents when he was 10 years old.

Krasnodar is home to the steel lattice hyperboloid tower built by the Russian engineer and scientist Vladimir Grigorievich Shukhov in 1928; it is located near Krasnodar Circus.

Other attractions include St. Catherine's Cathedral, the State Arts Museum, a park and theatre named after Maxim Gorky, the beautiful concert hall of the Krasnodar Philharmonic Society, which is considered to have some of the best acoustics in southern Russia, State Cossack Choir and the Krasnodar circus

The most interesting place of Krasnodar is Krasnaya Street (which translates as "Red, Beautiful Street"). There are situated many sights of Krasnodar. In the beginning of this street one can see the Central Concert Hall; at the other end one can see the Avrora cinemacenter. A "Triumphal Arch" is situated in the middle of Krasnaya Street.

The main airline is Kuban Airlines (at Krasnodar International Airport), and the largest hotels in the city include the Intourist, Hotel Moskva, and Hotel Platan. Krasnodar uses a 220 V/50 Hz power supply with two round-pin outlets, like most European countries.

Public transportation within Krasnodar consists of city buses, trolleybuses, trams, and marshrutkas. Trolleybuses and trams, both powered by overhead electric wires, are the main form of transportation in Krasnodar. Unlike Moscow and Saint Petersburg, Krasnodar does not have a metro system.

The coat of arms of Yekaterinodar was introduced in 1841 by the Cossack yesaul Ivan Chernik. The royal letter "E" in the middle is for Ekaterina II (Russian for Catherine II). It also depicts the date city was founded, the Imperial double headed eagle (symbolizing Tsar's patronage of Black Sea Cossacks), a bulawa of a Cossack ataman, Yekaterinodar fortress, and flags with letters "E", "P", "A", and "N" standing for Catherine II, Paul I, Alexander I and Nicholas I. Yellow stars around the shield symbolized 59 Black Sea stanitsas around the city.

Krasnodar has five sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International, Inc. (SCI):

Periodic comet

A periodic comet is a comet which orbits around the Sun. A short-period comet will complete its orbit in less than 200 years. A long-period comet will take more than 200 years to orbit. In most cases the comets are named after the person who first discovered them. The Shoemaker-Levy comets were named after Eugene Shoemaker, Carolyn Shoemaker and David Levy. A few comets are named after the person who calculated the orbits, such as 2P/Encke and 27P/Crommelin. It is very difficult to work out the orbit of a long-period comet because of the effect of planets, or the release of gas or material from the comet itself. Short-period comets can be predicted with a lot of accuracy.

Periodic comets sometimes have the same name, for example there are nine Shoemaker-Levy comets and twenty-four NEAT comets. The Minor Planet Center, a part of the International Astronomical Union gives comets a different number prefix or uses the full title such as 181P/Shoemaker-Levy and 192/Shoemaker-Levy which are both "Comet Shoemaker-Levy". Sometimes an informal numbering system is used for periodic comets so 181P is Comet Shoemaker-Levy 6 and 192P is Comet Shoemaker-Levy 1. Because non-periodic Shoemaker-Levy comets are included in the number sequences there appear to be gaps in the numbers, for example C/1991 B1 is between Shoemaker-Levy 2 and 3, C/1991 T2 is between 5 and 6, C/1993 K1 and C/1994 E2 after Shoemaker-Levy 9.

In naming a comet, the letter before the "/" is:

Some lists keep the "C" prefix for comets of with orbits longer than about 30 years until their return is confirmed.

<doc id="300498" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=300498" title="Tommy Mottola">
Tommy Mottola

Thomas Daniel "Tommy" Mottola (born July 14, 1949) is an American music executive, co-owner of Casablanca Records in a joint venture with the Universal Music Group. He is the ex-husband of Mariah Carey, and is married to Mexican singer Thalía. He headed Sony Music Entertainment, parent of the Columbia label, for nearly 15 years.

Apart from his experience in managing music outfits, Mottola is known as a mentor and former talent manager. His most famous proteges were Hall & Oates, Carly Simon, John Mellencamp, Diana Ross, and Taylor Dayne in the 80s, Mariah Carey (his second wife) in the 1990s, Gloria Estefan , Jessica Simpson and Jennifer Lopez in the early 2000s.

Mottola was born in The Bronx, New York. He graduated from Iona Grammar School in 1962 and Iona Preparatory School in New Rochelle, New York in 1966. He briefly attended Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York before dropping out. He initially had aspirations of a music career, and released with CBS Records, but his singing career was short-lived.

Wishing to stay in the industry, Mottola started Champion Entertainment Organization Inc. to manage other artists. While working at the Chappell music-publishing company, he became the mentor to Philadelphia-based soul/rock performers Daryl Hall and John Oates.

His belief in the duo led him to push them relentlessly to do appearances and advertising promotions, including some of the first specialized music videos and one of the first modern "sponsored tours," for Beech-Nut's Care Free Gum, Panasonic, and Pontiac..

Hall & Oates paid tribute to him in their track "Gino (the Manager)" on their self-titled 1975 RCA release, better known as the Silver Album. Mottola also figured—this time, being mentioned by name—in "Cherchez La Femme," the 1976 dance hit by another Mottola act, Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band. ("Tommy Mottola / Lives on the road ...")

Raised as a Roman Catholic, Mottola converted to Judaism shortly before his marriage to Lisa Clark. That marriage, which ended in divorce in 1992, produced a daughter (Sarah) and a son (Michael, who is now a production assistant with MTV).

Brisbane rock band Regurgitator wrote a tribute song to him called "I Love Tommy Mottola" for their 1999 album "...Art".

In 1987, Mottola was chosen to run CBS Records at the age of 37.

Soon afterward, Sony Corporation closed on its deal to buy the CBS Records group unit from CBS, naming him President and CEO of the music division, where he succeeded his former mentor Walter Yetnikoff, who had originally brought Mottola into CBS. Mottola served as Chairman and CEO Sony Music Entertainment.

During his tenure, he transformed Sony into one of the most successful global music companies, expanding its businesses into over 60 countries, while creating one of the strongest management teams in the industry. He revitalized Sony Music's publishing division by making such acquisitions as the Beatles catalogue and enabled Sony to become the first major music company to make available commercial digital downloads. He is widely well-known for signing, developing, and nurturing the careers of Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Destiny's Child, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, Gloria Estefan, the Dixie Chicks, Marc Anthony, Barbra Streisand, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, among others. He also worked with Michael Jackson from the time he began recording his "Dangerous" (1991) album. Jackson would later state that his relationship with Mottola dissolved based on corruption in his working practices, publicly referring to him as a "racist" and "devil". "The recording companies really, really do conspire against the artists." Jackson said.(source: Vh1)

In 1988, Brenda K. Starr, a Columbia artist, handed Mottola a demo tape from one of her backup singers. Initially he tossed it aside, but later decided to listen to it. He was impressed by the demo and tracked down the singer, a then-unknown Mariah Carey, and eventually signed her. Mottola is seen as the main architect for Mariah's success in the early years of her career.

In June 1993, Mottola and Carey married in a lavish ceremony, but the marriage was short-lived with the couple separating shortly before Christmas 1996 and divorcing in early 1998. In 2000, Carey, at the time Columbia's biggest selling artist, signed an $80 million contract with Virgin Records, but after the commercial and critical failure of her first album for the label, "the Glitter soundtrack", Virgin dropped her from the company and it rescinded the $80 million contract. Carey later signed with Island Records.

Mottola later went on to date other stars before dating Mexican singer Thalía, whom he married December 2, 2000. They have a daughter together, Sabrina Sakaë (Oct 7, 2007). Their second child, a son, Matteo Alejandro was born on June 25th 2011 . He also is credited with creating the Latin Explosion in popular music by championing such Sony artists as Marc Anthony, Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez and Gloria Estefan. Additionally, Mottola was the architect for some of Sony's biggest global brands such as Celine Dion and Mariah Carey. During his 15 year tenure, Mottola built Sony up from a company with revenues of 800 million dollars a year to one with over 6 billion dollars of annual revenue by the year 2000.
In June 2010, he decided to sell his Ranch in Colorado, for an amount of 27.5 million dollars, as he was not spending time in it anymore and wanted to be closer to his family

Tommy Mottola was the head of Sony Music Entertainment until January 2003. Since leaving his post as chief of Sony Music, Mottola has been building a new entertainment company, complete with recorded music, television production, theater, and fashion, alongside a branding and management company launching. He was instrumental in re-launching the various careers of such artists as Grammy winner and Latin pop star Marc Anthony, and teen sensation Lindsay Lohan. Later signings included Cassie Ventura in 2006 and Mika, who in 2007 had a #1 single in the UK.

A collaboration with former Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein has them teamed on two current projects for live theater, namely producers of Pink Floyd's "The Wall". Mottola's TV production arm is currently producing and developing many shows for cable and network television.

Mottola bought out the rights to Casablanca Records (a then-diminished imprint of Polygram), and resurrected it, signing actress Lindsay Lohan, and singer Mika.

Known also for his many philanthropic activities, Mottola has served on the Board of Directors of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Police Athletic League of New York City, T.J. Martell Foundation for Cancer, Leukemia and AIDS Research, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation and Museum, and the Federal Law Enforcement Foundation.

The character of Gene Balboa in the Channel 101 Internet TV Series Yacht Rock is loosely based on Mottola, in particular his time as manager of Hall and Oates.

The Australian band Regurgitator include the song "i love tommy mottola" on their 1999 album "...art".

Wikipedia:BLP policy advises fix over delete

This essay, WP:BLP policy advises fix over delete, explains how the long-term policy """" (WP:BLP) states that material should be improved/mended and fixed first, rather than delete an article page quickly, to correct BLP-issues. The text of policy has stated since (March 2008), ""Page deletion is normally a last resort"."

Policy has stated since 2008 (under subheader "Deletion"): 

The policy continues (in the same section titled "Deletion"):

The conditions for re-writing the article text include: unsourced negative material; disparaging; or written non-neutrally. Removal of text is only when those issues cannot readily be repaired or replaced to an acceptable standard.

Wikipedia is the root source of many mirror-copy websites, which copy partial or whole article pages. When an article page is deleted, some Internet search engines (including Google and Bing.com) might still retain their prior index information, as copied from prior revisions. Then, because the article has been deleted, no automatic updates can be made to those search-engine copies. As a consequence, the article goes "viral" as being spread by uncontrolled copies, no longer kept current with a latest revision maintained by Wikipedia editors. Often, it would be preferable, first, to revise an article to have suitable contents (as directed by policy ), then let it be re-indexed into those search-engines, and then if necessary, delete the article after the improved contents have been copied into those cache-pages of the search-engines. Let an acceptable copy go viral, but not a bad version of the page.

Note: because Bing.com (or possibly Google Search) is structured as a "decision engine" (within a knowledge-based system), the page contents are not always mere text copies, but rather can be re-structured into special databases using knowledge engineering. Those re-structured contents can be reformatted to appear in multiple, various pages, such as with the sub-header links on some Bing.com match entries.

The problem of viral copies occurs in many situations, not just for sensitive or libelous BLP articles. A similar situation occurs when a page is moved/renamed, while containing improper information. A search-engine index is likely to contain both versions, one frozen as the old title (for weeks/months) and also the other, kept current under the new page title. In general, fix a page first, delay by leaving a few days, then after re-indexing in search-engines, move or delete. This delay in activities might require protection to deter improper editing during the time period.

In summary, as noted in Wikipedia policy , articles should first be improved or repaired, rather than deleted, if those articles contain sensitive personal material about living persons, particularly if it is negative. Page deletion is normally a last resort.

Bayeux Tapestry

The Bayeux Tapestry is a long embroidered cloth – not an actual tapestry – which depicts the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England as well as the events of the invasion itself. The tapestry is annotated in Latin. It is exhibited in a special museum in Bayeux, Normandy called "Musée de la Tapisserie de Bayeux".

The tapestry tells the story of the Norman conquest of England. The two combatants are the Anglo-Saxon English, led by Harold Godwinson, recently crowned as King of England, and the Normans, led by William the Conqueror.

The tapestry is regarded as one of the greatest examples of Anglo-Saxon art, because, though ordered by a Norman, it was made by English (Anglo-Saxon) artisans. It is also extremely important as a historical document.

In common with other embroidered hangings of the early medieval period, this piece is conventionally referred to as a "tapestry", although it is not a true tapestry in which the design is woven into the cloth; it is in fact an embroidery.

The Bayeux tapestry is embroidered in wool yarn on a tabby-woven linen ground using two methods of stitching: outline or stem stitch for lettering and the outlines of figures, and couching or laid work for filling in figures. The linen is assembled in panels and has been patched in numerous places.

The main yarn colours are terracotta or russet, blue-green, dull gold, olive green, and blue, with small amounts of dark blue or black and sage green.

<doc id="300513" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=300513" title="Anglo-Saxon Chronicle">
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is a collection of annals in Old English chronicling the history of the Anglo-Saxons. The annals were initially created late in the 9th century, probably in Wessex, during the reign of Alfred the Great. Multiple manuscript copies were made and distributed to monasteries across England and were independently updated. In one case, the chronicle was still being actively updated in 1154.

Nine manuscripts survive in whole or in part, though not all are of equal historical value and none of them is the original version. The oldest seems to have been started towards the end of Alfred's reign, while the most recent was written at Peterborough Abbey after a fire at that monastery in 1116. 

Almost all of the material in the chronicle is in the form of annals, by year; the earliest are dated at 60 BC, and historical material follows up to the year in which the chronicle was written, at which point contemporary records begin. These manuscripts collectively are known as the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle".

The Chronicle is not unbiased: there are occasions when comparison with other medieval sources makes it clear that the scribes who wrote it omitted events or told one-sided versions of stories; there are also places where the different versions contradict each other. 

Taken as a whole the Chronicle is the single most important historical source for the period in England between the end of Roman rule in Britain and the decades following the Norman Conquest. Much of the information given in the Chronicle is not recorded elsewhere. In addition, the manuscripts are important sources for the history of the English language; in particular, the later Peterborough Chronicle is one of the earliest examples of Middle English in existence.

Seven of the nine surviving manuscripts and fragments now reside in the British Library. The remaining two are in the Bodleian Library at Oxford and the Parker Library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.

Sutton Hoo is the site of two Anglo-Saxon cemeteries dating to the 6th and early 7th centuries CE that is located near Woodbridge, Suffolk, England. One contained an undisturbed ship burial including a wealth of Anglo-Saxon artefacts of outstanding art-historical and archaeological significance, which are now held in the British Museum in London. Other sites had produced significant finds, but had previously been looted.

The ship-burial, probably dating from the early 7th century and excavated in 1939, is one of the most magnificent archaeological finds in England for its size and completeness, its meaning, the quality and beauty of its contents, and for the profound interest of the burial ritual itself.

George Gawler

Lieutenant-Colonel George Gawler, KH, (21 July 1795 – 7 May 1869) was the second governor of South Australia; from 17 October 1838 until 15 May 1841.

Gawler was the only child of Captain Samuel Gawler and his wife Julia, née Russell. 
Gawler's father was a captain in the 73rd Regiment of Foot, and he was killed in Mysore, India in December 1804. The Gawler family came from Devon. George Gawler was educated by a private teacher, then at a school in Cold Bath, Islington. He spent two years at the military college in Great Marlow.

In October 1810 Gawler joined 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot as an ensign and in January 1812 he went to the Peninsular War. At Badajoz, Gawler was wounded during a charge, but he was saved from death by a soldier who lost his own life. He was in Spain until 1814, taking part in the advance on Madrid. The regiment returned to England and Gawler fought at the Battle of Waterloo as a lieutenant. He remained in France with the army of occupation until 1818, and in 1820 married Maria Cox of Derby who was the niece of Samuel Richardson. Gawler's new sister-in-law Mary Ann married William Leeke, a fellow officer from the 52nd. Gawler and his wife were sincerely religious. When the 52nd was sent to New Brunswick in 1823 they did much social and religious work. Gawler returned to England in 1826, and from 1830 to 1832 he was engaged in recruiting. He reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1834, and in 1837 received the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order (KH), third class.

In 1838 Gawler was appointed governor of South Australia. His predecessor was Captain John Hindmarsh. Gawley and his wife and children arrived on the Pestonjee Bomanjee on 12 October 1838. They had made a four month journey via Tenerife and Rio de Janeiro. Gawler found that the colony lacked public finances, and poor officials and 4000 immigrants were living in mean houses. He was allowed a maximum of £12,000 expenditure a year, with an additional £5,000 credit for emergencies. His first goal was to accelerate rural settlement and primary production. He persuaded Charles Sturt to come from New South Wales for surveying, because Colonel William Light who had performed the role resigned due to bad health. Gawler appointed more colonial officials, set up a police force, took part in exploration, and improved the facilities at Port Adelaide during his administration. The first permanent Government House was built and this is now the East Wing of the present building.

In 1840, droughts in other Australian colonies increased the cost of living rapidly because South Australia had not been self-sufficient for food yet. Gawler increased public expenditure but eventually the economy broke and the management policy of the colony was forced to change. Over £200,000 had been spent and the land fund in London had been exhausted. A £155,000 loan was approved by the British Parliament (later made a gift) and Captain George Grey was sent to replace Gawler.

Governor Gawler had managed to make South Australia self-sufficient in terms of agriculture and had restored public confidence. Gawler was a resolute and energetic officer. When he found the settlers faced with disaster, he judged at once what it was necessary to do, and saved the colony. However, Gawler's work was long misjudged, largely because his successor Grey unfairly criticised Gawler. 
Richard Charles Mills insists in his "Colonization of Australia" that Gawler had been guilty of carelessness and wastefulness, and deserves blame. But at the same time Mills admitted that Gawler was facing extraordinary difficulties. 
Charles Sturt and other men at the time generally agreed that his administration had greatly benefited the settlement, and the select committee on South Australia reported that the critics of his expenditure were "unable to point out any specific item by which it could have been considerably reduced without great public inconvenience". Later investigations show that Gawler was surely one of founders of South Australia.

In 1845, Gawler wrote a book in which he suggested that Jews be allowed to establish Jewish agricultural settlements in the Land of Israel as compensation for their suffering in Europe and under Turkish rule. In 1849 he toured Israel with Moses Montefiore. In 1852, he established an association for the colonization of Palestine. Gawler died in Southsea and was buried in Portsmouth. 

The town of Gawler was named after him, as it was surveyed soon after he arrived. The Gawler Ranges at the north end of Eyre Peninsula are also named after him. Derby's Town and County Museum in the 1830's included Gawler in its list of principal benefactors. Gawler had contributed a collection of minerals and exotic stuffed birds which included an albatross from his time as governor.

Wikipedia:Blanking sections violates many policies

This essay, WP:Blanking sections violates many policies is an explanation of why article sections should be discussed, beforehand, with the original author(s), before being removed (or totally rewritten) on a page. Beyond blanking of the text, the total rewrite of a section, is a similar removal of text. Think of the notion (of deleting an article section) as similar to going to another employee's work area or desk, then grabbing items to throw away. Even if they don't own those items, they are typically answerable for why those items are missing.

There are several policies which reject the wholesale blanking of sections from within an article page. Hence, consider the action of deleting an article section to be a potential severe violation of more than 9 Wikipedia policies or guidelines.










Article sections which require special discussion, before rewording/deletion, should be more than 20 words in length. To avoid any attempts to use a dummy section, in claiming protection for a rogue sentence, it is necessary to identify a minimum size for a section, as being a good-faith effort to provide broad coverage in the section. This exemption for size is just as a sanity check, and a user could still create a larger section to foster rogue ideas, but that notion, of deliberately creating invalid text as a separate section, cannot be determined without a wider discussion with other users.

The focus is to discuss the potential deletion or rewriting of an entire section, rather than the editing of a few phrases scattered in an article.

Rare emergencies: There are several policies which support the removal of sections and other content, in rare cases. The discusses the various circumstances where content can and sometimes should be removed if it can't be improved. Among the other policies which support the removal of content in some circumstances are , , , and the core policies of , , and .

Steven Levy

Steven Levy (born 1951) is an American journalist who has written several books on computers, technology, cryptography, the Internet, cybersecurity, and privacy.

In 1984 Levy established the 7 commandments of the Personal Computer revolution. It was the base for the Personal Computer and Internet social ethos:

1. Access to Computers - and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total.

2. Always yield to the Hands-on Imperative.

3. All information should be free.

4. Mistrust authority - promote decentralization.

5. Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race,or position.

6. You can create art and beauty on a computer.

7. Computers can change your life for the better.

Levy is a senior writer for "Wired". Previously, he was chief technology writer and a senior editor for "Newsweek". Levy has had articles published in "Harper's", "Macworld", "The New York Times Magazine", "The New Yorker", "Premiere", and "Rolling Stone". He is regarded (along with Walter Mossberg) as a prominent and respected critic of Apple Inc.. In July 2004, Levy wrote a cover story (which also featured an interview with Apple CEO Steve Jobs) which unveiled the 4th generation of the iPod to the world before Apple had officially done so, an unusual event since Apple is well known for its tight-lipped press policy.

Levy has won several awards, including the "Computer Press Association Award" for a report he co-wrote in 1998 on the Year 2000 problem.

In 1978, Steven Levy rediscovered Albert Einstein's brain in the office of the pathologist who removed and preserved it. 

In 1984, he wrote a book called "", in which he described a “hacker ethic”, which became a guideline to understanding how computers have advanced into the machines that we know and use today. He identified this Hacker Ethic to consist of key points such as that all information is free, and that this information should be used to “change life for the better”.

Levy received his bachelor's degree from Temple University and earned a Master's degree in literature from Pennsylvania State University. He lives in New York City with his wife, Pulitzer Prize winner Teresa Carpenter, and son.

Meade Lux Lewis (*September 4, 1905 in Chicago – June 7, 1964 in Minneapolis) was an American blues, jazz and boogie woogie pianist. Together with Pete Johnson and Albert Ammons he made boogie woogie popular.
Lewis was born Meade Anderson Lewis in Chicago, Illinois . He started playing the piano not until his 18th year.In his youth he was influenced by the pianist Jimmy Yancey.

His first recording was "Honky Tonk Train Blues" for Paramount in 1927. The title was influenced by his youth where a railway run beside his home. The record was not very sucessful, so he washed cars to make a living. He rerecorded it for other labels in 1935 and 1937. Nearly each boogie pianist has recorded this title(f.e.Jean-Paul Amouroux, Keith Emerson, Jay McShann, Lloyd Glenn, Jörg Hegemann, Gene Phillips, Michael Pewny, Gene Taylor, Tim Wheals und Axel Zwingenberger). 1935 he was found by John Hammond and started a new career. In 1938 he played together with Pete Johnson and Albert Ammons in John Hammonds famous From Spirituals to Swing concert at Carnegie Hall. After this the pianists often played together at Café Society and toured together. In 1941 he went to Los Angeles. 

Lewis was the first pianist who played on the celeste and the harpsichord in jazz and boogie records. In his later years he was uncomfortable with his fame as jazz and boogie pianist, so he played ragtime and pop songs. He did recordings till 1962 but at this time he was already forgotten. He died on June 7th, 1964 in a car accident in Minneapolis.

This three compilation albums from Classics give a good overview over Lewis´work.

Atlantic Wall

The Atlantic Wall (German: "Atlantikwall") was an extensive system of Coastal fortifications built by Nazi Germany between 1942 and 1944 along the western coast of Europe as a defense against an anticipated Allied invasion of the mainland continent from Great Britain. 

On March 23, 1942 Führer Directive Number 40 called for the official creation of the Atlantic Wall. After the St. Nazaire Raid, on April 13, 1942 Adolf Hitler ordered naval and submarine bases to be heavily defended. Fortifications remained concentrated around ports until late in 1943 when defences were increased in other areas.

Organisation Todt, which had designed the Siegfried Line ("Westwall") along the Franco-German border, was the chief engineering group responsible for the design and construction of the wall's major fortifications. Thousands of forced laborers were impressed to construct these permanent fortifications along the Dutch, Belgian and French coasts facing the English Channel.

Early in 1944, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was assigned to improve the Wall's defences. Rommel believed the existing coastal fortifications were entirely inadequate and he immediately began strengthening them. Under his direction, a string of reinforced concrete pillboxes were built along the beaches, or sometimes slightly inland, to house machine guns, antitank guns, and light artillery. Mines and antitank obstacles were planted on the beaches themselves, and underwater obstacles and mines were placed in waters just off shore. The intent was to destroy the Allied landing craft before they could unload.

By the time of the invasion, the Germans had laid almost six million mines in northern France. More gun emplacements and minefields extended inland, along roads leading away from the beaches. In likely landing spots for gliders and parachutists, the Germans emplaced slanted poles with sharpened tops, which the troops called "Rommelspargel" ("Rommel's asparagus"). Low-lying river and estuarine areas were permanently flooded, as well.

Rommel firmly believed that Germany would inevitably be defeated unless the invasion could be stopped at the beach.

Although the defensive wall was never completed the Wall's existence has served to explain away concerns of the Soviet Union for why the Second Front was not opened until June 6, 1944 (less than a year before the end of the war). The Wall primarily consisted of batteries, bunkers, and minefields, which during 1942–1944, stretched from the French-Spanish border to Norway (Festung Norwegen). Many bunkers still exist, for example near Scheveningen, Den Haag, Katwijk and in Normandy. In Oostende, Belgium the public may visit a well-preserved part of the defences. That section consists of emplacements of the "Saltzwedel neu battery" and the "Stützpunkt Bensberg", consisting of several men’s quarters and the necessary facilities. These constructions were used by a unit of German military engineers ("Pionierstab") who were in charge of bunker construction. 

The Channel Islands were heavily fortified, particularly the island of Alderney which is closest to France. Hitler had decreed that 10% of the steel and concrete used in the Atlantic Wall go to the Channel Islands, because of the propaganda value of controlling British territory. Despite the mooting of Operation Constellation "et al.", the Allies bypassed the islands and did not try to liberate them when they invaded Normandy. The islands' German garrisons did not surrender until 9 May 1945 – one day after the German armed forces on the mainland. The German garrison on Alderney did not surrender until 16 May. 

Walcheren Island was considered to be the "strongest concentration of defences the Nazis had ever constructed."

The Atlantic Wall was not a single organisation except in the administration of its building. Militarily it was divided into eight commands:

Many major ports and positions were made part of the Atlantic wall and received heavy fortifications, Hitler ordered them all to fight to the end and some of them remained in German hands until the unconditional surrender of Axis Forces on May 8, 1945. Several of the port fortresses were resupplied by submarine after being surrounded by Allied forces. The defenders of these positions included Slavic soldiers and SS troops.

Silverstone

Silverstone is a village and civil parish in Northamptonshire, England. It is about from Towcester on the former A43 main road, from the M1 motorway junction 15A and about from the M40 motorway junction 10, Northampton, Milton Keynes and Banbury. The A43 now bypasses to the south-east of the village, between the village and the race circuit.

The village is listed in the Domesday Book.

In the Middle Ages the village trade was primarily in timber from the surrounding Whittlewood forest, through the use of coppicing. Coppicing is a method of managing a forest. It allows trees to regrow after they have been cut down. 

The first chapel in Silverstone was built by 1200 AD. In about 1780 the mediaeval building was replaced by a Georgian building. That building was enlarged in 1841 and 1852. The entire church was demolished (torn down) in the 1880's and replaced by the present Church of England parish church of Saint Michael. The building is a Gothic Revival designed by JP St Aubyn. It was finished in 1884.

The village has a public house, the White Horse Inn.

About south of the village is the Silverstone Circuit. It was a Royal Air Force bomber base during World War II. Now it is the home of the British Grand Prix, a Formula One race. The race track attracts more than 300,000 visitors each year.

Dave Murray ("David Michael Murray", born December 23, 1958 in Edmonton, London, England) is one of the three guitarists in the British heavy metal band, Iron Maiden. Murray has been with Iron Maiden since 1980.

Murray is considered the second original member of Iron Maiden along with the founder Steve Harris. He has played on every album since its debut in 1980. However, Murray joined in 1976, just two months after they formed in 1975. He was forced to leave the band that year by the vocalist Dennis Wilcock, but returned months later. His solos are characterized for being fluid and clean, making rapid progress note after note through techniques that use the right hand using especially a lot of "Hammer and tapping", based on the legato technique. A characteristic in live performance is the vocalization which makes while playing fast parts, as if singing at the same time than playing his Fender Stratocaster

David Michael Murray was born on December 23, 1956 in Edmunton, England. Dave's mother often worked part time at a bar, because his father was at a young age retired consequence of a disease. The money for the maintenance of the house came irregularly. The frustration and poverty took their parents to a continuous fighting which caused her mother to take him together with her sisters to the nearest army refuge, where they used to spend weeks protected from the occasional attacks of fury of his father.

During his adolescence, Dave was interested in music, so he developed an cardboard-electric guitar to mimic the Beatles records, also that he risked playing with the piano of a bar that was located in the bottom of a residential complex in which they lived for some time. In 1970 his family finally rented a more comfortable house in the county of Clapton, and that's how the future partner of Steve Harris, like many other teens in that time shaved his head.

The moment that completely changed the life of Dave and took him to a career which seemed impossible in his time and those who followed the style of skinhead, occurred at the age of 15 when heard for the first time the song "Voodoo Child" (part 2) of Jimi Hendrix on the radio, then it started to listen to bands like Thin Lizzy, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, UFO, Queen, Free, Judas Priest and Wishbone Ash.

Dave's love for rock understood everything he was referring to the "rock culture" so he grew his hair too much, which caused him problems with his skinhead friends. He Adopted hippie clothes and began to read the newspaper "Melody Maker" which spoke of the rock of that time, which also began to frequent shows and come out with a new group of friends, being the closest, Adrian Smith.

In terms of sound, he used a super distortion humbucker made ​​by Dimarzio, who was replaced for a compact hot rails humbucker of the firm Seymour Duncan. both in bridge position.

Together with Steve Harris, Dave was the only "irremovable member" of Iron Maiden since its founding. He has participated in all records and has been a key piece to define the sound of the group, although it has not participated much in the compositions of letters he composed the rhythm guitar to most of the compositions of Steve Harris.

Between their compositions are the songs "Charlotte the Harlot" from the first album, "Still Life" from the album "Piece of Mind." "Deja Vu" from the album "Somewhere In Time," "Chains Of Misery" and "Judas Be My Guide" from the album "Fear of the Dark," "Brave New World", "The Nomad" and "The Thin Line between Love and Hate" from the album "Brave New World", "Rainmaker" and "Age of Innocence" from the album "Dance of Death" and "the Reincarnation of Benjamin Breege" from the album "A Matter of Life and Death"

Food Power

In politics, the use of agriculture or agricultural products to influence the outcome of decisions is called Food Power. Several nations with crude oil have organised themselves and founded a cartel called OPEC. Through this cartel, they can fix the price at which they will sell oil. Food power works in much the same way. Nations usually do what is best for their citizens, who usually want food. 

Food power is part of food politics. Embargoes can also be used to put pressure on a nation. In order for a nation to make use of food power effectively, the nation must effectively apply and display scarcity, supply concentration, demand dispersion, and action independence. The four main nations that export enough agriculture to be able to exert food power are the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The U.S. does appear to use food power for punishment. Some African countries have used food power in internal conflicts on a smaller scale.

Arecibo message

The Arecibo message was a short radio message sent into space to celebrate the remodeling of the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico in 1974. It was aimed at the globular star cluster M13, about 25,000 light years from Earth. M13 was chosen because it was the right size, and was in the sky at the right time and place for the ceremony. 

Dr. Frank Drake, then at Cornell University and creator of the famous Drake equation, wrote the message, with help from Carl Sagan, among others. The message was in seven parts which show:

It will take 25,000 years for the message to reach the stars, and at least another 25,000 years to get any reply. This means the Arecibo message was a show of human technological achievement, not a real attempt to talk to extraterrestrial life. The stars of M13 that the message was aimed at will no longer be in that location when the message arrives. Cornell University said on November 12, 1999, the real purpose of the message was not to make contact, but to show the power of the new equipment. (Cornell University had built and operated the radio telescope for the United States National Science Foundation.)

The message consisted of 1679 binary digits, about 210 bytes. It was transmitted at a frequency of 2380 MHz and modulated by shifting the frequency by 10 Hz, with a power of 1000 kW. The "ones" and "zeros" were transmitted by frequency shifting at the rate of 10 bits per second. The total broadcast was less than three minutes.

The cardinality of 1679 was chosen because it is a semiprime. It can be arranged as a rectangle of 73 rows by 23 columns. The other arrangement, 23 rows by 73 columns, does not produce a meaningful result. The message forms the image shown on the right, or its inverse, when translated into graphics characters and spaces.

In 2009 the band Boxcutter made an album called the "Arecibo Message", which has a lot of short songs.

Goliath (Walibi Holland)

Goliath is a steel roller coaster in the Dutch theme park Walibi Holland. The lift hill has a height of 46,8 meter which makes it the tallest coaster of the Benelux. However, in 2007 this record was beaten by Vertigo in Walibi Belgium, but after Vertigo was demolished in 2008, Goliath was again the tallest coaster of the Benelux.

The coaster was created by the Swiss coaster manufacturer Intamin AG and was opened in 2002. The coaster has a maximum speed of 66 miles per hour (106 km/h) over 3,982 feet (1,214 m) of track. The coaster has 2 trains, one green and one purple with hydraulic lap bars as restraints.

Xpress

Xpress is a steel roller coaster at Walibi Holland in The Netherlands. It opened in 2000 under the name "Superman the Ride". However, Six Flags was planning to open it under the name "Riddlers Revenge" and the ride was painted green at the factory. Shortly before the coaster was built, the name was changed to "Superman the Ride" and was painted red and blue. Since 2005 the coaster is called "Xpress" and was painted pink. It is the first LSM coaster in Europe.

Since April 2011 the coaster is standing, but not operating. The reason for this is because important parts of the launch mechanism are broken, which can cause that the train does not have enough speed at the end of the launch, or doesn't launch at all. These parts are ordered and are only made on request, as there are only 3 coasters of this type worldwide (2 of which are in Disney parks). Therefore, Walibi Holland decided to paint the track.

Sylvia Ratonel

Sylvia Anne Ratonel, born June 14, 1988, is a Singaporean recording artist and spokesmodel of Euro-Filipina extraction. She is widely known as the first female finalist and runner-up of the third season of Singapore Idol. The show launched her career in singing and entertainment; in January 2010, less than a month after the competition, she signed a full-time contract with national broadcaster MediaCorp, and sealed a recording deal with Universal Music Singapore in March of the same year. Sylvia also became the first Singaporean celebrity ambassador for cosmetic brand Maybelline New York. In 2010, Sylvia Ratonel was ranked as part of the Top 100 Sexiest Women in the World by FHM Magazine. She also won the Breakout Star of the Year ELLE Awards 2010.

Her eponymous debut album, "Sylvia Ratonel" was released on 27 October 2010. Four singles were released from the album, three of which became Top 10 hits on Singapore radio charts.

Sylvia comes from a family of five, and has two brothers Bryan and Timothy. Her family faced financial struggles in her early years. When she was 10, the family moved into a small flat with only a living room and no bedroom. Sylvia later said in an interview that they "grew up sleeping together in one room, on mattresses". Life was not easy for her family. At times, they had to depend on church rations and would go to church every Sunday to receive food. Sylvia and her family now live in a two-bedroom HDB flat.

Sylvia attended Fengshan Primary School, and graduated to Bedok View Secondary School, where she transferred from the Normal (Academic) stream to the Express stream. She opted for a polytechnic education at Temasek Polytechnic with the intention to start working earlier. Sylvia eventually graduated with a diploma in Hospitality and Tourism Management. She worked part-time to supplement the family income during her time in Temasek Polytechnic. After graduating, Sylvia deferred her plans to pursue a degree to avoid burdening her parents. Instead, she went to work at the Conrad Centennial Hotel as a secretary.

Growing up, Sylvia considered herself shy and timid and did not participate in school performances. Her family enforced a strict upbringing, such as the rule to return home everyday before 8pm. At the age of 18, Sylvia left home in what was a rebellious phase, and began visiting clubs and drinking alcohol. She has since mended her relationship with her family and refers to herself as "a good girl who likes bad boys". Under the persuasion and encouragement of her family, Sylvia decided to audition for Singapore Idol in 2009 albeit having no professional vocal coaching prior to the competition.

On 6 June 2009, Sylvia participated in the auditions for the third season of Singapore Idol, held at The Cathay cineplex. Her audition impressed judge Ken Lim, who asserted that she had the potential to make it into the Top 10. Sylvia passed the callbacks and theatre auditions, with the judges' opinions divided on the amount of talent and potential that she possessed. However, at the Piano Show round in September, she managed impressed the judges with her rendition of Duffy’s "Mercy".

For several rounds, Sylvia alternated between being one of the strongest and weakest contestants, landing in the bottom two on two occasions. However, beginning with the Top 6 round, her support from the viewers had gained even momentum for her to advance through each round for five consecutive weeks, safely avoiding the elimination group in every round. After competing in the last semi-final round on 8 December, Sylvia became the first female finalist on Singapore Idol. On 27 December 2009, she competed against Sezairi Sezali for the title of Singapore Idol, and finished the competition as the runner-up. Despite being disappointed, Sylvia has expressed happiness of being able to reach the finals, saying “my Idol journey has been wonderful. I would never change anything about it. It’s been a really long and tiring journey, but it’s so fulfilling... I’m really glad that I managed to touch many people’s hearts, and their lives. I hope to continue doing that,”

In a post-Idol televised interview with both Ken Lim and Sylvia present, Lim answered that he "didn't think that [Sylvia] did well" when asked about his opinions regarding the results, and compared her performances in the finals as weaker than those she had in the semi-final rounds. 

Sylvia's first public performance after Singapore Idol was at the Celebrate 2010 Countdown Party @Marina Bay. She sang Empire State of Mind together with the rest of the Singapore Idol Top 13.

In January 2010, less than a month after Singapore Idol, Sylvia Ratonel was signed on a full-time contract with national broadcast station MediaCorp. She was also engaged to promote the launch of the new Motorola Dext social-networking phone. On 23 and 24 January, she appeared in promotional events at the Iluma cineplex in Singapore. Later in March , she signed a record deal with Universal Music Singapore. Her pan- Asian look caught the eye of make-up brand Maybelline and in that same month, she also became the new face of Maybelline New York, the first Singaporean celebrity ambassador for the popular cosmetics brand.

Sylvia appeared as a guest star in the MediaCorp telemovie "Seven Days". In the movie she performed the duet "You and I" with Rai from the Singaporean pop duo Jack & Rai. In June, Sylvia made her debut as co-host alongside Michelle Chia in the MediaCorp weekly food variety show "Buffetlicious" on MediaCorp Channel 5.

On the 45th National Day Parade of Singapore, she lip-synced to a dance version of the parade's theme song, "Song For Singapore" alongside Sezairi Sezali. She was honored to perform the National Anthem of Singapore before the start of the Singapore F1 Grand Prix race on September 26, 2010. In the same month, Sylvia made it to the Top 100 Sexiest Women in the World list of FHM. Sylvia also appeared on cover for Cleo in March 2010 and November 2010. 
She was also posted on cover for Seventeen Magazine. Sylvia won the Breakout Star of the Year ELLE Awards 2010 in December 2010. Later that same month, Sylvia recorded a duet of "Come Home to 5" with Sezali, a promotional theme song for Channel 5 which has being airing since 24 December 2010.

Sylvia has released one studio album and four radio singles in her music career so far.

Her eponymous debut album "Sylvia Ratonel" was released in Singapore on 27 October 2010. The musical direction of the album was noted for differing from the usual acoustic genre she specialised in during Singapore Idol. Apart from a cover of an 1980s song titled "Manic Monday" and a Malay-language track "Mari Bersamaku", the album consists of completely original tracks co-written by Sylvia and producer Don Richmond. The album is features several pop ballads and upbeat R&B tracks. Online music blog Spin or Bin Music described the album as "a roller coaster ride because it can, and will, take the listener to the emotional highs and lows that are the product of the incredible diversity in the album." 

A few songs on the album are personal recounts of Sylvia's life. "Foolish This Way" expresses the emotional experiences of past relationships and was described by her as "very slow, very heartfelt, a tearjerker". "Loving You", the first song she co-wrote with Richmond, was inspired by good life experiences. It was reported that "Come Runaway With Me" was written as an English adaptation to the Malay track "Mari Bersamaku" due to her love for the latter.

Unlike first Singapore Idol winner Taufik Batisah's debut album, no sales certification has been announced for "Sylvia Ratonel", implying low to moderate sales for the album. This is significantly attributed by the weak influence of local pop music on Singaporean pop culture. 

The album has seen the release of four singles. All of them were released only on radio format as Singapore's music industry generally does not practice CD sales and digital downloads for local singles. It began with the lead single "Fly" in May 2010, a jazz-pop song produced and written by Don Richmond. The single was described as "uplifting and empowering" and "about what a Maybelline girl should be." "Fly" was also featured in a Maybelline New York advertisement to represent "The Power In You" campaign, where Sylvia acts as the spokesperson for Singapore. The song received positive reviews, with many listeners noting that Sylvia's vocal performance in the song was indifferent from international standards. Sylvia performed the song during the Maybelline New York Launch at Cathay Cineleisure Orchard on May 28, 2010. "Fly" narrowly missed the Top 5, peaking at #6 on the Top 20 Chart of 987FM, a pop radio station in Singapore that appeals to younger audiences. However, the song ranked at #73 at the radio's year-end chart. 

Her second single, "It's Raining", was released in September 2010 to positive reception. Sylvia performed the acoustic version of the song on Channel NewsAsia and on a results episode of national television show "One Moment of Glory". Wider promotion of the song allowed "It's Raining" to outperform "Fly". It became Sylvia's first Top 5 hit when it reached #3 on the 987FM Top 10 Chart. It remained in the 987FM Top 20 for 12 consecutive weeks, although it did not manage to enter the year-end chart. The song is Sylvia's only Top 5 hit to date. It's Raining" was accompanied by a music video, a first in Sylvia's career, and it was first broadcast nationally on MediaCorp Channel 5 on 19 November 2010. The video has received generally negative reviews from online viewers on Youtube, with most of the criticism highlighting poor directorial skills, unimpressive video editing, a budgeted production and Sylvia's uncomfortable disposition and awkward dancing. As of July 2011, the video has been viewed only 62 000 times, which is 20 000 views short of the video views for Sezairi Sezali's "Broken".

"Mari Bersamaku" was released as Sylvia's first Malay single (and third overall). It debuted in the Top 20 of the RIA Chartz at 89.7FM in December 2010 and peaked at #11, becoming Sylvia's first single not to reach the Top 10. Her latest and possibly final single from "Sylvia Ratonel", "Loving You", charted for 7 consecutive weeks inside the 987FM Top 20 Chart and peaked at #8 in March 2011. Both "Mari Bersamaku" and "Loving You" do not have accompanying music videos due to the negative reception of the "It's Raining" music video and financial constraints.

Shire (Middle-earth)

The Shire is a fictional location is part of the legendarium created by the British author J. R. R. Tolkien and appears in their novels The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. 

It is a region in the northwest of Middle-earth, one of the continents of the fictional world of Arda where elapses the most part of J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. It is, in turn, within the great region of Eriador, where previously existed the kingdom of Arnor. Is inhabited only by hobbits, a race similar to the men and characterized by their short stature. Founded in the middle of the Third Age, their known history is small and with little significants events because the peaceful nature of its inhabitants, with the exception of the events that took place during the War of the Ring.

Even if is not mentioned as such in the novel The Hobbit, J. R. R. Tolkien already was then an idea of what was the Shire, was created "officially" during the composition of the first chapter of The Lord of the Rings and inspired principally in the neighborhood of Sarehole, Birmingham, where the author lived during his childhood.

Hobbits sometimes call it Sûza (which means "Shire") or Sûzat ("the Shire"), terms that have their origin in the Rohirric, the language of Rohan with which they came in contact before colonizing the Shire. On the other hand, in the Elvish language Sindarin they call it "i Drann". It is also called ""Four frames"", the name refers to their territorial division.

According to Tolkien, the Shire measured 40 leagues (193 km, 120 miles) from the Far Downs in the west to the Brandywine Bridge in the east, and 50 leagues (241 km, 150 miles) from the northern moors to the marshes in the south, This is confirmed in an essay by Tolkien on translating The Lord of the Rings, where he describes the Shire as having an area of 18,000 square miles (47,000 km²).

The original territory of the Shire was bounded on the east by the Baranduin River, on the north by uplands rising to the old centre of Arnor, on the west by the White Downs, and on the south by marshland south of the River Shirebourne. After the original settlement, hobbits also expanded to the east into Buckland between the Baranduin and the Old Forest, and (much later) to the west into the Westmarch between the White Downs and the Tower Hills.

The Shire was originally divided into four Farthings. The outlying lands of Buckland and the Westmarch were formally added after the War of the Ring when they were officially granted by King Elessar.. Within the Farthings there are some smaller unofficial clan homelands: the Tooks nearly all live in or near Tuckborough in Tookland, for instance. A Hobbit surname often indicates where the family came from: Samwise Gamgee's last name derives from Gamwich, where the family originated. Buckland was named for the Oldbucks (later called the Brandybucks).

The Shire was densely populated, with many towns and few cities, but still had large areas of forests and wetlands. It is described as a "small land", but beautiful and fruitful, beloved by its inhabitants. Their location gives it a natural fertility and therefore the hobbits have an extensive farming system, being able to find many supplies such as cereals, fruits, wood and pipe-weed (one of the favorite pleasures of the hobbits). However, its economy is almost self-sufficient and hobbits typically consume all the products of their crops, or reserve them for gifts.

The Shire is a region of low elevations, and these are no higher than hills. The main ones are:





The climate in the Shire was primarily temperate maritime or ocean, depending on the area. In general, temperatures are slightly warmer in the south than in the north and seasonal changes of temperature are lightly more pronounced (hotter summers and colder winters) in the extreme east than the extreme west. The rainfalls are moderate throughout the whole year and especially in the Northframe, Can snow during the occasional visits of polar air from the north.

The Shire is populated exclusively by hobbits and in the time of the War of the Ring, the whole race, except a few who lived in the nearby town of Bree, was there. The hobbits are characterized by short stature, between 60 and 120 centimeters, and the abundant hairs grow them on the tops of the feet.

Although there were various branches of hobbits, all ended by unite when the Albos founded the Shire mixing thus their physical characteristics. The residents of marshes, descended of the Forts,are the only ones that can differ slightly from the rest hobbits because to them grow fuzz on his chin, while the rest have absolutely no beard. In Marish had also lived the "family Gamoviejo" before moving to "Buckland" and change his last name to Brandybuck.

Between the known families are the "Took","Handbag","Bolger","Gamgee","Brandybuck","Sackville","Cornet","Boffin","Proudfoot","Burrow","Dachshund", and "Round". Each family usually have a land or town in which usually sits and takes his name or any derivative, for example Gamgyi come from "Town of Gamwich" and "Took" live mostly on the "Took Land" in Green Hills.

No Me Queda Más

"No Me Queda Más" () is a song by American singer Selena. The song was written by Ricky Vela, a Selena y Los Dinos keyboardist. Selena's brother, A.B. Quintanilla III had helped with writing the song as well. It became the third single released from the album "Amor Prohibido" (1994). The song talks about an emotional distraught woman who had recently fallen in love with a man, but later finds out he is getting married. The woman then feels like there's nothing left to live for without being with him. 

"No Me Queda Más" became the most successful single, along with "Amor Prohibido", of 1994 and 1995 in the United States and Mexico. The song later became one of Selena's signature songs after it had won several awards at the Tejano Music Awards. "No Me Queda Más" won the "Video of the Year" award at the "Billboard" Latin Music Awards. The single peaked at number–one on both the US Hot Latin Tracks and the Latin Regional Mexican Airplay charts on "Billboard". It became Selena's third number–one single for the album "Amor Prohibido". Various recording artists worldwide have since made their own versions of "No Me Queda Más". To celebrate and honor Selena during her fifteenth anniversary of her death, Music Choice On Demand, selected several Selena music videos as a tribute to over 42 million homes nationwide.

The song was given positive feedback from music critics. Selena promoted the song during the Amor Prohibido Tour (1994-95). 

"No Me Queda Más" was written by Ricky Vela, who was a keyboardist for Selena y Los Dinos. He had wrote the song out-of-emotions after finding out that Suzette Quintanilla, who he had liked and was the sister of Selena, was married. Selena's brother A.B. Quintanilla III had co-wrote the song and had wanted Selena to record it for her fifth studio album. The song was recorded at Q-Productions in Corpus Christi, Texas after Selena's "Live! Tour" was finished. The song became the first recorded song to be written out-of-emotions by the band. The second song to do so was "Si Una Vez" () which was written by Pete Astudillo, it was also included in "Amor Prohibido" (1994). "No Me Queda Más" talks about an emotional distraught woman who had recently fallen in love with a man, but later finds out he is getting married. The woman then feels like there's nothing left to live for without being with him. 

Selena promoted "No Me Queda Más" during her Amor Prohibido Tour. Fans who attended a special episode of Cristina Saralegui's show "El Show De Cristina" in 1994, saw Selena perform the song for the first time. Her finale performance was on March 14, 1995 at Calle Ocho Festival in Miami, Florida, which attracted over 100,000 fans.

The song was performed on B major with a tempo of 95 beats per minute. The song was a power ballad. It also had flamenco music in it. The song had several musical instruments, such as the french horn, violin and cello.

Onet.pl, a Polish newspaper, described "No Me Queda Más" as one of the several hits that Selena recorded for "Amor Prohibido" (1994). Ramiro Burr of Amazon, stated that "[No Me Queda Más is a] lovely and stoic song facing the end, yet keeping a sense of dignity and self-worth [...]". To celebrate and honor Selena during her fifteenth anniversary of her death, Music Choice On Demand, selected several Selena music videos as a tribute to over 42 million homes nationwide. On July 30, 2010, while the Corpus Christi Hooks were in the middle of their game, a Selena tribute was performed. It had included "No Me Queda Más" as the opening song.

"No Me Queda Más" became the most successful singles, along with "Amor Prohibido", of 1994 and 1995 in the United States and Mexico.

The music video begins with a women (Selena) sitting down at an outside restaurant, waiting for her boyfriend to arrive. A Mariachi band keeps the customers entertained while eating their food. A waiter offers the women a glass of water. The waiter returns to give the women her entrée that she had ordered. The women then eats her food peacefully while enjoying the live entertainment. As she eats her dinner, the waiter returns to give her a note that her boyfriend had left for her. In the note, her boyfriend tells her that he can no longer see her and does not want to be with her anymore. He tells her that, because he was getting married to another women. The women, now depressed, takes a sip of water before exiting the restaurant crying.

The song then plays slowly as Selena is seen in the dark, behind a busy highway, pealing off a white rose. This resembles "he loves me...he loves me not...", while crying. While performing this, pictures of Selena and her now ex-boyfriend are seen throughout the video. Now the video shines on Selena wearing her white dress. She is singing on a staircase, with an orchestra playing their instruments. Selena is then seen at the wedding of her ex-boyfriend. She tries to enter the wedding, which is near the beach. However, she is pulled away by her emotions and instead cries running. She then crouch down to the floor and cries and tells herself "what was wrong with me?" and "why didn't he like me?" (in Spanish). After this, Selena's ex-boyfriend and fiancée acknowledge their marriage and share a kiss. After the wedding, the final video of Selena and her ex-boyfriend is played, where he had kiss Selena's hands. The video then ends with him hugging his now wife, and Selena crying, looking down.

Tejano Music Awards

The Tejano Music Awards is an annual music awards ceremony that is held in San Antonio, Texas to recognize and build awareness for Tejano music. The first "TMA's" began in 1980.

In 1986, Selena won the "Female Vocalist of The Year" award and continued to win the award for nine consecutive years, up until her death. She had won two awards after her death. Selena dominated the awards beginning the 90's when she helped spread the Tejano Music Movement into the United States. She was then given the title "Queen of Tejano music". 

Being a male-dominate genre, the Tejano Music Awards continued to see a rise in more male entertainers receiving awards such as Emilio Navaira, Jay Perez, and La Mafia. The group, La Mafia, became the first male Tejano group to sell a gold album (sales of 50,000 units). For the females, Selena's album Ven Conmigo (1990) became the very first Tejano album to ever be certified gold by the RIAA.

Selena y Los Dinos

Selena y Los Dinos was the band which Mexican-American Tejano pop singer Selena belonged to until her untimely death in 1995.

The band was created when Selena was nine-years old by her father, Abraham Quintanilla Jr. He immediately spread his musical talent (which he pursued himself in his earlier days) among his three children. Suzette was put on the drums. A.B. was put on the bass guitar. The family first showcased their band at their restaurant "Papa Gayos" (English: "Parrots"). Then they continued to sing at more and more different places.

Within a year the family's restaurant went bankrupt and the family was forced to move in with relatives as Abraham had quit his job to manage the restaurant full-time. The band then performed wherever they could, including weddings, street corners, fairs, and quinceañeras, at some places gaining a lot of appreciation, while others not so much. The band was even "booed" off while performing at a wedding, followed by food being thrown on stage.

In 1988, the Quintanilla family was present at a party of the band Chris Pérez was currently in. Impressed by his talent, A.B. asked Chris to join "Selena y Los Dinos". Although he accepted, his support to the band proved to be much more than anticipated. Selena and Chris quickly fell in love and married in 1992. After Selena's death, Chris formed a band called the Chris Pérez Band which he dedicated a song to the Selena called "The Best I Can". After the band broke up in 2002, he formed another band with Selena's brother A.B. called Kumbia All Starz.

The band members reunited for the tribute concert, in honor of Selena, on April 7, 2005. Selena ¡VIVE!, was held at the Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas. Not only did the event sold-out, it became the highest-rated and most-viewed Spanish-language Television special ever in the history of American television. The introduction was made by Jennifer Lopez.

Handstand

A handstand is the act of holding the body upside down balancing on the hands. The body is held straight with arms and legs fully extended. The hands are placed about shoulder-width apart. A handstand performer must have balance and upper body strength.

Handstands are used in many activities, including acro dance, acrobatics, cheerleading and gymnastics. Some type of handstand is performed on all gymnastic equipment. Many tumbling skills pass through a handstand position as part of the action. Breakdancers use handstands in freezes and kicks. Sometimes a handstand is used as a starting position for diving. In games or contests, swimmers will sometimes do underwater handstands on pool bottoms with legs and feet extended above the water.

Handstands are known by various other names. In yoga, the handstand is known as "Adho Mukha Vrksasana" (pronounced AHD-hoh MOOK-hah vrik-SHAH-sah-nah) translating to Downward-facing Tree Pose, and in capoeira it is named bananeira.

There are two basic handstands used in modern gymnastics: "curved-back" and "straight-back". Straight-back style is used when straight body lines are wanted and possible. In many cases the curved-back style is better as it has much better control over balance. Balance is kept by shifting body weight towards the fingers or the heel of the hand.

All basic handstands have these features:

Straight-back handstands have these characteristics:

<doc id="300963" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=300963" title="Globular cluster">
Globular cluster

A Globular cluster is a collection of stars that orbits a galactic center. The force of gravity holds such clusters together and gives them a spherical shape. Towards the center, such clusters have large star densities; there are many stars in a relaticely small space. The name of this category of star cluster is derived from the Latin "globulus"—a small sphere. A globular cluster is sometimes known more simply as a "globular".

Globular clusters are found in the halo of a galaxy and in its disk. Those in the halo contain many more stars and are much older than the less dense galactic, or open clusters in the disk. Globular clusters are fairly common; there are about 150 to 158 currently known globular clusters in the Milky Way, with perhaps 10 to 20 more still undiscovered. Large galaxies can have more: Andromeda, for instance, may have as many as 500. Some giant elliptical galaxies, particularly those at the centers of galaxy clusters, such as M87, have as many as 13,000 globular clusters. These globular clusters orbit the galaxy out to large radii, 40 kiloparsecs (approximately 131,000 light-years) or more.

Every galaxy of sufficient mass in the Local Group has an associated group of globular clusters, and almost every large galaxy surveyed has been found to possess a system of globular clusters. The Sagittarius Dwarf and Canis Major Dwarf galaxies appear to be in the process of donating their associated globular clusters (such as Palomar 12) to the Milky Way. This demonstrates how many of this galaxy's globular clusters might have been acquired in the past.

Although it appears that globular clusters contain some of the first stars to be produced in the galaxy, their origins and their role in galactic evolution are still unclear. It does appear clear that globular clusters are significantly different from dwarf elliptical galaxies and were formed as part of the star formation of the parent galaxy rather than as a separate galaxy. However, recent articles by astronomers suggest that globular clusters and dwarf spheroidals may not be clearly separate and distinct types of objects.

Boomerang (roller coaster)

Boomerang is a coaster type made by Vekoma, named after the original boomerang. The first Boomerang began operation in 1984 at Rafaela Padilla in Puebla, México (which has since been moved to Six Flags México), and it has become one of the most repeated roller coaster designs in the world, with 41 Boomerangs operating as of 2011, another two "Standing But Not Operating" or in storage, and one currently under construction.

The Boomerang operates with one train with 7 cars, each capable of carrying 4 people (28 people per train). The ride starts with the train being pulled backwards out of the station, up a lift hill by a catch-car. When the catch-car reached the end of the lift hill, it releases the train, which rolls down, through the station, into a cobra roll. After the cobra roll, it goes through a looping after which it clicks onto a chain on the second lift hill. When the train reaches the end of the second lift hill, the chain is moved down, which causes the train to roll down (as it is not attached to the chain anymore) and do the same track backwards.

Boomerang coasters have sometimes stalled, often in the cobra Roll element. As a precaution, many Boomerang coasters, are built with an access platform just under the cobra roll. Also, sometimes the train gets stuck on the second lift hill.

Languages of South Africa

South Africa has eleven official languages. They are Afrikaans, English, Ndebele, Northern Sotho, Sotho, Swazi, Tswana, Tsonga, Venda, Xhosa and Zulu. Most South Africans (over 99%) speak one of these languages as a first language. Most South Africans can speak more than one language. Prior to 1994, South Africa had only two official languages, English and Afrikaans.

The English version of the South African constitution calls each of these languages by its name in that language. Zulu is called "isiZulu", Xhosa language is called "isiXhosa", and so on. The languages listed in the constitution are: isiZulu (Zulu), isiXhosa (Xhosa), Afrikaans (Afrikaans), Sepedi (Northern Sotho), Setswana (Tswana), English (English), Sesotho (Southern Sotho), Xitsonga (Tsonga), Siswati (Swati), Tshivenda (Venda), and isiNdebele (Southern Ndebele).

In South Africa, Southern Ndebele is known simply as "Ndebele", since most speakers of Northern Ndebele live in Zimbabwe. The 1993 version of the Constitution referred to Northern Sotho as "Sesotho sa Leboa", but the 1996 version called it "Sepedi". Different government departments and official organizations use different names for Northern Sotho.

The main language of government is English. Afrikaans and English are both important languages used in commerce. Most affluent (rich) South Africans speak Afrikaans and English. 

Two of the official languages are West Germanic languages (English and Afrikaans). The other nine languages are Bantu languages. Four of the Bantu languages are part of the Nguni family (Zulu, Xhosa, Swati, Ndebele). Three of the Bantu languages are Sotho-Tswana languages (Northern Sotho, Southern Sotho, Tswana). Tsonga is a Tswa-Ronga language. South Africa also has a national sign languae, South African Sign Language.

The album was released on July 16, 1984 under Freddie Records, an independent studio label located in South Texas. Selena's father, Abraham Quintanilla Jr, removed his children from Freddie Records after he had told him that Selena would never become a famous singer, couldn't bring in large crowds, and wasn't professionally ready to release a full-length album. Selena was also underpaid because she was a female in a male-dominate genre and no could understand a female singer lead a Tejano band. She was made fun of and even booed off-stage by Tejano fans. Undetermined, Abraham moved his children to Cara Records. The album was re-released in 1995, after Selena's murder, entitled "Mis Primeras Grabcaciones" (English: "My First Recordings")

The New Girl in Town

The New Girl in Town is the second released album by Selena Y Los Dinos. The album comprises ten tracks, some of which were covers of songs performed by other artists before Selena, while the rest were written by Selena's father Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.

When Selena and her band did not receive much support from Freddie Martinez, the founder of Freddie Records, Abraham Quintanilla Jr, the father of Selena, began searching for another record label for the band. In the summer of 1984, "Cara Records" contacted him who had heard Selena during a recent concert and so they can sign "Selena y Los Dinos". Selena began to record tracks for her new album "The New Girl In Town" in late 1984. Cara Records released the album in 1985, but had to withdraw it after only two months due to conflicts with various song rights. Quintanilla then moved the band to the Manny Guerra labels GP Productions and RP Productions/Record Producer from 1985–1989, and finally to EMI in 1989. The song "Oh Mama" on Cara Records became very popular leading to appearances by Selena y Los Dinos on television shows like the "Johnny Canales Show".

Dreaming of You (album)

Dreaming of You is the last studio album recorded by American singer Selena. It was released on July 18, 1995 by EMI Records and EMI Latin. It was re-released on September 24, 2002 as part of the "Selena: 20 Years of Music" collection, which included bonus tracks, music videos and spoken liner notes by her family, friends, and her former band. "Dreaming of You" contains unreleased English and Spanish-language songs while also containing previously released songs that were remixed with dance hall and reggae. The first half of "Dreaming of You" contains mid-tempo R&B ballads and pop songs, while the rest of "Dreaming of You" contains Latin music.

By 1993, EMI Latin believed Selena was ready to release a crossover album. They believed she was ready because she had won a Grammy Award and other awards, signed a sponsorship tour with Coca-Cola, dominated the Latin music charts, and expanded the Tejano Music Movement across the United States (the Tejano Music Movement, which was a movement in Texas at the time, helped other people enjoy Tejano music and it becoming a popular trend). They also believed Selena had reached her peak in the Spanish-language market and they wanted to launch her into a career as an American solo pop artist. She was partnered with major pop music producers, some of whom were Grammy Award winners. The record company wanted to change Selena's musical styles from Tejano to contemporary R&B music, which was her dream. While Selena was recording songs, a crossover tour was being planned. However, before "Dreaming of You" was released, Selena was killed by Yolanda Saldivar.

"Dreaming of You" debuted at number one on the US "Billboard" 200 chart, and sold more than 331,000 copies in its first week. Selena became the first Hispanic singer to have an album, mostly in Spanish, debut at number one. It went on to be the second-highest-selling debut album, behind Michael Jackson. On the date of release, "Dreaming of You" sold 175,000 copies, which helped Selena to become the second-fastest selling female artist, behind Janet Jackson. "Dreaming of You" had a mixed to positive review from music critics. Several tracks from the album were released as singles in the the United States and other countries. "Dreaming of You" won several awards including every award it was nominated at the Tejano Music Awards and the Premio Lo Nuestro awards.

The title track, became instantly popular on radios throughout the United States. It peaked at number 22 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart and was able to reach the top 20 in many other charts. "I Could Fall in Love" also had the same success of the title track and peaked number two on the Hot Latin Tracks and number eight on the Hot 100 Airplay chart. "I'm Getting Used to You" peaked at number eight on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. The single "Tú Sólo Tú" peaked at number one on both the Hot Latin Tracks and Latin Regional Mexican Airplay charts. 

Selena performed at the 1989 Tejano Music Awards, which was attended by Jose Behar. Behar, the former president of Sony Music Latin, had recently opened EMI Latin. EMI Latin became the Latin division of EMI Records. The new president of Sony Music Latin was also attending the event and had wanted Selena to sign with his company. Selena's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla Jr was given offers from both Sony and EMI, however, Sony doubled the amount EMI was offering. Quintanilla Jr decided to go with EMI because they were offering the crossover deal Selena wanted, while Quintanilla Jr wanted his children to be the first band to sign with EMI Latin.

Before Selena signed her contract with EMI Latin in 1989, Behar and Stephen Finfer sent out a request to EMI Records for Selena to begin her crossover album. She recorded "Only Love", "Is It the Beat?", and "Where Did the Feeling Go?" for the presidents of EMI Records' pop division. Behar's and Finfer's request was denied. The presidents' told them that Selena needed a bigger fan base in order to sell a lot of copies of a crossover album. Behar told in an interview that he thought EMI Records, and people in general, did not believe that a Mexican American woman could be "successful". By 1993 Selena had won a Grammy Award for "Selena Live!" (1993), won several other awards, signed a sponsorship tour with Coca-Cola, dominated the Latin music charts, and expanded the Tejano Music Movement across the United States.

EMI Latin believed Selena should release a crossover album, believing she had reached her peak in the Spanish-language market. They wanted to launch her career as an American solo pop artist. Selena was signed with EMI's SBK Records in November 1993 after less than twenty-four hours in Los Angeles. News of Selena being signed with SBK made front-page news on "Billboard" magazine. Selena said that she was frighten by the recording deal because the situation was new to her and that only a few people had believed she would achieve success in the pop world. Selena said in interviews that the album would be released in 1994. However, following the release of "Amor Prohibido" in March 1994, she said the album was still being developed. During a dinner in a Thai restaurant in 1994, Selena was upset about the pressure she was under from the press about the album. She said, to Behar, that she told a lot of news crews that the album was about to be released and that she has yet to record a single song. Behar believed Selena was joking because she had always like telling jokes, but then noticed she was not setting up a joke and believed she was right. Behar then told the chairman of EMI Records, Charles Koppelman, that Selena and her band Los Dinos would leave EMI and find a record company willing to record an English-language album for Selena. Behar had lied to the chairman about Selena leaving in order to force the crossover album to begin. Koppelman did not want Selena to leave and began the recording sessions.

Selena started recording the first song for the album, "I Could Fall in Love", in late 1994. Selena was partnered with major pop music producers, some of which were Grammy Award winners. Selena's sister Suzette Quintanilla stated that Selena would take a very long time before deciding on a song that was "Selena". However, SBK Records controlled the entire project and only allowed Selena to choose one song. This was because, SBK knew what they were doing for a crossover event. Recording sessions for the album took place at several recording studios, including: her father's Q-Productions studio in Corpus Christi; The Bennett House in Franklin, Tennessee; Bananaboat Studio in Burbank, California; Oakshire Recorders in Los Angeles; Conway Studios in Hollywood; Clinton Studios in Clinton, New York; and Levosia Entertainment in Hollywood. Producers and songwriters who worked with Selena on the album included Keith Thomas, Trey Lorenz of Epic Records, Mark Goldenberg, Kit Hain, Guy Roche, Donna Delorey, Diane Warren, Rhett Lawrence, David Byrne of Luaka Bop Inc., Franne Golde, Tom Snow, Full Force, Brian "Red" Moore, A.B. Quintanilla III Selena's brother, Barrio Boyzz, K.C. Porter, Felipe Bernmejo, Jose Hernandez and Felipe Valdes Leal. Singers, Amy Grant and Vanessa Williams were both in the process of writing a song for Selena. "Dreaming of You" was the first album that Selena's family did not produce. Her family had wanted professional pop producers to work with Selena. Selena found this decision stressful, and felt that it was forced on her in order to sell records.

Selena co-wrote with David Byrne, former lead singer of Talking Heads, for his gospel song "God's Child (Baila Conmigo)". Her vocals were later used in the song after Byrne recorded it in Clifton, New York. Selena's brother Quintanilla III and her husband Chris Perez did not like "Dreaming of You". They both later stated that they grew to love it after Selena was murdered. While being interviewed, Keith Thomas stated that every time Selena would walk in the recording studio that all eyes would be on her because of her smiles, energy, and eager to succeed, who made everyone laugh. Thomas also stated that there were no ego problems with her. Selena had recorded songs in late 1994 and had recorded a total of six songs by January 20, 1995. Selena was supposed to record "Oh No (I'll Never Fall in Love Again)" on the morning of March 31, 1995. However, she was killed on the same day by Yolanda Saldivar, a friend and ex-manager of her clothing stores. "Oh No" was later recorded in Spanish by her brother's band, Kumbia Kings, on their album "Amor, Familia y Respecto" (2009). Thomas, who wrote "I Could Fall in Love", never finished his second song that Selena was supposed to record and talked about the song while being interviewed for the A&E series "Biography" in 2008. In 2008, freestyle singer Brenda K. Starr, revealed that she was supposed to be in two unrecorded duets with Selena. In June 2011, Dominican American Latin soul singer TeCheetah Lopez was given a demo of "Love Me Now", which was supposed to be for Selena to record. "Love Me Now" was written by Christopher Troy and Zac Harmon. According to Behar, "Dreaming of You" was supposed to be released in September or October 1995. In April 1995, EMI Latin decided to only release four out of the six English-language songs Selena had recorded. The song "Siempre Hace Frio" was taken off of "Dreaming of You".

"I Could Fall in Love", the first promotional single, was written by Keith Thomas and is a soft rock, pop, R&B and soul. "I Could Fall in Love" is written in the key of E major and moves at a moderate 86 beats per minute. Selena's vocal range in the song spans four octaves with music notes F#3-A4. Its lyrics are about a woman who is in love with a guy who does not know about her true feelings for him. She tries to tell him, but is afraid of rejection, she decides not tell him. According to "The Billboard Book of Number One Albums", "I Could Fall in Love" was chosen as the "best song" off of "Dreaming of You" and "... could melt the hearts of millions around the world". Kathleen Tracy wrote that "I Could Fall in Love" and "Dreaming of You" are two hit "ballads". James Hunter of "Vibe" stated that he liked Selena's passion that she used to record "I Could Fall in Love". Hunter also stated that the song is a "masterpiece", while also stating that because of Selena's death, it was hard to listen to the song without crying. After Selena's death, "I Could Fall in Love" became a popular wedding song.

"Dreaming of You", the lead single, was written by Franne Golde and Tom Snow. "Dreaming of You" is a power ballad and contemporary R&B. The song's main instruments are the piano, wind chimes and funk bass. "Dreaming of You" is written in Ab major and begins in the key of G♯(Ab). It changes to the key of A♯(Bb) after the bridge. Selena's vocal range spans Eb3-Eb5. "The Los Angeles Times" ranked "Dreaming of You" number five from their "Top-ten Singles of 1995". Its lyrics are about a lonely and depressed woman in her room at night, who dreams of being with her boyfriend. The song begins with a low-key instrumentation, which provides emphasis for Selena's vocals. Geraldo Martinez of "El Dictamen" wrote that the opening of the song was "surprisingly tantalizing". "Dreaming of You" became Selena's signature song and was given positive feedback from music critics.

"I'm Getting Used to You", the second promotional single, was written by Diane Warren and was produced by Rhett Lawrence. Four dance mixes were remixed by David Morales, which were created for promotional use. "I'm Getting Used to You" is a Baroque- and Dream-pop song and is written in the key of F major. Because of the music's easy piano notes it was included in the "Top Pop Hits of 1996 for Easy Piano" book. Its lyrics are about a woman who does not know what love is and her boyfriend tries to help her understand by "opening her eyes" to true love.

"Captive Heart", is a synthpop, electro and fast Rock song. "Captive Heart" is an uptemo song written by Kit Hain. It was released as the album's first promotional single in the United Kingdom. Its lyrics are about a woman being controlled by her partner who won't let her be free of her own emotions. She is unable to end the relationship because she is too in love with him. Ed Morales of "Vibe" compared both Evelyn "Champagne" King and "Wherever You Are" (the English version of "Donde Quiera Que Estes") with "Captive Heart". According to the "Chicago Tribune" "Captive Heart" was the right song for urban-contemporary radios. The "Daily Vault" believed Selena made a mistake with "Captive Heart" because she had used too much "throat" in the song.

"God's Child (Baila Conmigo)", a duet with David Byrne, was originally recorded for the "Don Juan DeMarco" soundtrack. After Selena was murdered, EMI Latin decided to use the song for "Dreaming of You". Byrne recorded his parts in New York, while Selena recorded her verse in Corpus Christi, Texas, at her father's recording studio. "God's Child" was later used for the "Blue in The Face" soundtrack. According to the "Chicago Tribune", "God's Child (Baila Conmigo)", is an "energetic, dark and mysterious" song. They also stated that the song is a rumba flamenco with rock and R&B. Christopher John Farley of "Time" stated that the song is a " ... giddy soulful song".

"El Toro Relajo" was an unreleased Spanish-language mariachi-ballad. It was written by Felipe Bermejo and produced by Jose Hernandez. It became the sixth single to be released from "Dreaming of You". Its lyrics are about a woman warning a man, during a bullfighting competition, that the bull is not tame. She then tries to tame the bull before her lover rides it. The band Mariachi Sol de Mexico were the backup singers for the song. "El Toro Relajo" was also recorded for the "Don Juan DeMarco" soundtrack. The "Daily Vault" believed the song was the "most impressive track" on "Dreaming of You". The "Daily Vault" also stated that it was "short, amusing, and dedicated". After Selena's death, the song became a traditional Cinco de Mayo celebration song. Brennan told "Time" magazine that he believes the company who dropped "El Toro Relajo" from the "Don Juan DeMarco" soundtrack, regrets ever doing so. "Tú Sólo Tú" became the seventh single released from "Dreaming of You". John Lannert of "Billboard" called it a "classic emotive (emotional) ballad". Christopher John Farley of "Time" said that "Tú Sólo Tú" is a "spirited mariachi song".

"Dreaming of You" was scheduled to be released sometime in 1994. However, following "Amor Prohibido", Selena's last Spanish studio album, the album was delayed. Selena told in an interview on January 20, 1995 that the album would be released in July. EMI Records and EMI Latin released "Dreaming of You" on July 18, 1995. It debuted at number one on the US "Billboard" 200 chart. "Dreaming of You" replaced the "Pocahontas" soundtrack spot as the number one album on the "Billboard" 200.

Selena fans in Dallas, Texas, began lining up to buy the album hours before stores were open. "Dreaming of You" sold 331,000 copies in its first week. It became the biggest first-week seller by a female artist. It also became the first album by a Hispanic artist to debut at number one. EMI believed that "Dreaming of You" sold more than 400,000 copies because SoundScan did not track copies sold in small stores.

"Dreaming of You" also debuted at number one on the "Billboard" Top Latin Albums and "Billboard" Latin Pop Albums charts. It remained on the charts for nearly two-hundred weeks. In Austin, stores were sold out of "Dreaming of You" within minutes on the day it was released. Throughout the entire city, Austin stores only allowed two copies per costumer. Fans in Corpus Christi began celebrating the release of "Dreaming of You" the day before the album was released, at music stores across the city.

It was certified 3.5 time platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipping more than 3,500,000 copies in its first year. "Billboard" named "I Could Fall in Love" and "Dreaming of You" the number one and two spots, in the "Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits". "Dreaming of You" sold over 2,000,000 copies its first year. EMI Latin was backed up with orders of 500,000 copies from retail stores. "Dreaming of You" was considered the "highest selling Latin album" since Julio Iglesias recorded his first English-language record "110 Bel Air Place" (1984). "Dreaming of You" was certified Gold in Canada, for shipments of 50,000 copies.

In the same month of its release, "Dreaming of You" joined five of Selena's studio albums that were in the top ten on the "Billboard" Top 50 Latin Albums. The album peaked at number one, two years later "Dreaming of You" and "Siempre Selena" (1996) continued to chart on the "Billboard" Latin 50. "Dreaming of You" became the first album by a Hispanic singer to debut at number one. Some Texas stores believed that the sale figures for "Dreaming of You" in their state were wrong because the album had sold poorly at their music stores.

The Crossover Tour was a scheduled world tour. It was supposed to help promote "Dreaming of You" worldwide. The tour was scheduled to begin in mid-1995, after the album was released. The Crossover Tour was also going to promote Selena in countries where she was not well known in.

There were several commercials released in the US, Mexico and South America. Behar said that promotion "... will be on the superstar scale" and that "[We] didn't put this marketing campaign behind it because there was a tragedy. ... We put this marketing campaign behind it because we believed that this was going to be a huge album because of the music. This is a record that we're going to work over the next 10 months."

In Texas and Mexico, bootleggers sold copies of "Dreaming of You". A bootlegger is a person who takes the music of an album and copy's it to a blank CD and make profit by selling the blank CDs to people on the streets. One, in Corpus Christi, tried selling a bootleg to Selena's father, without knowing who he was. Quintanilla Jr, took all the copies and reported the man to local police. There are no known reports of the public bootleggers, although Quintanilla Jr reported any he found to police. "TVyNovelas" believed that 50,000 copies of "Dreaming of You" bootlegs were sold, at five dollars each.

Credits are taken from the album's liner notes.

People who write content on Wikipedia do not have to give up their copyright to the material they contribute. However, they must license their changes under the copyleft licenses Wikipedia uses, which are the (CC-BY-SA) and (GFDL). Both of these licenses allow people to use and change text that they find on Wikipedia, but only as long as attribution is done.
The CC-BY-SA, section 4(c), states that: You must ... provide ... the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) ... and ... in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.
The GFDL, section 4-I, states that:... you must ... Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.
The Wikimedia Foundation's are clear that attribution will be supplied: in any of the following fashions: a) through a hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article or articles you contributed to, b) through a hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy which is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on this website, or c) through a list of all authors. (Any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions.)

If material is used "without" attributing the original authors, then these licensing terms have been broken. This violates the clause of .

Not everything copied from one Wikipedia page to another needs to be attributed. If the text being copied was written by you, then you do not need to credit yourself. Content which you have rewritten in your own words also does not need attribution. However, attribution must be done when copying material by other users which is "creative" enough to be copyrightable under US law (which is the law for Wikipedia).

As guidance, none of the following are "creative expression" requiring attribution, for Wikipedia purposes: 

Quotes from external sources do not need to be attributed to the original Wikipedia contributor, but the original source must still be cited. However, even though attribution is not required in these cases, including a link is often useful.

Attribution can be provided in any of the ways found in the Terms of Use (listed above), although methods (a) and (c) — that is, through a hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article or articles you contributed to; or through a list of all authors — are the most useful for transferring text from one Wikipedia page to another. Either of them meets the licensing requirements if properly done.

While there may be many reasons to copy text from one page into another, there are other steps and templates, which may be needed in certain cases. For merging two articles together or content from one article into another, see . For splitting one article into two or more, see . 

If copying or moving by from another Wikimedia project that is licensed under CC-BY-SA (such as Wikimedia Commons, Wiktionary, and Wikispecies), attribution can be done either by providing a complete list of authors of the original content (the complete list can be generated by copying the history of the other page) or by providing a direct link to the original material. If the list of authors is short, this may be provided in the edit summary. A direct link (such as an ) should be included in the edit summary; the template can be used for the article's talk page. If leaving a list of authors, please also provide a URL to the original page in case it becomes necessary in the future to access that history. (See .) Although most Wikimedia projects are licensed under CC-BY-SA and require attribution consistent with the , some projects are handled differently. For example, content from Wikinews is licensed under CC-BY and may be reused with attribution only to "Wikinews." (See .) It is the responsibility of the editor importing content to find out which license applies and make sure that attribution is satisfied.

Translations of copyrighted text, even from other Wikimedia projects, are derivative works, and attribution must be given to satisfy licensing requirements. When translating material from a Wikimedia project licensed under CC-By-SA, a note identifying the Wikimedia source (such as an ) should be made in edit summary and a link left to the original at the article's talk page. The template is available for this purpose.

There are also some situations in Wikipedia where copying may "not" be appropriate, such as if two articles are being created on the same subject because editors of the original cannot agree on what the article should say. This is called "". The proper solution to disagreement like this is to seek through .

If an article is , its history is removed. This means that its content cannot be reused on Wikipedia—even under the same article title—unless attribution is otherwise provided (or the page ). Deleted articles should not be recovered and reused from , Google cache, or the .

Sometimes, specific parts of an article's history are deleted. This may be because some of the revisions included copyright violations, attacks against other people, or personal information. This is done through , or . If the article still contains text which was placed by users whose revisions have been hidden, those must be attributed. should be used for this purpose, when it is possible; otherwise, talk page attribution will be necessary. A typical dummy edit summary could read, for instance codice_3

If an article is ""—copied or moved into —it must be fully attributed. If an article is being moved to userspace to avoid deletion (or to work on after deletion), the full history should be visible (restored if necessary) and then moved using the move button. If a user wishes to copy all or part of an article to work on in userspace, he or she should use an edit summary like codice_4.

Technically, failure to attribute correctly is a copyright violation. However, pages that contain unattributed text do not normally need to be deleted. Attribution can be supplied later by the methods above, using to record new edit summaries, or via talk page attribution using the template. Such delayed attribution should make clear when the copied text entered the page. 

When possible, the user who copied the text should be informed about the rules for copying text between pages. The template is available to help explain cut-and-paste moves. For other copying situations, the template can be used.

If a Wikipedia page was moved to another title by cutting and pasting, leaving a at the previous page, the licensing violation can be repaired through the use of the template. If the situation is more complicated—as for example if a new article has been started at the source page on a subject with a related title—the situation should be taken to the for administrator attention.

Nguni languages

The Nguni languages are a group of Bantu languages spoken by the Nguni people. These languages are spoken in Southern Africa, mostly in South Africa, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe. Nguni languages include Xhosa, Zulu, Swati, Hlubi, Phuthi and Ndebele (both Southern Ndebele and Northern Ndebele). 

The name "Nguni" comes from the cow breed called "Nguni cattle". The word "Nguni" is sometimes used to mean all speakers of Nguni languages as a group. This is an incorrect use of the word, since many different tribes speak these languages.

The Nguni languages are a sub-group of the Southern Bantu languages. These languages exist in a relatively small geographic area. The languages are closely related and sound very much alike. Many times the different languages are mutually intelligible -- that is, someone who speaks one Nguni language can understand someone speaking a different Nguni language.

Linguists and other researchers split the Nguni languages into two smaller groups: "Zunda Nguni" and "Tekela Nguni".

Dulce Amor

"Dulce Amor" () is the seventh and last independent LP record by Selena. The album became the final album to be released from RP Records. Selena's brother, A.B. Quintanilla III had became the main songwriter. Selena recorded fourteen songs but only released ten. All the songs were recorded in three different recording studios. "Dulce Amor" helped Selena to be noticed at the 1989 Tejano Music Awards. She was then signed by EMI Latin. The album had only sold over 30,000 copies. It was ordered to be removed from stores by EMI Records. 

Most of the songs produced were Tejano music mixed with Cumbia and Jazz fusion. "Dulce Amor" was nominated for "Album of the Year" while the song of the same name was nominated for "Song of the Year". Selena had won "Female Vocalist of the Year" and "Female Entertainer of the Year". Selena had promoted the album during her Dulce Amor Tour which had only lasted for less than a year. The album had mixed to negative reviews from music critics. The album was re-released in 2007 as "Classic Series Vol. 5".

After Selena's sixth LP record "Preciosa" (1988) sold only 25,000 copies, the company had wanted Selena to record another record. The success from "Preciosa" had the company believing that Selena would sell more copies with her next album. In July 1988, Selena was in the recording studio and began recording songs. Her brother, A.B. Quintanilla III had became the main songwriter for Selena. Juan Gabriel, a Mexican songwriter, had given Selena the rights to record "Costumbres". Ricky Vela, a Selena y Los Dinos member, had written the song "Quisiera Darte". The song "Qué" was written by Manny Guerra, the record manager for RP Records and GP Productions. The songs "Tú Solamente Tú" and "La Puerta Se Cerro" were written by unknown writers. On the liner notes, the writing credits are given to "Pendiente" which means "Pending" in Spanish.

It had took Selena three weeks to record fourteen songs. However, the record company only had wanted ten songs to be on the album. The others remained unreleased. Selena had recorded the songs "Dulce Amor", "Tú Solamente Tú", "La Puerta Se Cerro", "Costumbres", and "Dime" at RP Records studios in San Antonio, Texas. The songs "Always Mine", "No Llores Más Corazón" and "Cariño, Cariño Mio" were recorded in Houston, Texas. "Quisiera Darte" and the unreleased tracks were recorded in Hollywood, California. The song "Tú Solamente Tú" was originally recorded by Selena for her debut album "Selena y Los Dinos" (1984).

While Selena was performing at the 1989 Tejano Music Awards, Jose Behar (who was the former head of Sony Music Latin) was among the audience that night. He instantly wanted Selena to sign with EMI. Behar called his boss stating that he believe he had found the next Gloria Estefan. His boss told him that he was crazy, because Behar only had been in South Texas for only a week. Selena was later signed with EMI Latin the following year. "Dulce Amor" became her last independent LP record.

"Dulce Amor" was released on December 24, 1988. The album was supposed to be released in the summer of 1989. However, Manny Guerra had wanted the album to be released real quick. Guerra believed that if the album would have been released in the summer, that not too many Tejano fans would buy the album. He said, because popular music albums are released in that period. When the album was released, it had sold only 2,000 copies the first day. "Preciosa" (1988) had sold 3,600 copies on its first day. Guerra was not happy about the sales of the album. However, within a month the album sold 10,000 copies. It outperformed all of Selena's previous records. By August 1989, the album sold 33,206 copies. It was then pulled off shelves because of Selena's upcoming debut album with EMI Latin. EMI Latin bought all the original copies of the album. Only 50,000 copies of the album were shipped in Texas alone.

In 1995, Selena's father Abraham Quintanilla Jr had bought the rights to Selena's albums (1984-1989 period) from EMI Latin. Since then, he has released the songs in compilation albums. The songs "Always Mine", "No Llores Mas Corazon" and "La Puerta Se Cerro" were selected to be remixed for "Anthology" (1998). 

On September 7, 2007, Quintanilla Jr re-released the album as part of the "Classic Series" collection. "Dulce Amor" was then re-titled "Classic Series Vol. 5". All the songs were remastered.

"Dulce Amor" ("Sweet Love") was the lead single from "Dulce Amor". The song was written by A.B. Quintanilla III. It was produced by Timothy Muniz. "Dulce Amor" was nominated for "Song of the Year" at the 1989 Tejano Music Awards. The song had its key signature in common time. It was performed on G minor with 106 beats per minute. The songs lyrics are about a girl expressing her emotions about a guy she really love. The song was mixed with Cumbia music and Jazz fusion.

"Qué" ("What") was the second single released from "Dulce Amor". The song's writer is unknown. It was produced by Manny Guerra. The song was performed on G minor with 147 beats per minute. The songs lyrics are about a girl who has been tricked into believing that a guy really loved her. She feels a sense of loneliness and doubts herself. The songs' message is that, you can't always trust someone until you get to know them for who they really are. The song was mixed with Ranchera music and Mariachi.

"Always Mine" was the third single released from "Dulce Amor". The song was written by A.B. Quintanilla III. It was produced by Roger Garcia, who was the former back-up guitarist for Selena y Los Dinos. "Always Mine" was selected to be remixed for "Anthology" (1998). The remixed version peaked at number four on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart and number 94 on the Canadian Hot 100. The song describes a teen romance. A young girl who is under peer pressure by her friends must decide who she wants to be with. She struggles with low self-esteem. The song had its key signature in common time. It was performed on B minor with 100 beats per minute. The song was mixed with Polka, Pop and Contemporary R&B.

"Cariño, Cariño Mio" ("Sweetheart, Sweetheart of Mine") was the fourth single released from "Dulce Amor". The song was written by A.B. Quintanilla III. It was produced by Lauren and Carlos Diaz. The songs lyrics are about a girl who is in love with a guy. She sings about giving anything to him, just to be with him. The song had its key signature in common time. It was performed on D major with 103 beats per minute. The song was mixed with Polka and Jazz.

"Quisiera Darte" ("I Give") was the fifth and last single released from "Dulce Amor". The song was written by Ricky Vela, who was the lead keyboardist for Selena y Los Dinos. The song was produced by Manny Guerra. The songs lyrics are about a girl asking her boyfriend if their relationship is "love". She tells him that she would do anything for him, and feels that their relationship is love. The song had its key signature in common time. It was performed on C minor with 93 beats per minute. The song was mixed with Jazz and Cumbia music.

Selena had promoted "Dulce Amor" during her Dulce Amor Tour. Selena also promoted "Preciosa" (1988) along with her Dulce Amor Tour. This was because the two albums were released in the same year. Selena had performed songs from "Dulce Amor" on the Johnny Canales Show in South Texas, she also had done live concerts across Texas. Selena earned $20,000 from the Dulce Amor Tour, which was double the amount she had made for her Preciosa Tour.

Norberto Garcia of "Texas Monthly" stated that "Dulce Amor" was one of Selena's "strongest" LP record because it "showcase her exotic voice and expanded her talents[...]". Domingo Rivera of "Tejano Nation" believed every song on "Dulce Amor" was horrible. Rivera stated that he did not like not even one song. He also stated that Selena could have done better with modern styles of Tejano music instead of mixing 1960s music into her songs. Rivera then stated the album was "out of date" even when it was released in 1988. Sophia Vargas of "Tejano Weekly" believed that "Dulce Amor" was not Selena's best of work. Vargas believed that RP Records did not put their "all" for Selena.

But I'm a Cheerleader

But I'm a Cheerleader is an LGBT based comedy that was released in 1999. Natasha Lyonne acts in the movie as a high school cheerleader who thinks she's straight, but then comes to discover that she's really a lesbian. The MPAA initially gave the movie an NC-17 rating.

Moons of Haumea

The dwarf planet Haumea has two known moons, Hi'iaka and Namaka. They are named after the daughters of the Hawaiian goddess of fertility and childbirth, "Haumea". "Hi'iaka" was the goddess of dance, and "Namaka" was the goddess of water and the sea. The two moons were discovered in 2005 by the telescopes at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.

The moons were formed billions of years ago after something crashed into Haumea and broke apart its layer of ice. Hi'iaka, which is about 350 km in diameter, is the largest and outermost moon, has large amounts of ice on its surface. Namaka, which is only one tenth the size, has a strange orbit, affected by the larger moon.

Hi'iaka was discovered on the 26 January, 2005, and was first nicknamed "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer". Namaka was discovered on 30 June, 2005, and was given the nickname "Blitzen the Reindeer." They were given their official names by the International Astronomical Union on 17 September, 2008.

The Bad Girls Club

"The Bad Girls Club" (or "BGC") is an American reality television show. It was created by Jonathan Murray for Oxygen TV channel. The show is about seven women who are called "bad girls" because of their bad behavior. They come from different races and backgrounds. They have psychological and behavior problems. They are put in a big house to live for three months. The production team video tapes their life inside and outside of the house. They live in the house to try and change their "bad ways" and become role models. They have to obey the rules they were given. If they don't follow them, they can be removed from the show. If this happens, a "replacement" will arrive at the house. 

In season one and season two, the premise of the show was different from other seasons. There has been six complete seasons of "The Bad Girls Club". The seventh season is currently airing on Oxygen. The fourth season had the highest ratings. It became the "breakthrough season" for the show. The show is broadcast in five different countries. "The Bad Girls Club" was given negative feedback from television critics. This is because, the show is about girls fighting. Teenagers have also pretended to be like the girls in the show. This made schools in the United States to dislike the show. Some schools even started banning the show in their cities. 

There has been a lot of conflicts about the show. This is because some cast-members stated opinions that made the public very angry. There have been three spin-offs of "The Bad Girls Club". has been a rating success. The show is about three former "bad girls" looking for love. Oxygen released mobile games, comic strip and merchandise to help promote the show. There has been 62 people who been on the show. Kerry Harvick (from the first season) became a country singer. Tanisha Thomas (from the second season) became a host in many "Bad Girls Club" spin-offs. Amber Meade, Amber Buhl, Sarah Michaels, Kendra Jones, Natalie Nunn and Lea Beaulieu were in the "Love Games: Bad Girls Need Love Too" show.

The show follows seven women. They are between the ages of 21 and 27. They live in a big house for three months. The production team video tapes their lives in and out of the house. The girls are called "bad girls". This is because of their bad behavior. However, they are put in the show because they want to change their "bad ways". They also want to become role models to young women. Other "bad girls" are only there to reach goals of their own. In the show, the "bad girls" must try to live with each other. They must also try and deal with a lot of changes from their roommates. They must follow all the rules that they were given. If they break a "bad girl" breaks a rule, she will be removed from the show. A "replacement" is then brought in. A replacement is a "bad girl" who did not enter the house on the first night. She is brought in the show, to fill in. This is because the show is about seven women trying to change. The "bad girls" have to talk in a room about their day. 

Sometimes, a "bad girl" may divide into cliques. Create bad behavior to feel happy, book parties in nightclubs and shop for food. They must also maintain their personal lives. The "bad girls" are allowed to contact their families and boyfriends (or girlfriends). They are given a home computer to communicate with the world. However, watching television and having a cell phone is not allowed. Bullying and double tagging is known to happen in the show. Double tagging means that two or more "bad girls" jump one of their roommates. Sometimes, a "bad girl" may wish to leave the show. This is because of their roommates who are bullying them, being or feeling alone, problems at home, court dates, or because they feel like they are "better" then the girls in the house. 

It is rare if two or more replacements come into the show. The only seasons to have a lot of replacements was season one (2006), season five (2010) and season six (2011). The replacement "bad girl" is always treated badly by the original cast. It is rare if a replacement wants to leave the show. The only season to have a replacement leave was on the fifth season.

This is the "Bad Girls Club" creed. It was first seen in the third season.

The show was different in these two seasons. The age requirements were 21 and 31. "Nicknames" were not given to anyone. Nicknames started in the third season. Season one was the first season to have a lot of replacement "bad girls". Even though this season was different, the rules were kept the same for later seasons. Another thing that stood the same was how the first episode started. The first episode always starts with a physical fight. The fight that is seen, shows how the first "bad girl" is removed from the show.

For the second season, the show began to change. The maximum age requirements to apply dropped from 35 to 27. The cast had to work. They were given jobs that did not give them any money. They had to learn how to be dependent on others for teamwork. They also needed to build a work ethic. This skill would help them in their life after the show. If a "bad girl" wanted to quit her job or did not show up, she would be removed from the show. The girls were given the jobs of planning and decision making. This became the first and only season to have the "bad girls" working. This was also the last time episodes were only 30-minutes long.

The OxygenLive was released on August 3, 2010. This allowed fans of the show to submit their opinions about the season or the cast. Fans had to submit their comments on Facebook or Twitter. Their comments were then showed during the re-cap episode of "The Bad Girls Club". OxygenLive! was an online talk show. Tanisha Thomas (from season two) was the hose. The live show debuted after the first episode of the sixth season aired on Oxygen. The show was about talking with the cast of season six. Thomas gave them questions to answer from fans.

"Viewers" is the estimated number viewers that watched a program either while it was broadcast or watched via DVR on the same day the program was broadcast.

The Bad Girls Club (season 7)

The Bad Girls Club: New Orleans is the seventh season of the reality television series "The Bad Girls Club". Filming began in February 2011 in Kenner, Louisiana and was originally scheduled to premier on July 11, 2011. The premier date was later changed to August 1, 2011. Becoming the second season to be filmed outside of the shows original filming location, season seven's theme is Mardi Grass. 

Oxygen confirmed that there will be a seventh season of "The Bad Girls Club" several weeks before the season finale for season six. The show was called "Bad Girls Club Boot Camp" but was later changed to "Bad Girls Club: New Orleans". Filming started in February 2011 in Kenner, Louisiana. Several weeks later, basketball coach Bryon Scott allowed production at his mansion. Tamithia Shaw, for Interim Code Enforcement (ICE), said "[she] understands the [place] will be used for four months but that pre-production work apparently has been going on for two or three weeks". She also said that the cast was not there. This began to cause an outrage from neighbors.

The cast of season seven were asked to model for the "House of Lounge lingerie" at the New Orleans Fashion Week in March 2011. 

On March 13, 2011, TMZ had announced that "The Bad Girls Club" were not allowed to be at eight clubs because the clubs did not want to be associated with the show's "bad image" (not a good reputation). Season seven's cast were also not allowed at a Mardi Gras party, hosted by Pierre Thomas.

On April 12, 2011 Tasha Malek, one of the cast, had made a complaint about another cast member, Natasia Townsend. Malek told the local police that Townsend was removing her personal items into a garbage bag, while telling her that "she needed to leave the house". This statement outraged Malek as she and Townsend began a physical fight and wrestled to the floor. They were later given summons by the police for disturbing the peace and disorderly conduct.

On May 9, 2011 the following cast were confirmed.

In every season of "The Bad Girls Club", one or more "bad girls" will be asked to leave the house from producers because, of violence, fighting, or they will leave on their own because of stress or family problems. This then gives producers a chance at a new "bad girl" who arrives to the house a day or two to replace the "bad girl" who was removed.

Before the HoH (Head of Household) competition, the houseguests were welcomed to three past dous. The first were Rachel and Brendon (from Big Brother 12). The second were Jordan and Jeff (from Big Brother 11). The last dous were Danielle and Dick (from Big Brother 8). During the HoH competition, the houseguests had to hold onto a banana. They were later squirted with chocolate and whip cream, while being rocked back-and-forth, to make the competition harder. Rachel then won the first HoH competition of the summer and her partner Brendon were safe from being evicted from the game. Host, Julie Chen, told the houseguests that Rachel had to choose only one dou. She was also told that only one of them would be evicted. However, the houseguest who wasn't eliminated can be safe until there are ten remaining houseguests.

Rings of Jupiter

The Rings of Jupiter are a number of rings which circle the planet Jupiter. It was the third set of rings found in the Solar System after the rings found around Saturn and Uranus. The rings are very difficult to see from Earth, needing the most powerful telescopes. They were not discovered until the Voyager 1 space probe visited the planet in 1979. The Galileo space probe carried out more studies in the 1990's. The Hubble Space Telescope and large Earth telescopes have provided information recently.

The ring system is faint and is made mainly of dust. It has four main parts: a thick inner ring known as the "halo" ring, a bright but very thin "main" ring, and two outer, wide, faint "gossamer" rings. These gossamer rings are made from dust from the moons Amalthea and Thebe and have been name after them. They are known as "gossamer" rings because they are transparent, or "see through".

Vulcanoid asteroid

Vulcanoid asteroids are a special group of asteroids which may orbit close to the Sun, closer than the orbit of the planet Mercury. No vulcanoid has ever been discovered; it is not known if they ever existed. Because they would orbit so close to the Sun they could only be seen during twilight, or a solar eclipse. There very small size could make them impossible to see. This part of the Solar System is described as being gravitationally stable, and every other similar stable area has asteroids. If they do exist, vulcanoids would be made of material that would help explain the formation of the planets. If they do not exist, then theories about how the planets were formed might have to change. They are called vulcanoids after a planet, Vulcan, which early astronomers thought they had seen close to the Sun.

A damocloid is an asteroid that takes a long time to orbit the Sun. They are very similar to the periodic comets, like Halley's Comet, but a damocloid does not have a tail like a comet. They are believed to be comets that have lost their volatile material and are dormant. Scientists think that they come from the Oort cloud. This is because some damocloids, such as C/2001 OG (LONEOS), later developed tails and became comets. Some damocloids also orbit in the same direction as comets, which is the opposite direction to asteroids. By January 2010, scientists had found 41 damocloids.

Copy editing

Copy editing or "sub-editing", is the work an editor does to improve the style and accuracy of a text. The text in question should be more readable and sometimes more interesting after the editing.

Copy editing might not involve changing the substance of the text, unless supposed facts need correction. 'Copy' refers to written or typewritten text for typesetting, printing, or publication. Copy editing is done before typesetting and proofreading. Proofreading is the last step in the editorial cycle.

In the United States and Canada, an editor who does this work is called a copy editor, and an organization's highest-ranking copy editor, or the supervising editor of a group of copy editors, may be known as the copy chief, copy desk chief, or news editor. 

In book publishing in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world that follow UK nomenclature, the term 'copy editor' is used, but in newspaper and magazine publishing, the term is sub-editor, commonly shortened to 'sub' or 'subbie'. As the 'sub' suggests, U.K. copy editors usually have less authority than regular editors. 'Editors' in book publishing generally have a responsibility for choosing authors and titles which will make for good sales. In magazines and newspapers they are executives, responsible for the business success of the enterprise.

According to experienced editors, the main things a sub-editor does are: 

Above all, the sub should "approach every story from the point of view of the reader".

If you have an email set in , you should be getting an email from a or changing username clerk explaining how to consent or object to this process. 

If you do not object to being renamed to a new username in order for another user to use the name you currently have, please log in and post a reply here saying so (you may also tell us what username you would like to be renamed to, or we will provide you with a generic one). 

If you do nothing: the request may be done shortly, and your account will be moved to a generic username. You may request that it be moved to a new username of your choice at any time.

If you object to being renamed: please log in and make an edit to this page clearly stating that you object to usurpation. 

Please note that even if your current username is usurped, you can still edit and your data will not be lost; your preferences, watchlist, and other user settings will be transferred to a new username.

This page consists of guidelines as to how process requests at . Renames are a matter of discretion and bureaucrats may choose to disregard the guidelines where there is good reason to do so.



As a pre-note, remember, for usurpations, if "User:xyz" is taking over "User:abc", you must rename ""User:abc"" to ""User:abc (usurped)"" to vacate the abc name for "xyz".



An SUL conflict (or SUL collision) exists when the same name is used on two or more Wikimedia projects by different users.

If a single-user login has not yet been created, the user with the most edits holds the "claim" to the SUL, and other users with the same name will be unable to create an SUL account with that name. If a single-user login has been created, unattached accounts owned by others will hinder cross-project work by the SUL owner. The may be used to check for SUL conflicts and determine the owner or claimholder.

In order to reduce the frequency of SUL conflicts as well as enhance collaboration and foster good will across the various Wikimedia projects, English Wikipedia bureaucrats will typically process requests to "" unused or inactive local accounts made by SUL owners expediently and with relaxed consideration.

For the same reason, bureaucrats will typically decline to process requests by local users that would create new SUL conflicts or have the effect of allowing a local user to take over the claim from an active user on another project, even if the SUL account has not yet been created.

While renames are ultimately subject to bureaucrat discretion, a few rough guidelines are used to determine whether to grant a particular request by a local user where the name already exists on another project:


If the answer to one or more of the above is "yes", the request will likely be declined with a suggestion to gain consent of the other-project user.

<doc id="301221" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=301221" title="Ecological genetics">
Ecological genetics

Ecological genetics is the study of genetics and evolution in natural populations. 

This contrasts with classical genetics, which works mostly on crosses between laboratory strains, and DNA sequence analysis, which studies genes at the molecular level. 

Research in ecological genetics is on traits related to fitness, which affect an organism's survival and reproduction. Examples might be: flowering time, drought tolerance, polymorphism, mimicry, avoidance of attacks by predators. 

Research usually involve a mixture of field and laboratory studies. Samples of natural populations may be taken back to the laboratory for their genetic variation to be analysed. Changes in the populations at different times and places will be noted, and the pattern of mortality in these populations will be studied. Research is often done on insects and other organisms that have short generation times.

Although work on natural populations had been done previously, it is acknowledged that the field was founded by the English biologist E.B. Ford (1901–1988) in the early 20th century. Ford was taught genetics at Oxford University by Julian Huxley, and started research on the genetics of natural populations in 1924. Ford also had a long working relationship with R.A. Fisher. By the time Ford had developed his formal definition of genetic polymorphism, Fisher had got accustomed to high natural selection values in nature. This was one of the main outcomes of research on natural populations. Ford's magnum opus was "Ecological genetics", which ran to four editions and was widely influential. 

Other notable ecological geneticists would include Theodosius Dobzhansky who worked on chromosome polymorphism in fruit flies. As a young researcher in Russia, Dobzhansky had been influenced by Sergei Chetverikov, who also deserves to be remembered as a founder of genetics in the field, though his significance was not appreciated until much later. Dobzhansky and colleagues carried out studies on natural populations of "Drosophila" species in western USA and Mexico over many years.

Many were influenced by Ford in the post WWII era. Collectively, their work on lepidoptera, and on human blood groups, established the field, and threw light on selection in natural populations, where its role had been once doubted.

Work of this kind needs long-term funding, as well as grounding in both ecology and genetics. These are both difficult requirements. Research projects can last longer than a researcher's career; for instance, research into mimicry started 150 years ago, and is still going strongly. Funding of this type of research is still rather erratic, but at least the value of working with natural populations in the field cannot now be doubted.

"Please discuss this request below, but keep in mind that and that there may be options other than "keep" or "delete", such as merging."

1st. I removed the deletion because there was a note saying I can remove it.
2nd. if you didn't find online sites speaking about a prize in Egypt 6 years ago this doesn't mean it didn't happen. I searched for the government web site and found this http://www.scc.gov.eg/ it is in Arabic and Google translate couldn't work with it, however it mentions the name in the year 2006.
3rd. When I wrote "on behalf of him self" I meant I am him. In other terms, i am Ramz Sabry Samy.
4th. for the listed information, you can investigate the mentioned organizations yourself to find out whether they are true or not.
For example; this is the contact us for Fulbright Egypt, please contact them to make sure I am really an Alumni in 2000.

Also please, you could Google my name and you will find many websites mentioning all the information I am listing.
5th. you seem an expert Editor, and frankly I was not aware about the existence of the English version and the Simple English version of the Wikipedia; Could you please explain me the difference and let me know how to transfer my page to the correct one of them?
Waiting for your reply.
Thanks in advance.

Either Way and Peterdownunder, Please advice:
1st: There are many examples of biographies for living persons I know on Wikipedia that are written by themselves.
would you please advice me who can be eligible of writing about me? (for ex. a friend, my wife, my students).
2nd: About proving the information. Not all Egyptian organizations have websites, and if they do, it will be written in Arabic, and Google translate does not apply when the page has Flash. How can I prove awards related to these?
Please be sure that I am not trying to violate rules or abuse Wikipedia, I just lack experience, as Peterdownunder explained, and need your advice for everyone's benefit.
Awaiting your replies.

Primula

Primula is a genus of 400–500 species of low-growing herbs in the family Primulaceae. They include primrose, cowslip and oxlip. 

Many species are grown for their ornamental flowers. They are native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, south into tropical mountains in Ethiopia, Indonesia and New Guinea, and in temperate southern South America.

Perennial primulas bloom mostly during the spring; their flowers can be purple, yellow, red, pink, or white. Generally, they prefer filtered sunlight. Many species are adapted to alpine climates.

The word "primula" is the Latin feminine diminutive of "primus", meaning first (prime), applied to flowers that are among the first to open in spring. 

Primroses are used as food plants by the larvae (caterpillars) of some Lepidoptera species.

Some flowering forms of (cultivated) "Primula" are commonly known as polyanthus ("P. elatior" hybrids) as opposite to primrose ("P.vulgaris" hybrids).

The common primrose, "Primula vulgaris", shows heterostyly. This is a type of morphism with flower forms which differ in the lengths of the pistil and stamens.

The morph phenotype is genetically closely linked to genes responsible for a system of self-incompatibility. That means the pollen from a flower on one morph cannot fertilize another flower of the same morph.

In one morph (termed 'pin') the stamens are short and the pistils are long; in the second morph (termed 'thrum') the stamens are long and the pistils are short. The length of the pistil in one morph equals the length of the stamens in the second morph, and vice versa.

All sections of the genus "Primula" have heterostyle species, altogether 354 species out of 419. Since heterostyly is characteristic of nearly all races or species, the system is at least as old as the genus.

Battle of Canton (1857)

The Battle of Canton (December 28, 1857 - January 1,1858) was a battle of the Second Opium War. The French and English attacked the Chinese city of Canton. The city fell on January 1, 1858 and the Europeans took over.

The Second Opium War was a conflict between England and China. Other Western countries, including the Russian Empire, the United States, and the Second French Empire helped the English. The War began after an event called the ""Arrow" incident." The English used the incident as an excuse to start the war. The Second Opium War is sometimes called the "Arrow War."

The English had several goals in the war. Some of these were:
In 1856, the Qing Dynasty only let foreign merchants trade in certain cities. Goods like tea and silk had to be shipped to those trade cities, and were taxed on the way. The English did not want to pay the extra taxes for shipping things across China.

The Chinese had executed a French missionary named Father August Chapdelaine in Guangxi province. This made the French very angry. The French joined the English in fighting the Chinese.

On October 8, 1856, the Chinese arrested 12 crewmembers of a ship named "Arrow". The Chinese authorities believed that the "Arrow" was smuggling salt. The "Arrow" was owned by Chinese people, but it was registered with the British. Harry Smith Parkes was the British Consul in Canton. He sent a letter to the Chinese Imperial Commissioner (governor), Ye Mingchen. Ye replied that the "Arrow" was a Chinese ship. He claimed that Parkes and the British had no jurisdiction (no right to interfere.) Ye offered to return the arrested sailors, but Parkes refused. Parkes demanded an apology for the insult. Ye replied there was no need for an apology because there way no insult. The British decided that the Supplementary Treaty of the Bogue had been broken. On October 27, 1856, the British Royal Navy attacked Canton.

The first battle of Canton started on October 23, 1856. Three English warships entered the Bocca Tigris (), the waterway that leads to Canton. The English captured the forts that were protecting the city. Ye saw the warships, but did not want to fight them. He moved his navy back away from the English ships.

On October 25, the English navy surrounded the city. Ye ordered all trade with the English to stop.

Admiral Michael Seymour, the commander of the British navy, sent Ye a message on October 27. Seymour demanded that the English be allowed to enter Canton. (Before this, foreigners could not enter the city itself. If they wanted to do business or trade they had to do so in the suburbs or harbor.) Ye did not answer. Seymour ordered his ships to shoot at the government offices. Ye made a declaration that he would pay 30 pieces of silver for each English person killed.

Ye still had not answered on October 28. The English artillery attacked and destroyed the Southern wall of Canton. English soldiers invaded Ye's yamun (office.) The soldiers wanted to capture Ye, but they could not find him. The English occupied (stayed in) Canton for a short while. They had to leave because they did not have enough soldiers or resources to keep control of the city.

When the news sent to London, the English government had a big argument, to start war with China or do not. The disagreement passed by 110:146, the proposal (suggestion) was veto (not to agree the political case). But the English prime minister Palmerston the House of Commons and restarted the election. His party won the election, so the policy passed. The English government ordered (command) Lord Elgin to be a new diplomat with China.

Just in time, the French government said their churchman were killed by the Chinese government. Because the French minister (a man who says what his country said) always had (to be refused), it joined to the English government and sent armies. English and French armies entered into an alliance (become ally, no enemy).

In mid of October, 1857. The English army general had a plan to invade China. They decided to attack from the south of China, Canton. And then they would attack along the North China, to keep moving to Peking. 

Before they go, the Russian minister suggested them, only occupy Canton would not make Qing dynasty give up. The better way was onward to Peking, Qing's dynasty would do. However, the English-French armies still kept their first decision. The decision was attack Canton. Lord Elgin talked with Seymour and the other generals about their plan to Canton. They were really sure they could take (to occupy) Canton.
In November. The English held down the Indian Revolution successfully. Therefore, they had enough armies to China. The alliance army prepared 10,000 soldiers. In Navy, the English army had 43 warships and the French army had 10 ships.

In December 10, 1857. Canton was blocked. On December 12, the alliance army made the last warning to Yeh and new demands as follow:

On December 14, Yeh refused them. After 12 days, The English and French minister sent back and said now their army had the right to do anything. At the same time, the English naval commander sent messages to Yeh, this time, he asked the Qing army must get away from Canton in 90 miles, only in 2 days. Yeh still refused. Over 2 days, they had no action.

On December 27, in the day before the battle. Yeh sent messages to his king, Xianfeng Emperor. He spoke about what happened in Canton, but in lie. In the letter, he was so sure, the English begged for peace, they only wanted the trade with China, said Yeh:
In December 28, the war begun. The alliance army sent troops about 5,500 men and included 700 French soldiers, extra 20 warships. They landed on near Canton, finally, they were so near the city. The alliance army opened fire at governor's office (Yeh's workplace). The Qing army ran away, but Yes was still sitting on his office and reading the paper.

On December 29, the government office finally got destroyed by . The wall of Canton also lost. Until the afternoon at 2 p.m., the battle ended. Successfully, the English-French armies occupied Canton, easily, only 15 killed.

On January 5, after the occupation of Canton. Yeh was not leaving, after that, he got caught in by the English army. The English brought Yeh on their ship to Kolkata, India. He was dead later.

The Brunts School

The Brunts School is a Secondary school in Mansfield, England. It is a performing arts college. The school teaches in drama, music and dance. It used to be a Grammar School and a Technical School. The school started by Samuel Brunts in 1709. One of its former students, Rebecca Addlington, who won two Gold Medals in the 2008 Summer Olympics.

The Brunts School started as Primary/first school in 1687. It had funds of 100 pounds. This was a large amount of money at the time. In 1709, Samuel Brunts' will said that he wanted the local children to "learn an Honest Trade" and get a good job. This led to the Brunts' estate having up with 40 boys and girls learning reading, writing and maths by 1831. The girls also learned knitting and sewing. 60 years later, the estate and the school were combined. In 1891, the school was called Brunts Technical School.

In 1830 "Brunts Charity" owned buildings and land in East Bridgford, Nottingham's marketplace and at Claypool in Lincolnshire. It was the richest of all the Charitable Organizations in Mansfield in 1832. 

A new building was built in 1891. In 1976 Brunts Grammar School became a Secondary/Second school.

The school's students come from several schools known as 'the family of schools'. The list includes King Edward School, Sutton Road School, St Peter's (C of E) School, High Oakham School and Newgate Primary School.

The school's uniform has a green Blazer/jacket. The school colours are green and gold. It's logo is a griffin in its back two legs inside a shield with "[Nil Mortalibus Ardui Est" around the logo. This is the school's Latin motto. It means "Nothing Is Impossible For Humankind".

In 2002, there were nearly 1500 students in the school. Only a small number of the students were aged 16 years or below. The school gained 57% A-C passes. Only a small amount of the students did not pass. This was 5% higher than the England and 10% better than the United Kingdom.

Epidemic typhus

Epidemic typhus is a disease caused by the bacterium "Rickettsia prowazekii". It is one of the diseases known as Typhus, the other is endemic typhus. Sometimes it is mistaken for an unrelated disease with a similar name, Typhoid fever. The disease is spread by lice and fleas. Without treatment, as many as 60% of people who get the disease could die.

The signs of epidemic typhus include:

Sunnyland Slim

Albert "Sunnyland Slim" Luandrew (September 5, 1907 – March 17, 1995) was an American blues pianist from the Mississippi delta. He later went on to Chicago where he became one of the most important piano players in Chicagos blues scene.Sunnyland Slim was one of the most important persons in Chicago blues history, but who really never became a star because he did most of his work as sideman.
He was born on a farm near Vance, Mississippi. He taught himself to play piano and organ and began playing in a local church when he was 14. Soon played in juke joints in the whole delta area. In 1925 he went to Memphis, Tennessee where he played with local musicians like Little Brother Montgomery and Ma Rainey.. There he also got his stage name writing a song about the Sunnyland train which ran between Memphis and St. Louis, Missouri. In 1942 he went to Chicago.

As the electric blues began Sunnyland Slim played with blues musicians like Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Robert Lockwood, Jr., and Little Walter. Muddy Waters partially owed his recording career at Chess Records to Sunnyland Slim who introduced him to the Chess brothers at his own birthday party. His first recording was as a singer with Jump Jackson's band on the Specialty label in September 1946 and his first recording as band leader was in 1947. Between 1948 and 1956 he recorded for Hytone, Opera, Chance, Tempo-Tone, Mercury, Apollo, JOB, Regal, Vee-Jay (unissued), Blue Lake, Club 51, Cobra. In 1988 he was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship. He went on touring and recording till his death in 1995.

The list of the most common words in English has been produced by Oxford University Press.

It is based on an analysis of a body of over a billion words. It represents a study done by Oxford Online, associated with the Oxford English Dictionary. 

This source includes writings of all sorts from "literary novels and specialist journals to everyday newspapers and magazines and from Hansard to the language of chatrooms, emails, and weblogs", unlike some sources which use texts from only specific sources.

"The Reading Teachers Book of Lists" claims that the first 25 words make up about one-third of all printed material in English, and that the first 100 make up about one-half of all written material.

Note that the items listed may represent more than one actual word; they are lemmas. For instance the entry "be" contains within it the occurrences of "are", "is", "were" and "was". Note also that these top 100 lemmas listed below account for 50% of all the words in the Oxford English Corpus.

St Bartholomew's Church, Themar

The parish church St Bartholomew's Church ("German: St. Bartholomäuskirche") is the town church of Themar in Thuringia. It is dedicated to St Bartholomew. It belongs to the most richly equipped churches of the upper valley of the Werra. It is one of the few buildings of the small town, first mentioned in 796, which outlasted all storms of the time. The Oberkirche (upper church) at the upper gate and the Unterkirche (lower church) at the Werra were the first places of worship in the place. Of the Roman Unterkirche there still exist some remainders in the vestry and in both lower floors of the church tower.
Pope Sixtus IV gave permission for the restoration of the church on 14th of May 1484 with countess Margaretha von Henneberg intermediating. 

On 3rd of May 1488 the Chorherr (canon regular) of the Premonstratensian monastery Veßra and minister of Themar Antonius König founded the building of today's church. In 1502 the hall church in late Gothic style was completed.

The Protestant Reformation was introduced to Themar on 5th of October 1544 by the count Ernst von Henneberg. After the Reformation the church received several smaller carved altars from other churches. Since 1541 the church building was frequently converted in the course of the next decades.

The barrel vault and the two matroneums were inserted, whose support beams were decorated with beautiful" Bartmannsköpfe" (sculptures). Similar sculptures can be found in the churches of Rohr and Herpf near Meiningen. 

At the columns the matroneums were decorated with sculptures of saints and apostles , partially from older Gothic altar works and with famous verses from the bible. 

In the choir area there is the valuable "Marienaltar" (altar of St Mary), which was created by Hans Nußbaum from Bamberg about 1510. 

The altar shows in the center Maria with Jesus as a child, to her sides archangel Michael killing the dragon with his lance, and St Bartholomew, the patron of church and town.

On the side panels of the altar there are stations from the life of St Mary: The announcement to the Virgin Mary, the birth of the Lord , the three Magi and the Lamentation of St. Mary by the apostles. At the back of the side panels there are paintings of St Barbara, St Dorothy, St Margaret, St Catherine. On the Predella of the altar is to be seen the Holy Kinship.

Apart from its artistic value the Marienaltar has also great importance for local history: It retained the town church in the Thirty Year's War of being burned down. After the defeat of Sweden in the battle of Nördlingen (1634) general Johann Ludwig Hektor of Isolani, „the commander of all Croats“, plundered the countries of the Thuringian princes.

At 16th of October (Gallustag) in 1634 Themar was burned down (on the same day as Suhl) after the plundering by the Croats. The town church would have been burned as well, but a pious Italian officer gave the order to extinguish the fire when it came near to the Marienaltar.

Further carvings and art treasures are: The shrine of the apostles (about 1500), that is called "„Nasenaltar"" (nose altar) in popular because of the expressive faces of the apostles. 

At the back of the side panels there is a painting of the "Apostelabschied" (Great Commission). At the north wall there is the Wallfahrtsaltar (altar of pilgrimage) one can see the ""Hühnchenlegende"" (miracle of the chicken) of Santo Domingo de la Calzada (on the way of St James) at the back of a side panel.

At the south wall there are a Pietà altar and a Gothic "Mondsichelmadonna", and in the choir area an epitaph in the Renaissance style. Furthermore a fresco painting representing St. Catherine, that was detected in 1934, then the richly decorated Schalldeckel (abat-voix, or sounding-board) of the pulpit that dates from 1644 and an "Epistelstuhl" (reading-desk) likewise from the center of the 17th century and some paintings.

About 1900 stained glass was donated for the windows in the choir area. The pictures show Biblical scenes: the prodigal or lost son, the "Kindersegnung" (benediction of children, St. Luke 18, 15-17), the Good Samaritan. 1972 The last renovation of the St Bartholomew's Church was in 1972.

Originally the organ of the town church was set up in 1851 at the east wall of the church nave by the organ-builders Johann Michel and Wilhelm Holland (from Schmiedefeld am Rennsteig). Three organ stops of the pedal division were taken over from the Weise-organ built in 1629. In 1866 the organ was moved to the extended second matroneum in the west and renewed and reorganized for the last time in the years 1999/2000 by the company Rösel and Hercher.

From 1668 to 1684 Georg Christoph Bach, the oldest uncle of Johann Sebastian Bach, worked as Kantor at the town church and as a teacher at the Latin school of Themar. In 1684 he was appointed to Schweinfurt and became the ancester of the Schweinfurt branch of the Bach family.

The church tower in Renaissance style contains three bells. The oldest bell was cast in 1488, another in 1507. The Bartholomäus bell that was cast in 1520 had to be delivered in 1942. In 1955 a steel bell was put in instead. In the church tower there lived a family of tower guards called Rust up to the fifties of the last century. The three rooms of their flat and the winch which helped to wind up food, water and coal up to the flat are to be still seen there.

Horse training describes what people do to get horses to do particular tasks. This includes training them to let people ride on their backs, or to pull carts and wagons. Horses have to be trained to accept a bridle or a saddle. Historically horses were trained for transport, farm work, warfare and sport. In modern times, sport and recreation are the main reason horses are trained.

There is a lot of argument about horse training. Some methods are now thought to be cruel, and terms like horse breaking are also out of favour.

Proxy murder

A proxy murder is when when a person murders on behalf of someone else. "Proxy" comes from the Latin word "procuratio" which means "to take care of".

An example of this would be an assassin killing for money. Another example would be a person that convinces someone that loves them to kill another person for them. Another example was in prisons where criminals in prison would act as the executioner for people sentenced to death. Lady Betty (1750—1807) was a famous hangwoman and prisoner in the Roscommon Gaol. The Nazis used proxy killings in World War II when they got prisoners to shoot Jewish prisoners instead of doing it themselves. The prisoners were told if they did not do it they would be shot as well.

A documentary movie was made in 2009 looking at mass killings in the US. It is called "Murder by Proxy".

Banded iron formation

Banded iron formations (or BIFs) are a distinctive type of rock often found in (Precambrian) sedimentary rocks. 

They consist of repeated thin layers of iron oxides, either magnetite (FeO) or hematite (FeO), alternating with bands of iron-poor shale and chert. 

Some of the oldest known rock formations, formed over 3,700 million years ago (mya), include banded iron layers. The banded layers are a common feature in sediments for much of the Earth's early history.

The formations are abundant around the time of the great oxygenation event, 2,400 mya. They become become less common after 1,800 mya. 

The total amount of oxygen locked up in the banded iron beds is estimated to be perhaps twenty times the volume of oxygen present in the modern atmosphere. Banded iron beds are an important commercial source of iron ore, such as the Pilbara region of Western Australia and the Animikie Group in Minnesota.

The conventional concept is that the "banded iron" layers were formed in sea water as the result of oxygen released by photosynthetic cyanobacteria. This combined with dissolved iron in Earth's oceans to form insoluble iron oxides. These precipitated out, forming a thin layer on the substrate, which may have been anoxic mud (forming shale and chert). Each band is similar to a varve: the banding is assumed to result from cyclic variations in available oxygen.

It is assumed that the Earth started out with vast amounts of iron dissolved in the world's acidic seas.

Eventually, as photosynthetic organisms generated oxygen, the available iron in the Earth's oceans was precipitated out as iron oxides. 

At the tipping point where the oceans became permanently oxygenated, small variations in oxygen production produced pulses of free oxygen in the surface waters, alternating with pulses of iron oxide deposition.

Greenstone belt

Greenstone belts are large metamorphosed regions of volcanic rocks. The name comes from the green hue of the metamorphic minerals in the rocks. Chlorite, actinolite and other green amphiboles are the typical green minerals.

The rocks are mafic, meaning they are high in magnesium and silica.

Greenstone belts are huge zones which occur in ancient Archaean and Proterozoic cratons between granite and gneiss bodies. A greenstone belt is typically several dozens to several thousand kilometres long. Although composed of a great variety of individual rock units, it is considered a 'stratigraphic grouping' in its own right. Greenstone belts formed at ancient oceanic spreading centers and in volcanic island arcs. 

Greenstone belts are mainly formed of igneous rocks, such as basalt, with minor sedimentary rocks in-between the volcanic formations.

Craton

A craton is the oldest part of a continental plate. It is an old and stable part of the continental lithosphere. 

After surviving cycles of merging and rifting of continents, cratons are usually found in the interiors of tectonic plates. They are composed of ancient crystalline basement rock, which may be covered by younger sedimentary rock. They have a thick crust and deep roots that extend as much as several hundred kilometers into the Earth's mantle.

Cratonic lithosphere is much older than oceanic lithosphere — up to 4 billion years versus 180 million years.

The term "craton" is used to distinguish the stable portion of the continental crust from regions that are more geologically active and unstable. Cratons can be described as shields, in which the basement rock crops out at the surface, and platforms, in which the basement is overlain by sediments and sedimentary rock.

Cratons are subdivided geographically into geologic provinces. A geologic province is an area with common geologic properties.

He came from Illyria (in the Balkans). He suppressed a revolt of Roman mint workers and reformed the coinage to try to avoid the problem of inflation that the Romans had had for a while.
His notable achievements were his defeat several groups of barbarians - most importantly the Alamanni - but also the Goths, Vandals, Juthungi, Sarmatians, and Carpi. He recovered Egypt for the empire. 
He also tried to make the Roman god Sol Invictus the main god.

The first thing he did was fight against the mercenaries that Aurelian used to fight enemies in Asia. These mercenaries were unhappy because the campaign that they had been hired for hadn't happened. They had destroyed several Roman cites in Asia.
He was about to fight the Franks and Alamanni (different Barbarian tribes) in France when he died of fever.

Greater Noida

Greater Noida (GN) (Hindi: ग्रेटर नोएडा, Urdu: بڑا نویڈا, pronunciation: Baṛa Nōēḍā) is in the Gautam Budh Nagar district of the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh (UP). It is under the control of the National Capital Region (NCR) of India. It is about south-east of New Delhi and about south-east of Noida, one of the largest industrial townships in Asia.

The development of Greater Noida is managed by the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA). Greater Noida is a fast growing region.

In the early 1980s, Delhi was growing at a rapid rate. The Government of India planned to develop two new areas around the capital. These residential and industrial areas would reduce the burden on the capital. The two areas were Gurgaon and Noida. Noida's infrastructure and utilities was carefully designed. With the large growth of the Indian economy in the 1990s, Noida became overcrowded.

The government of Uttar Pradesh decided to incorporate the city of Greater Noida. This would be an extension to Noida. The planning of Greater Noida would be improved from what was learned in Noida. Greater Noida is a planned township. Roads are wide with service lanes for every major road. All cabling and utilities are run underground. 

The Buddh International Circuit is currently under construction. It is scheduled to open in 2011. It will host the Indian Grand Prix, a new race to the Formula One schedule. This will be the first F1 race in India.

War novel

A war novel is a novel that takes place during some form of fighting. In these books, the primary action happens during armed combat. Other war novels take place on the home front. The characters may be busy getting ready for or recovering from war. It is sometimes called military fiction.

There have been war novels and other stories about war for many thousands of years. In Ancient Greece and Rome and the Middle Ages, people wrote epic poems about the glory of war. Some of the most famous epic poems are "The Iliad" by Homer, "The Aeneid" by Virgil, the Old English saga "Beowulf", and the legends of King Arthur.

Another important influence of war novels are tragedies (plays about human suffering.) Euripides, Seneca the Younger, Christopher Marlowe, and William Shakespeare wrote plays that are important influences on war novels. Shakespeare's play "Henry V" has many features of a war novel. It has history and military tactics, and it talks about the ethics of war. 

The genres of romance and satire are also important. These works, especially in Early Modern Europe, show military heroism and folly (foolishness). Some important examples are "The Faerie Queen" by Edmund Spenser and "Don Quixote" by Miguel de Cervantes.

The themes and symbols found in modern war novels are also influenced by older works. In "The Inferno", Dante described Hell in a way that is very close to how war is described in war novels. Other influences are John Milton's "Paradise Lost" and the Apocalypse in the "Book of Revelation" in the Bible.

The first war novels were from the 1600s. At that time fiction novels written in prose (instead of poetry) were becoming popular. These early war novels were usually satires and picaresque novels. The soldier was usually a rogue and not very realistic. One example is "Simplicissimus" by Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen. "Simplicissimus" is a semi-autobiographical novel (based on the author's life) about the Thirty Years' War.

Influential war novels from this time include Leo Tolstoy's "War and Peace", about the Napoleonic Wars in Russia, and Stephen Crane's "The Red Badge of Courage", about the American Civil War.
War novels from this time included the experiences of trench warfare, but also began to tell the stories of what happened at home during the war.
Many novels came out of soldiers' and peoples' experiences during World War II. These books were not only by European authors, but also by people around the world.

Just after the war ended, Sakaguchi Ango (坂口安吾) published a book called "Idiocy" (白痴) about the strange life in Japan after the bombing and losing the war. There were many novels aout the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, including: "Summer Flowers" (夏の花) by Hara Tamiki (原 民喜) in 1947 and "Black Rain" (黒い雨) by Ibuse Masuji (井伏鱒二). There were also novels about being part of the kamikaze. The 1949 book "Last Friends" (きけ、わだつみの声) was about a group of soldiers leaving for the front. It was a best-seller. Around 1970 another type of novel began to appear. Ordinary people wrote about their experiences of battles and air raids. Novels about the many different ways the war ended also began to appear and tell being left behind in China or becoming prisoners of the Soviet Union in Siberia.

Many Americans and Vietnamese authors wrote books during or after this long war.

<doc id="301395" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=301395" title="Paleoproterozoic">
Paleoproterozoic

The Paleoproterozoic was the first era of the Proterozoic eon. It came after the Archean eon, and lasted from 2500 to 1600 million years ago (mya).

In the Paleoproterozoic, there was huge production of stromatolites by cyanobacteria. The first unicellular eukaryote organisms also appeared in the fossil record. 

The first supercontinent grew, and some of the rocks were normal sedimentary rocks, not metamorphosed.

Because the Earth was only half as old as now, there were some basic differences from today. Heat in the Earth's interior was greater than today. This was mainly due to the higher abundance of radioactive isotopes, which decay as time passes.

Temperatures at the surface were also higher, due to radiation from the Earth's interior, and due to a methane and carbon dioxide-based greenhouse atmosphere. During the previous eon, the Archean, the oceans were hot (55–85 °C). This was only partly balanced by the fact that the Sun's radiation was lower at that time. 

Paleontological evidence on the Earth's rotational history suggests that ~1.8 billion years ago, there were about 450 days in a year, implying 20 hour days. Further back, the Earth day had about 17 hours, and there were 514±33 days per year. The Earth–Moon distance for the earliest Palaeoproterozoic was 51.9±3.3 Earth radii (compared to 60.27 at present).

A global supercontinent (called Columbia, or Nena) existed from about 1.8 to 1.5 billion years ago in the Paleoproterozoic era.

During the era climate changes were as severe as any in Earth history. From a global high temperature at the start, there were three massive ice ages, with ice deep into the tropics.

There are clear indications that the era saw a drop in atmospheric methane:

Oxygen was produced by the cyanobacteria, but it was mostly used up by chemical sinks. These were the unoxidized sulfur and iron. Until roughly 2.3 billion years ago, oxygen was probably only 1% to 2% of its current level. 

Banded iron formations, which provide most of the world's iron ore, were formed by the oxygen forming compounds with iron; most accumulation ceased after 1.9 billion years ago. Red beds, which are colored by hematite, indicate an increase in atmospheric oxygen after 2 billion years ago; they are not found in older rocks.

There were three major ice ages, with ice deep into the tropics. Undoubtedly, they happened as a result of reduced greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and the rise of oxygen production.

There is what researchers call "a puzzling interval of ~1,400 million years with no verified glaciation between early Palaeoproterozoic glaciations at 2400–2200 mya in North America, South Africa, Scandinavia and Australia and the Neoproterozoic glaciations that affected all continents at 800–600 mya".

There were major bolide impacts during the era, two of which caused the largest impact crators on Earth. There are also three smaller (equal or more than 30 kilometers diameter) in the time zone of 3.0 to 1.2 billion years ago.

The origin of the eukaryotic cell was a milestone in the evolution of life, since they include all complex cells and almost all multi-cellular organisms. The timing of this series of events is hard to determine; Knoll suggests they developed approximately 1.6–2.1 billion years ago. Some acritarchs are known from at least 1650 million years ago, and the possible alga "Grypania" has been found as far back as 2100 million years ago.

Brucellosis is a a disease that is caused by bacteria in the "Brucella" genus. It is also called Bang's disease, Crimean fever, Gibraltar fever, Malta fever, Maltese fever, Mediterranean fever, rock fever, and undulant fever. It is a very contagious disease (can be spread very easily from one person to another.) 

Brucellosis is a zoonosis, a disease that is spread from animals to humans. Humans get the disease by drinking milk that is unsterilized, or by eating meat from sick animals. Sometimes, but not very often, the disease can be spread from human to human.

The disease was first called "Malta fever." British doctors in the military first discovered it in Malta during the Crimean War (1850s). Dr. David Bruce was the first person to discover the bacteria that caused brucellosis.

National Gallery of Victoria

The National Gallery of Victoria is an art gallery and museum in Melbourne, Australia. Started in 1861, it is the oldest and the largest public art gallery in Australia. The main gallery is located in St Kilda Road, at Southbank, with a branch gallery at Federation Square. The St Kilda Road Gallery, designed
by Sir Roy Grounds, opened in 1968. Since December 2003, NGV has operated across two sites – NGV International on St Kilda Road, redesigned by Mario Bellini, and The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia at Federation Square, designed by LAB Architecture Studio.

When the gallery opened, Victoria had been an independent colony for ten years. After the Victorian gold rush, it was easily the richest part of Australia, and Melbourne the largest city. Generous gifts from wealthy citizens, including the industrialist Alfred Felton, made it possible for the National Gallery to start buying large collections of overseas works from both old and modern masters. It has over 65,000 works of art.

The National Gallery of Victoria Art School began in 1867. It was the leading centre for art training in Australia until about 1910. The School’s graduates, such as Sidney Nolan, went on to become some of Australia’s most significant artists.

The Argus (Australia)

The Argus was a morning daily newspaper in Melbourne which started in 1846 and closed in 1957. It was a conservative newspaper for most of its history, but in 1949 became more left in its stories. 

The newspaper was started by William Kerr, a journalist who had worked with the "Sydney Gazette" before moving to Melbourne in 1839 to work on John Pascoe Fawkner's "Port Phillip Patriot". The first edition was published on 2 June 1846.

The paper was known for its abuse and sarcasm and by 1853 Kerr lost ownership after a series of court actions. It was then published under the name of Edward Wilson. The paper was also linked to the weekly "The Australasian" which was to become "The Australasian Post" in 1946.

During the Great Depression in 1933 it launched the "Melbourne Evening Star" in competition with "The Herald" newspaper, but was closed in 1936.

In 1949 the paper was bought by the London based "Daily Mirror" newspaper group. On 28 July 1952 the Melbourne Argus became the first newspaper in the world to publish colour photographs in a daily paper. The paper had interests in radio and in 1956, the new medium of television broadcasting. It wasg part of the group "General Telecasters Victoria" (GTV), and the GTV-9 television station. In 1957 the paper was sold to the "Herald and Weekly Times" group, under the management of Chief Executive Keith Murdoch (Rupert's father), who used the printing presses, but closed the "Argus" and sold off the broadcasting interests. The last edition was on 19 January 1957.

The "Argus" building, built in 1926 on the corner of La Trobe and Elizabeth streets, is classified by the National Trust and is on the Victorian Heritage Register of Heritage Victoria. In 1991, an innovative office building was built next door and named "The Argus Centre", an award winning building by Nonda Katsalidis. In 2004 La Trobe University bought the site of the old Argus building with the intention to redevelop and house legal and business schools in the building, as well as a ground floor shopping precinct.

Newton's Law of Cooling describes how the temperature of an object changes. It states that the rate of change of its temperature depends on how much hotter it is than its surroundings. Since it includes both temperature and the time derivative of temperature, is a first-order differential equation. It was made by physicist Sir Isaac Newton. 

The law requires that the Heat transfer coefficient is independent of the temperature difference between the object and its surroundings. This is the case in some situations, but not in others.

Louis Jordan

Louis Jordan (*July 8, 1908 in Brinkley,Arkansas; † February 4, 1975 in Los Angeles, California) was an American jazz, blues and rhythm & blues musician, songwriter and bandleader. He was most sucessful in the 1940s in the black music market but he reached also white audiences and recorded several cross over hits in the Pop charts.
Louis Jordan was born in Brinkley,Arkansas. His mother, Addie, died in his younger years. His father, James Aron Jordan, was a music teacher and bandleader for the Brinkley Brass Band. From him he got his musical education. He started with the clarinet but also played piano very well.But the alto saxophon became his main instrument. He started his professionel career in the bands of his father. 

He went north to Philadelphia and later to New York, where he started in 1932 with the band of Clarence Williams. In late 1936 he was invited to join the important Savoy Ballroom orchestra led by drummer Chick Webb.Webb was an excellent musician but no great showman, so Jordan took over the announcments when he started singing for the band. Later the young Ella Fitzgerald joined Webbs band and she often sang duets with Jordan. The following years she recorded some hit singles with Jordan. 

1938 Jordan was fired by Webb and he began to form an own band which made her first recordings for Decca in December 1938. The original lineup of the sextet was Jordan (saxes, vocals), Courtney Williams (trumpet), Lem Johnson (tenor sax), Clarence Johnson (piano), Charlie Drayton (bass) and Walter Martin (drums). The Decca recordings were from "The Elks Rendezvous Band" but Jordan changed the name to "Tympany Five" after the brand of Martins drums. The most sucessful time of the band was between 1942 and 1950. In this period they had 18 #1-hits in the Rhythm and Blues chart of Billboard magazine. Some of the hits like Caldonia, Let the good times roll, Saturday Night Fish Fry or Choo Choo Ch'Boogie are evergreens. Under his duet partners were Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong.

In the 1950s his singles did not sell very well so he left Decca. He signed with different other record companies but was not as sucessful as in the 1940s. He died in 1975 in Los Angeles and is buried in St. Louis, Missouri. 

In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked him #59 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. He was introduced to the Rock and Roll Hall of fame. There he is described as “the Father of Rhythm & Blues” and “the Grandfather of Rock ‘n’ Roll.”As jump blues artist he paved the way for Roy Brown, Wynonie Harris, Tiny Bradshaw and others. In his music one can hear the prototype of Rock and Roll. He influenced Bill Haley & His Comets, whose producer, Milt Gabler, had also worked with Jordan. The Broadway show, "Five Guys Named Moe", was devoted to Jordan's music and this title is given to both soundtrack (tribute) and original music collections. The show was played over 400 times on Broadway. Blues Guitarist B. B. King recorded an album called "Let The Good Times Roll-The Music of Louis Jordan", as well as the songs "Let the Good Times Roll" and "Caldonia". Rock singer Joe Jackson recorded Jumpin' Jive in 1981 which featured several songs by Jordan. Let The Good Times Roll, a Jordan biography, was written by British jazz historian John Chilton.

The music of Louis Jordan is still available in many different collections. To learn more about his music one can buy Bear Familys nine-CD collection of Jordan's work ("Let the Good Times Roll: the Complete Decca Recordings 1938-1954"). Another collection is Proper Records low priced four-CD, 102-track compilation ("Jivin' With Jordan") that includes all of Jordan's important songs from his Decca years.

Cleaner fish

Cleaner fish are fish that provide a service to other fish species by removing dead skin and ectoparasites. This is an example of mutualism, an ecological interaction that benefits both parties. 

A wide variety of fishes show cleaning behaviors. They include wrasse, cichlids, catfish, and gobies, as well as by a number of different species of cleaner shrimp. 

There is also at least one predatory mimic, the sabre-toothed blenny. It mimics cleaner fish but in fact bites off pieces of fin.

<doc id="301524" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=301524" title="Blenny">
Blenny

A blenny is a member of a large suborder of teleost fish called the Blennioidei. The suborder has about 833 species in 130 genera.

Blennies are generally small fish. They have long bodies (some almost eel-like), and relatively large eyes and mouths. Their dorsal fins are continuous and long. The pelvic fins have a single embedded spine, and are short and slender. The tail fin is rounded. 

The blunt heads of blennies often have whisker-like structures called "cirri". As generally benthic fish, blennioids spend much of their time on or near the sea floor.

They are quite similar in form to some gobies.

Wrasse

The wrasses are a family, the Labridae, of marine fish, many of which are brightly coloured. The family is large and diverse, with over 600 species in 82 genera.

They are typically small fish, mostly less than long, although the largest, the Humphead wrasse, can measure up to . 

They are efficient carnivores, feeding on a wide range of small invertebrates. Many smaller wrasses follow the feeding trails of larger fish, picking up invertebrates disturbed by their passing.

Wrasses can put their jaws forwards, usually with separate jaw teeth that jut outwards. 

Many species can be recognized by their thick lips. The inside of these lips is curiously folded, which gave rise the German name of "Lippfische". The dorsal fin has 8–21 spines and 6–21 soft rays, usually running most of the length of the back. 

Wrasse are sexually dimorphic. Many species are capable of changing sex. Juveniles are a mix of males and females (known as Initial Phase or IP individuals) but the largest adults become territory-holding (Terminal Phase or TP) males.

The word "wrasse" comes via Cornish from the Welsh word "gwrach" meaning an old woman or hag.

The Neoproterozoic era lasted from 1,000 to 542.0 ± 1.0 million years ago (mya). 

In the first period, the Tonian, the global supercontinent Rodinia broke up into separate land masses.

In the second period, the Cryogenian, the Earth had two great ice ages, the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations. These ice ages were so severe they are sometimes called Snowball Earth.

In the third period, the Ediacaran, the earliest fossils of multicellular organisms are found, the Ediacaran biota.

Teasel is a plant in the genus Dipsacus. There are about 15 different species of teasel. These flowering plants are tall and leafy (herbaceous). They are biennial plants and are native to (come from) Europe, Asia, and northern Africa. They can grow to be tall.

These plants have a prickly stem and leaves. Its flowers are purple, dark pink, or lavender and grow directly on the end of the stem. After flowering, the head of the plant dries out and holds small seeds. These seeds are important food in the winter for birds, especially the European Goldfinch. Teasels are grown in gardens and nature reserves to attract these goldfinches.

In the United States, teasel is an invasive species. It is not native to the continent and takes over the land of native plant species. 

Some of the most common species of teasel are:

Hypersexuality, also known as nymphomania, is a strong urge to have sexual intercourse. Masturbation causes euphoria (extreme pleasure). The causes of this condition are still unknown. Some psychologists think it is caused by a hormone imbalance. Others believe it is caused by early exposure to pornography and sex. 

This disorder is associated with schizophrenia. Most pedophiles, who have too much testosterone, suffer from this.

The writing that is created by free writing is raw and unusable. The process is sometimes used by writers to overcome writer's block, apathy, and self-criticism. It is mostly used by writing teachers and people who write prose (not poetry.)

It is sometimes thought to be a kind of brainstorming. In brainstorming, the writer lists ideas and possibilities. In free writing, the writer writes sentences to make paragraphs.

Cleaner shrimp is a generic term for any swimming decapod crustacean that cleans other organisms of parasites. This is an example of symbiosis: Both parties benefit. The fish benefit because they have parasites removed, and the shrimp gain the nutritional value of the parasites. In many coral reefs, there are cleaning stations, with many cleaning shrimps.

This behaviour is similar to that of cleaner fish. Sometimes, cleaer shrimp join cleaner wrasse and other cleaner fish.

Cleaner shrimp are often included in salt water aquaria to keep the tank clean.

Mimosa is a genus of plants. It includes around 400 different species of herbs and shrubs. It is classified in the subfamily Mimosoideae of the legume family Fabaceae. The word "mimosa" comes from the Greek word that means "mimic". 

The best known species of mimosa are "Mimosa pudica" and "Mimosa tenuiflora". "Mimosa pudica" is found in Central and South America. When touched or heated, it folds its leaves. "Mimosa tenuiflora" is used by shamans (traditional magical healers.) It is used in ayahuasca brews (a "magic" drink) because of the psychedelic drug DMT in its roots.

The "Mimosa" genus has gone through many periods of time where it was split up into smaller groupings or lumped into larger ones. It has over 3,000 names to describe it and its species. Most of these names are now considered synonyms. Some of the names have been given to other species and genera.

Because of this, the name "mimosa" has been used for other species that look like mimosa but are not related. Some of the most common unrelated plants with this name are the Silk Tree ("Albizia julibrissin") and Sattle ("Acacia dealbata".)

This genus includes some plants that are able to move fast. This is very rare. The mimosa's leaves close quickly when touched.

"Mimosa" is related to the genera "Acacia" and "Albizia". The difference between them is that the mimosa's flowers have ten or fewer stamens. The big round flower of the mimosa is actually an inflorescence, a cluster (close group) of many small flowers.

Denke was born in Münsterberg, Silesia in the Kingdom of Prussia (now Ziębice in Poland.) There is not a great deal of information about his early life. As an adult he was well liked in his community. He worked as an organ player at the local church.

On December 20, 1924, Denke was arrested after attacking a man at his house with an axe. Police searched Denke's home and found human flesh in huge jars of curing salts. A ledger (record book) contained the details of 30 people Denke had murdered and cannibalized (eaten) over the years. Police thought he sold the flesh of his victims at the Breslau (today's Wrocław) market.

The day after his arrest, Denke hanged himself in his cell. His exact motives are unknown and can only be guessed at.

Taglish and Englog

Taglish and Englog are the names of the mixed language family that developed in Manila from the of English and Tagalog languages, the common languages of the Philippines. Three languages based on it exist: Coño English, Jejenese, and Swardspeak.

Taglish and Englog are used by Filipinos in countries like Australia, Canada, the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom. It used in text messages to write more quickly.

Taglish (or Englog) is a language of Manila created by mixing the English and the Tagalog languages together. The language is used because Tagalog words are longer than words in English. Example:
English action words, and even some naming words, can be Tagalog action words. This is done by the addition of one or more prefixes or infixes and by the doubling of the first sound of the starting form of the action or naming word. 

The English action word "drive" can be changed to the Tagalog word "magda-drive" meaning "will drive" (used in place of the Tagalog word "magmamaneho"). The English naming word "Internet" can also be changed to the Tagalog word "nag-Internet" meaning "have used the Internet".

Taglish and Englog also use sentences of mixed English or Tagalog words and phrases. The conjunctions used to connect them can come from eany of the two. Some examples include:

Because its informal nature, experts of English and Tagalog discourage its use.

Coño English (tl: "Konyo") or Colegiala English (es: ) is a creole of Taglish and Englog that originated from the children in rich families of Manila. The word "coño" itself came from the Spanish word "coño". It is a form of Philippine English that has Spanish and Tagalog words. Unlike other forms of Taglish and Englog, Coño English sounds more gentle and feminine.

The most common aspect of Coño English is the building of action words using the English action word "make" with the base form of a Tagalog action word. Examples:

Sometimes, Tagalog interjections such as "ano", "naman", "pa", "na" (or "nah"), "no" (or "noh"), "a" (or "ha"), "e" (or "eh"), and "o" (or "oh") are placed to add emphasis. 

"No" and "a" (from the Tagalog word "ano") are used for questions and are added to the end of a sentence only. "Ano" (meaning "what") is also used for questions and is placed in the front or the end.

"E" (added to answers to questions) and "o" (for statements) are used for exclamations and are added to the front only. "Pa" (meaning "not yet", "not yet done", "to continue", or "still") and "na" (meaning "now", "already", or "already done") can be placed in the middle or end. "Naman" (same as "na" but mostly for emphasis only) is placed anywhere.

The interjection "no?" (equal to the Spanish "¿no?" and the German "nicht?") is pronounced as or (with a pure vowel instead of the English glide), which shows influence from Spanish.

English description words are often replaced with Tagalog action words. The language also has many Spanish words or Spanish words like "baño" ("bathroom"), 
"tostado" ("toasted") and "jamón" ("ham").

Due to the feminine sound of Coño English, male speakers sometimes overuse the Tagalog word "pare" (which means "pal" or "buddy"), in order to make it sound more masculine. Sometimes "tsong" (whose meaning is the same) is used instead of "pare" or with it.Examples below:

Kusunoki Masashige

Kusunoki was a brilliant tactician and strategist. He defended two key Loyalist fortresses at Akasaka and Chihaya. This helped Go-Daigo to briefly return to power. However, one of the loyalist generals, Ashikaga Takauji, betrayed Go-Daigo. Ashikaga led an army against Kusunoki and the remaining loyalists. Kusunoki suggested to the Emperor that they hide on sacred Mount Hiei and allow Takauji to take Kyoto. Later, they could move quickly down from the mountain to trap Ashikaga and destroy him.

Go-Daigo would not leave the capital. He insisted that Kusunoki meet Ashikaga's larger army forces in the field in a direct battle. Kusunoki obediently accepted his Emperor's foolish command. This became a great example of loyalty. He left his death poem with his young son Masatsura and knowingly marched his army into almost certain death. The battle took place at Minatogawa in modern-day Chūō-ku, Kobe. It was a tactical disaster. Kusunoki had only 73 of the original 700 horsemen left and was surrounded. He committed suicide along with his brother Masasue, 11 close clan members, and 60 others. According to legend, his brother's last words were "Shichisei Hōkoku!" (七生報國; "Would that I had seven lives to give for my country!") and Kusunoki Masashige agreed.

Kusunoki Masashige's son, Kusunoki Masatsura, served the next emperor, the 12-year old Go-Murukami. These two had a trusting relationship like their fathers. Masatsura died alongside his brother Masatoki and cousin Wada Takahide in battle. That was the end of the Kusunoki clan.

Kusunoki Masashige's successful defense of Chihaya castle is believed to have helped the emperor gain power against the Kamakura bakufu. Kusunoki held out so long in his castle, so Ashikaga Takauji changed sides and helped the emperor. The Kamakura bakufu ended. However, Ashikaga Takauji quickly learned that he did not like following the emperor's commands. He changed loyalty again and established his own Ashikaga bakufu. He was able to establish his own shogunate after defeating Kusunoki Masashige and the commander in chief Yoshisada in the final battle. Kusunoki Masashige tried to bring Ashikaga Takauji back to the emperor's side, but the emperor rejected this plan.

Polymerase chain reaction

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a way to copy a sequence of DNA. This is done in a lab, using an enzyme called DNA polymerase. It is called chain reaction because the result of one cycle is used immediately for the next cycle. This allows exponential growth to happen. 

PCR has many uses in a biological or biochemical setting. Basically it is done for sequence analysis of the DNA. In turn, this allows recognition of birth defects, identify virus infections, or tell whether two people are related. 

This process was developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis. He was not the first person to find the PCR process, but he was the first to make the process usable. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Michael Smith for their work in the PCR process.

The method consists of repeated melting and cooling for DNA melting and replication of the original DNA, also called a template. Short DNA fragments consisting of DNA sequences complementary to the template and a DNA polymerase, an accelerator, are key material for selective and repetitive steps.eps

The technique proceeds in three steps:
Initiation.
Elongation.
Termination.

Jejemon

A Jejemon (tl: ) is a type of person in the Philippines who makes the English language hard to read. The "Philippine Daily Inquirer" call them different but happy because of their language and clothes.

The word "Jejemon" came from people who like to write "hehehe" as "jejeje" because "jeje" is from Spanish or because the letters "h" and "j" are beside each other. "-Mon" is added at the end. This is from the Japanese anime Pokémon. "-Mon" means "monster." They are "jeje-monsters."

Jejemons started to appear because of cellphones. Cellphones can only use 160 characters so people who use them write shorter words to save space. Jejemons don't want this so they made their words longer. Most Jejemons are poor. 

People who are Jejemons are described based on levels. These are "mild," "moderate", "severe", or "terminal."

Jejemons speak Jejenese based on Taglish and Englog. Their alphabet, Jejebet, is based on Leet. Words are created by mixing letters in a word, mixed large and small letters, using the letters H, X or Z many times, and mixing of numbers in words. The spelling is the same as Leetspeak.

Miyagi Prefecture

Miyagi Prefecture used to be part of Mutsu Province. That province was in the northern part of Honshu. It was made from land taken from the indigenous Emishi. The province became the largest as it expanded to the north. The ancient capital was in modern Miyagi Prefecture.
During the Sengoku period various clans ruled different parts of the province. Date Masamune was a close ally of the Tokugawa. He established Sendai, which is now the largest town of the Tōhoku region.

In the Meiji period, four new provinces were created from parts of Mutsu: Rikuchū, Rikuzen, Iwaki, and Iwashiro. In 1871, Sendai Prefecture was formed. It was renamed Miyagi prefecture the following year.

On March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and major tsunami hit Miyagi Prefecture. It caused major damage to the area. The tsunami was about 10 meters high in parts of Miyagi Prefecture.
There are thirteen cities in Miyagi Prefecture:

These are the towns and villages in each district:
‡ Scheduled to be dissolved following mergers.

Agriculture, fishing, and sake brewing are all important in Miyagi. As of March 2011, the prefecture produced 4.7% of Japan's rice, 23% of oysters, and 15.9% of saury fish. But, manufacturing around Sendai is a larger part of the economy. The area produces electronics, appliances, and processed food.





Sendai was the castle town of the daimyo Date Masamune. The remains of Sendai Castle are on a hill above the city.

Miyagi Prefecture has one of Japan's Three Great Views. Matsushima Bay is full of small islands with old pine trees on them. Many visitors come here every year and many artists have painted the islands.

<doc id="301847" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=301847" title="Holy Snakes">
Holy Snakes

The phenomenon of the Holy Snakes of the Virgin Mary has been occurring for centuries during the festivities to the Theotokos between August 5 and August 15 in the village of Markopoulo on the island of Kefalonia, Greece. The small black snakes appear at the church of "Panagia of Langouvarda" on the site of a monastery, established as a nunnery and dedicated to "Our Lady of Langouvarda". 

The myth about these snakes is attached to the year the monastery was attacked by pirates in 1705. The nuns prayed fervently to the Virgin Mary for protection and were subsequently transformed into the snakes to avoid being taken as prisoners.

The snakes have a small cross on their head and their tongues are also in the shape of a cross. They are known to belong to the "Telescopus fallax" species, also known as the "European Cat Snake", and they appear in and around the courtyard of the church, on the walls and on the bell tower. The snakes show no fear while the services are held and are harmless during the festivities. As soon as the Liturgy concludes on the 15th of August, they become hostile and aggressive and disappear back into the wilderness of the area. The snakes cannot be found until the following year.

The inhabitants of the villages consider them to be holy, collecting them and setting them on the silver icon of the Virgin of the Snakes ("Panagia Fidoussa"). It has been documented by the locals that during World War II and the year of the island's destructive 1953 earthquake in August, the snakes failed to appear. The locals now use this as a sign that if the snakes do not show just before the 15th of August that something bad is imminent.

Also on the island of Kefalonia at a different church on May of each year, women of the island pick lilies and place them on the icon of the Virgin Mary. Once a flower is cut and its stem is completely dry it can not bud again, but these dried lilies, on the 15th of August fully blossom again, they don't begin the blossoming on the previous days, but they begin and reach the full blossom on the 15th.

Kallima

Kallima, also known as the Oakleaf or Dead leaf butterflies, is a genus of butterflies of the family Nymphalidae. They are found Asia. 

Their common name is a reference to the under surface of their wings, which is various shades of brown. When the wings are held closed, this results in a remarkable similarity to a dead leaf. There are dark dots or patches which look like the effects of fungi and lichen, which are so common on dead leaves. 

The camouflage is perfected by the rear wings, which have a little 'tail', which looks like the stalk of a leaf. When at rest in closed position, the 'tail' touches the branch, completing the illusion.

There are two morphs of the common Indian species "Kallima inachus". Nothing seems to be known about why these morphs exist. There is also variation in the colour of the under surfaces.

<doc id="301925" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=301925" title="Impression management">
Impression management

Impression management is an idea spoken about in the discipline of sociology. It is about the experience in everyday life where people control the way that they appear to others. People do this by selecting certain gestures, speech patterns, feminine or masculine expressions, as well as certain expressions of class and cultural interest. This so that people can give a particular image to others about who they want to be and how they want to be seen.

When gesturing a person might use reserved and minimal movements in a professional setting, whilst they may smile widely and wave about when with friends. A person might also change their speech pattern in a professional setting in order to sound more educated or refined, and may speak more casually or use swear words when in a casual setting. 

Males and females also often control how they are perceived in terms of masculinity or femininity. Boys and men might sometimes make their voices sound deeper or speak in short sentences to reflect an old stereotype that males are unfeeling and unconcerned with self-expression. Females on the other hand might feel the need to speak in line with the speech patterns of their peers, and this may include tacking on culturally specific phrases like "or whatever" and "that's hot/cute" to indicate they identify with the female gender and traditional interests. These of course are very simple ideas about what it means to be a man or woman. In contemporary life the border between male and female is sometimes becoming less strict. In Western societies psychologists support that people who show alternative gender expression are still medically normal.

People also talk about what kind of music they are interested in, what kind of movies they like to watch, and what kind of places they like to visit in order to give people an idea of where they stand in relation to class and culture. A common distinction in contemporary youth culture is the listening to so called "indie" alternative or independent music as opposed to pop or popular music. Similarly someone might say they like watching highbrow French films or award winning films, as opposed to something more mass culture, like a Disney movie.

Boxer Rebellion

The Boxer Rebellion was a war that happened in China between 1899 and 1901. 

Main Articles: Opium Wars, First Sino-Japanese War

It happened during a time when many foreign countries were dominating China. These were countries like Japan, Britain, Germany, and Russia. China had lost many wars to these countries and were being humiliated by them. 

The Boxers were angry Chinese people who went around killing foreigners and Chinese people who helped foreigners. The Boxers got a lot of people to help them and went to Peking (Beijing) to kill all of the foreigners.

Japan, Russia, Britain, France, the United States, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy made an alliance to keep the Boxers out of their part of the city. While they did that, the Empress Dowager Cixi declared war on all of them and sent the Chinese Army to help the Boxers. They fought for 55 days before the foreign reenforcements got through and defeated the Chinese. Afterwards there was a celebration, and foreign soldiers ran around stealing from the people and raping Chinese women. Their commander heard about it and was angry, but they kept doing it anyway.

The foreigners were very angry with the Chinese. They said that China had to pay them even more money and give them more land. They also said China had to execute every Boxer. China had to agree, and the foreigners got what they wanted. A few years later in 1911, the Qing Empire collapsed and China had a new government, but the foreigners still influenced China, especially Japan.

Hi, I would like to request sysops. I am an admin mainly active on Meta, among other non-content wikis as well as a crat on strategy wiki. I have several hundred logged actions on strategy and meta. I started on english wikipedia, where I have rollback and reviewer permissions. Lately, I found I don't have a lot to contribute to english wikipedia. I found simple english wiki last year and really like the community here, it's much smaller than en.wp. I am available on IRC and available for most of the day, I think if I had admin rights here I could be especially of use, since I am in a different time zone when not a lot of other admins are available. I want to contribute to a content project and would really like to work on simple english wiki besides my work on Meta. I am also an OTRS volunteer, member of SWMT and active in several other projects across Meta.

If there are any concerns if I would remain active here as an admin, I would point to my record on strategy wiki where I have remained active for several years even during times when there were less than 10 edits in a month.

List of characters in the Camp Half-Blood series

This is a list of characters in the Percy Jackson & the Olympians and The Heroes of Olympus series.

Perseus "Percy" Jackson is a son of Poseidon and is the protagonist and narrator of the series. Being a child of one of the "Big Three" (Zeus, Hades, Poseidon), Percy is the hero referred to within the prophecy of the Oracle, which foretells that the next half-blood child of the "Big Three" to reach the age of sixteen would have to make a decision that would mean the destruction or saving of Olympus.

Annabeth Chase is a daughter of Athena. So, she is very intelligent. She is fascinated with architecture. In battle, she is a skilled enough fighter to fight along with Percy. She is very good in strategy. She ran away from home when she was seven and met Luke and Thalia, who took her with them to get to Camp Half-Blood. She aids Percy in four of his five quests and is captured in one of them.

Grover Underwood is a satyr and Percy Jackson's best friend. He has found the four most powerful demigods of the century: Percy Jackson (son of Poseidon), Thalia Grace (daughter of Zeus), and Nico and Bianca di Angelo (children of Hades). Before his death, Pan (the god of nature) says Grover is the bravest satyr ever to be. He names Grover as his successor to carry on his word to protect the wilderness. The Council of Cloven Elders is angered by this choice. He is the boyfriend of the tree nymph Juniper. But in "The Last Olympian" he is chosen as a replacement for Leneus (another Satyr who died in battle) on The Council of Cloven Elders after showing bravery on the battlefield.

Tyson is a Cyclops, the son of Poseidon and his mother is unknown. Technically he is not a demigod, but at camp he resides in Percy's cabin, and is considered to be Percy's brother. He first appears in "The Sea of Monsters" as a homeless boy. He is afraid of Grover while Grover is also afraid of him. Also in "The Sea of Monsters" he was Percy's best friend and was always picked on. At the end of the book, he gets to go to work for his father, Poseidon, in the Underwater Armory.

Nico di Angelo is a son of Hades, Bianca's younger brother and Percy Jackson and Thalia and Jason Grace's cousin. At first Percy assumed Hades broke the oath not to have children after World War II, but Nico and his sister Bianca had been placed in the Lotus Casino, where 'time stands still' since before the oath was made. At the time, he took great interest in a game called Mythomagic. Nico has the power to raise skeletal warriors, shadow travel, and create great fissures in the ground that swallow up anyone or anything unfortunate enough to be standing on it at the time. For a time, he was Percy's enemy, blaming him for the fact that he had failed to protect Bianca as he had promised, but they became friends eventually. Nico tried multiple times to contact his sister and had difficulty contacting her, even using his dreams. Nico refused to stay at Camp Half-Blood in the fourth book after noting that he was not welcomed at Camp Half-Blood; he compares this to the fact that his father is not welcomed at Olympus. Several months later, he informed Percy of a plan that could lead to defeating Kronos. In the final book, he convinced Percy to bathe in the River Styx, making him invincible barring the small of his back. In the end of the final book Percy makes all the gods and goddess to 'claim' all their children and make sure they have cabin's in Camp Half-blood. Nico goes back to the camp and makes a cabin for himself and all the other minor gods and goddess.

Thalia Grace is a daughter of Zeus. She is Jason's older sister and the cousin of Percy Jackson and Bianca and Nico Di Angelo. Grover Underwood was assigned to watch over her when she ran away from home at ten years old. On her journey, she met Luke Castellan and Annabeth Chase. They also had brief encounters with the Hunters of Artemis and she was enticed to join by Zoë Nightshade. When she was twelve, they were all soon attacked by a herd of monsters and caught by a Cyclops in New York. She was captured, but thanks to Annabeth, was freed. They meet the satyr Grover Underwood on the way. They escaped, but found that the monsters they had briefly escaped caught up to them. As they reached Half-Blood Hill, Thalia sent Luke, Grover, and Annabeth over the boundary line while she faced the monsters. She sacrificed her life for her friends, and her father, Zeus, took pity on her and transformed her to a pine tree. She is later brought back to life by the Golden Fleece and joins the quest in the third book where she ultimately joins the Hunters, taking the place of Zoë Nightshade. She has a younger brother, Jason Grace who was separated from her when she was 10. This became the reason she ran away from home.She wears a lot of dark makeup and punk style clothing. She has electric blue eyes and spiky black hair. She is so like Percy that according to Annabeth, they either could be best friends... or worst enemies.

Luke Castellan is one of Hermes's children and a major antagonist of the series. Though initially the counselor of Cabin 11 and an ally to Percy, he revealed his true nature as a high-ranking member of Kronos's army by attempting to kill Percy at the end of "The Lightning Thief", and on several occasions afterward. He is shown to harbor a great bitterness towards the gods (particularly his father, Hermes) for what he regards as abandonment. His mother had been driven crazy upon attempting to become the Oracle, leading to a stressful childhood. After reforming, Kronos does not need Luke's assistance. However, in his duel with Percy on Mount Olympus, striking Annabeth reminds him of his promise to protect her. This temporarily frees him from Kronos's influence. Percy makes his choice to give Luke Annabeth's knife, and Luke, cursed by the broken promise, kills himself by stabbing his own Achilles heel to destroy Kronos. This fulfills the prophecy, with Luke being the foretold hero. In the film, Luke is portrayed by Jake Abel.



































Some of the known characters of Greek Mythology have made an appearance in this series:




Percy is one of the few demigods whose last name does not reflect his godly parent, though his first name does. Many of the campers at Camp Half-Blood have last names that consist of a traditional role or trait of their parent. Other last names are often commonplace: Rodriguez, Nakamura.

Operant conditioning

Operant conditioning is a form of learning. In it, an individual changes some of its behaviour because it associates this behaviour with a stimulus. Operant conditioning is different from classical conditioning. Operant conditioning deals with the voluntary modification of behaviour; classical conditioning with training a reflex. 

The terms used are:

There are four different contexts in operant conditioning. Note that in the following, "positive" simply means that something is added, and negative that something is taken away:

Atrax

Spiders of the genus Atrax have very strong venom. They aggressively defend their territory and chase off attackers who may scare them by making a threat display. Next they will bite. The fastest death occurred in 1927 when a young boy died within fifteen minutes of being bitten. Thirteen deaths were recorded in the fifty years before antivenom was invented for this spider's bite. In English they are sometimes called Sydney Funnel Web spiders because they come from around that part of Australia.

Threat display

A threat display is anything that an animal does to scare away other animals. A dog will bare its teeth and growl. A cat will hiss. A snake will coil up, raise its head, and move back and forth to point itself at any big animal that approaches it. 

Many animals have threat displays that make them look bigger. A lion's mane will stand up, making it look much larger and more powerful. Humans may raise both hands, spread wide, above their heads. Bears will stand on their hind legs, raise their front legs, and show their teeth while growling.

Antivenom

An antivenom is a medicine used to protect against a specific venom. (A venom is a toxin released by a snake or insect.) Frequently the venom of some creature such as a cobra will be harvested and a little will be injected using a hypodermic needle into a horse every day for a long time. The horse's body will develop an immunity to the venom, so more and more venom from the snake can be injected every day. After the horse is immune, its blood can be drawn little by little to get the part of the blood that makes the horse immune. That part can then be injected into humans who have been bitten by cobras.

China at the Olympics

The People's Republic of China (PRC) was first at the 1952 Summer Olympics. That year, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) let both the PRC and the Republic of China (which recently moved to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War) to compete. The Republic of China withdrew in protest. Because of the political status of China, the PRC was not in the Olympics again until 1980. 

The Chinese Olympic Committee was formed in 1910 and recognized in 1979. Before the Chinese Civil War, athletes competed as the Republic of China (ROC) at the Olympics. In 1979, the International Olympic Committee passed a resolution for the ROC team to be designated "Chinese Taipei", and this opened the door for the PRC to finally join the Olympic movement.

Hong Kong has had a distinct National Olympic Committee since 1950 and has been at the Games since 1952. After the territory returned to the PRC this has continued, with Hong Kong separate from the rest of the nation under the name "Hong Kong, China".
