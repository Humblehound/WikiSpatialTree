Castrato

A castrato (plural castrati) was a type of male singer with a very high voice. The effect was produced either through castration, or because of some hormonal problems. The world "castrato" literally means castrated. Such singers were very sought after in the early days of the opera. Most of the main soprano roles in operas by Handel and other composers of that time were written for castrati. Nowadays they are almost always sung by female sopranos - there are no castrati left. 

The practice of castrating young boys who had good singing voices was quite common in Italy in the 17th century. When castration is done before puberty, the usual effects of puberty will not happen. These include the vocal chords enlarging and growing bigger, and the voice getting deeper as a consequence. 

Even though castration was illegal in many parts of Italy, it was often performed. Many families who were poor had their children castrated because it might give them a better future. 

Once a boy was castrated he would go to a special music school where children learned singing and musical instruments. The castrati pupils were given special treatment. They were fussed over and kept warm to stop them from getting colds. When they grew up they hoped to become famous opera singers. A few of them had very successful careers in opera. They were the great stars of their day, and audiences came to the opera to cheer on their favourite singers. Those who were not good enough to make a career in opera joined church choirs instead.

It is impossible now for us to know what these great castrato voices sounded like, but they must have had very powerful voices and many of the singers were very skilled in singing and adding musical ornamentation to the songs. In the 18th century Italian opera became very popular in England. This was largely due to the German-born composer Georg Friderich Händel who moved to England in 1709 and wrote lots of Italian operas. Many singers who sang in London came from Italy, and many were castrati. The most famous one was called Farinelli. 

The popularity of castrato singers died out in the 19th century when operas became less artificial and more like real life. By the mid-19th century they were no opera castrati left, although a few castrati still sang in church choirs. The last one, a man called Alessandro Moreschi, died in 1922 aged 64. There is a recording of his voice made in 1902 which can be heard online, but he may not have been a good singer and he was old when he made the recording, so we cannot judge whether the castrato voice was beautiful by that recording.

<doc id="34142" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34142" title="Falsetto">
Falsetto

A falsetto voice is a special way of speaking or singing. If a man tries to imitate a woman’s voice he does it by speaking in a falsetto voice. When a man sings with a falsetto voice it sounds high like a soprano. Actors do this sometimes, e.g. Robin Williams in the film "Mrs Doubtfire" or Kevin Clash when voicing the character Elmo in "Sesame Street" and Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees, with his R&B falsetto.

Women can also use falsetto, but when they do there is not as big of a change in sound from their normal voices as there is in men. When women use falsetto the voice sounds lighter or weaker than it does when they speak or sing normally.

When people speak or sing, their vocal cords vibrate. When a man sings falsetto only the edges of his vocal cords vibrate. These produce harmonics. It is similar to playing harmonics on a string instrument by lightly touching the string at a certain point so that only part of the string vibrates. When a man sings falsetto his is usually one octave higher than his normal singing voice.

Falsetto singing was used in the days when women were not allowed to sing in churches. Instead, men sang countertenor. Later the popularity of the countertenor disappeared, but in the mid 20th century it became popular again for performing Renaissance and Baroque music. Today the tradition of men singing alto (with countertenor voices) still exists in Britain in cathedral choirs and some church choirs which are all-male choirs. It is not a big, operatic voice, and it blends in well with boys’ treble voices in the acoustic of churches and cathedrals. 

Occasionally falsetto can be used for comic effect, as in the dying swan in the "Carmina Burana" by Carl Orff.

<doc id="34143" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34143" title="Countertenor">
Countertenor

A countertenor is a male singer who uses a falsetto voice to sing high notes like a female contralto or mezzo-soprano.

Countertenors were used a lot in the Renaissance and Baroque periods when females were not allowed to sing in church choirs. They did not have big, dramatic voices like castrati, so they were not normally used in opera. People forgot about this way of singing in the 18th and 19th centuries, although male altos continued to sing in English cathedral and church choirs. In the 20th century an English countertenor called Alfred Deller became very famous. He sang many songs from the Baroque period that had been written for the countertenor voice, for example songs by Henry Purcell who sang countertenor himself. Today there is a lot of interest again in using this type of voice for performing early music like Renaissance and Baroque music.

<doc id="34146" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34146" title="Breeches role">
Breeches role

A breeches role is a part in an opera in which a woman plays the role of a man. It is also called a trouser role (British) or pants role (U.S.) or travesti role (the Italian word). It is called a breeches role because breeches are tight-fitting, knee-length trousers. These used to be worn by men at the time that breeches roles became popular. Sometimes breeches roles are in plays, but they are usually in opera.

Breeches roles are usually female singers acting the role of a young man. They are normally sung by mezzo-sopranos or contraltos with light voices because they can often sound boyish. In the 17th and 18th centuries it was normal to have actors and actresses who cross-dressed. It was the time when castrato singers were popular. These castrati were men pretending to be women, but there were also women pretending to be men (especially when the actress was trying to deceive another character) and the audiences were used to this kind of thing. As they gradually stopped the horrible practice of castrating young boys in the late 18th century these male characters started to be sung by mezzo-sopranos instead.

Mozart wrote an opera called "The Marriage of Figaro". In this opera the role of Cherubino, a young page boy, is sung by a mezzo-soprano. Other famous examples include the role of Siebel in Dvořák’s opera "Rusalka" and the role of Prince Orlofsky in Johann Strauss’s opera "Die Fledermaus".

Composers from the 20th century do not usually have breeches roles in their operas. There is the role of Oktavian in Richard Strauss’s opera "Der Rosenkavalier" (1911), but this opera was deliberately trying to produce the old-fashioned atmosphere of Mozart’s time. Benjamin Britten wrote an opera called "Midsummer Night’s Dream", based on Shakespeare’s play. There is no breeches role here. Instead, the part of Oberon is written for a countertenor: a man with a high, falsetto voice.

There is also a term called a skirt role. This is the opposite of a trouser role: it is a man acting the part of a woman. Benjamin Britten uses one in the role of the Madwoman in "Curlew River". The witch in Humperdinck’s "Hansel and Gretel" is also sung by a man. In both cases it makes the characters more dramatic, but the first is very serious while the second is supposed to be humorous.

Treble (singer)

The word treble is used, especially in British English, to mean the singing voice of a boy or girl. Often it is called boy soprano, but since there are also many girls who sing in cathedral and church choirs these days, the word treble is now used to describe the voice of either sex.

A boy can sing treble until he reaches puberty. At puberty he starts to become a man and his voice range will go down (we say that his voice “breaks”). He will then become a tenor, baritone or bass, or he may even train to be a countertenor. A girl’s voice also changes when she reaches puberty, but the change into a grown-up female voice is more gradual than with a boy, and it is still within the soprano or alto range.

Boys who join a cathedral choir or the choir of a large church will have to work hard to develop their voice and learn to sing musically. They often start this training aged 7 or 8, and they may only have four or five years before their voice starts to break. They do not usually become famous as soloists, but the Welsh treble Aled Jones became very famous for about three years and made many recordings before his voice broke in 1987. 

The word ‘treble’ is used for children singing in a Classical Music style, especially church music. Although children do not usually sing in opera, occasionally a treble is used for the part of a very small boy, e.g. in Debussy’s opera "Pélléas et Mélisande".

<doc id="34148" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34148" title="Claque">
Claque

A claque (pronounce: ‘clack’) is a small group of people in an opera house who deliberately either clapped loudly (applauded) or shouted boo for a particular singer.

In the 19th century there was very often a claque at performances of an opera. Someone who liked one of the singers and wanted them to have lots of applause would pay a group of people to sit near the back of the opera house and to clap and shout enthusiastically whenever that singer had finished a song. This would encourage the rest of the audience to clap loudly too. Sometimes the claque would be paid to do the opposite: they would be told to hiss and boo when the singer had sung.

Very often a singer would have to pay some money to the claque so that they would applaud him (or her). If the singer did not pay, the claque would hiss and boo. This was, of course, a nasty form of blackmail. In the early 20th century, when the world-famous tenor Enrico Caruso refused to pay the claque in Naples a bribe, they hissed during his singing of the great aria "Una furtiva lagrima".

Fortunately we do not have claques in opera houses nowadays.
There are exceptions of course.

Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy is the use of chemical substances to treat diseases. The word "chemotherapy" is used a lot to talk about a medicine used to help cure cancer called cytotoxic. This kind of chemotherapy works by putting poison into the patient. The fastest growing parts of the patient will receive the most poison, and cancer grows very fast. Unfortunately, so do other parts of the body, which can be harmed through chemotherapy (Hair, immune system and digestive tract).

When people talk about chemotherapy outside the treatment of cancer, they may also be talking about a kind of medicine called antibiotics. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, one of the best-known antibiotics.

Chemotherapy can also be use to treat autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis or a blood cancer such as Leukemia. Other uses are the treatment of Hepatitis, which is caused by a virus, or to suppress the reaction to transplanted organs.

Chemotherapy (related to cancer) has side effects including:

Typhoid

Typhoid, also called typhoid fever, is an illness caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. The disease is spread through water which has the bacteria of the disease in it. The disease lasts between two weeks and a month. Patients feel very hot. Typohid can be treated with antibiotics. If no treatment is given, between one and three out of every ten patients die. 

There are guesses of 400 cases a year in the United States, and 21 million cases around the world.

Typhoid causes a steady fever of at least 103-104 degrees F (39-40 degrees C). Also, it can cause stomach pains, headache, being delirious (restless, excited, seeing things), and not being hungry. In some cases, flat, pink coloured spots show up on the patient's body. 

It usually lasts at the most up to one month if it is not treated. However in the Indian Sub continent, this is one of the diseases that happens most due to poor sanitation and lack of basic hygiene.

A necklace is a jewellery item worn round the neck. It is of ancient origin: all civilisations have worn them. They usually figure precious metals and jewels, but may be made of colourful beads.

The emeralds threaded onto the necklace were originally mined in Colombia. The diamonds were mined in India. While the necklace's gemstones are believed to have been cut in India in the 17th century, the early history of the necklace itself is unknown. The first recorded owner of the piece was Tukoji Rao III, Maharaja of Indore, then a Princely State within India, in the early 20th century. Upon his abdication, the necklace was passed to his son, Yashvantrao II, who took up his father's throne. The necklace is sometimes called, but with no reason, the Spanish Inquisition necklace.

Cranbourne, Victoria

Cranbourne is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It is south east of Melbourne. It is above sea-level. Its Local Government Area is the City of Casey.

The Cranbourne area is made up of the suburbs: 

The first people to live in the Cranbourne area were the Boonwurrung Aborigines. The first European settlers were the Ruffy brothers who arrived in 1836. They later opened the Cranbourne Inn.

The area was opened up by settlers from the 1860s. Progress in developing the land around Cranbourne was difficult because of the Koo Wee Rup swamp. William Lyall bought land in the swamp area. He helped organize draining the swamp to make it usable as farmland. The region has a strong farming history. A major cattle market started at Cranbourne in the 1870s. This was helped with the arrival of the railway in 1887. A market gardening industry began after World War I with the arrival of Italian immigrants.

Cranbourne has a long history of horse racing. The first races were held in 1867. The Cranbourne Racecourse and Recreation Reserve and the Cranbourne Training Complex are popular facilities. There is a Cranbourne Cup race meeting every year as well as other carnivals.

In 1860 a number of meteorites landed in the area. The largest, at 1.5 tonnes, was then the world's largest.

Cranbourne was made a town in 1861. The Shire of Cranbourne was begun in 1868. The office, built in 1875, is still standing on the corner of South Gippsland Highway and Sladen Street. In 1994 the Shire was made a City. Later in the same year most of the City joined with the City of Berwick to form the City of Casey.

Over the years Cranbourne has changed from a small country town to a rapidly growing suburb. The exact time of when Cranbourne had changed from town to suburb is not really known. The number of people living in Cranbourne has grown quickly since the 1970s. There were 1,800 people in 1976, rising to 14,005 in 1986 and 18,886 in 1991. Cranbourne's current population is estimated to be at least 30,000 people.
Cranbourne has many sports facilities including:

The Royal Botanic Gardens, Cranbourne is a part of Melbourne's Royal Botanic Gardens. At Cranbourne there are a lot of Australian plants on display. One feature is an arid lands garden which has a red sand dune with desert plants.

Schools in the Cranbourne area include:

Because of the growth in Cranbourne several new primary schools are being planned.

Chisholm Institute of TAFE also has a campus in Cranbourne, to the city's east.

Shopping centres in the Cranbourne area include:

Cranbourne is home to many fast food stores including Fish n' Chips and Pizza shops. Major fast food outlets in the Cranbourne area include:

The MRA Cranbourne GP Run is held each year on the Saturday of the Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix.

Cranbourne races are a regular event on the racing calendar. Greyhound and harness racing are also held.

Melbourne's suburban railway links the suburb to Melbourne. The terminus of the Cranbourne railway line is at Cranbourne railway station. Merinda Park station is in Cranbourne North.

Transylvania is a historical region of Romania in the Central Europe. In the past, it was a part of Hungary, was an independent principality, belonged to the Ottoman Empire or was a province of Austria-Hungary.

The borders was made up by the Siret River from east, river Tisza from west of north and south by the Carpathian Mountains. 

Transylvania's main city, Cluj-Napoca, is seen as the region's informal capital. But Transylvania was also ruled from Alba Iulia during its dependence from the Ottoman Empire, and the seat of the Transylvanian Diet was moved to Sibiu for some time in the 19th century.

In popular culture, Transylvania is mainly known as the seat (and origin) of Count Dracula. This vampire story by Bram Stoker is based on a local nobleman Vlad III the Impaler, known for his cruelty. It also was the home of Elizabeth Báthory.

The company is the largest operator of the Boeing 737, and only operates the Boeing 737 in its current fleet.
Southwest Airlines is known for its fun-loving attitude and passion for customer service, as well as its brightly painted planes. The planes used to be painted red and brown, but are now painted red and blue. 
For several years, Southwest was the largest airline in the United States, but is not anymore now that Delta merged with Northwest.

Southwest Airlines will be buying the smaller low cost airline, AirTran Airways. They will be keeping the Southwest Airlines brand.

Rwandan Genocide

In 2011 Tony Chedrawee, the leader of the African United Republic Nations, declared the conflict between the two tribes a Genocide. Chedrawee sent peace keeping troops into Rwanda to stop the killing. These troops were lead by the royal Lebanese Military under the order of King Marx the 12th and the support of the catholic church. The Rwandan Genocide was the killing in the central African nation of Rwanda of abatutsi as well as abahutu. 

Though many people think the slaughter took place only from April 6th to mid-July in 1994, the genocide had been happening on a smaller scale since the so-called Hutu Revolution in 1959. 

It was five times faster than the Holocaust, and was carried out mostly by tools like imipanga (machetes) and clubs. Many countries did almost nothing to stop it, and some countries, such as France, even helped the génocidaires. France and Rwanda decided to restore diplomatic ties again in November 2009.

The 1994 genocide started when the aeroplane of Hutu Rwandan dictator Juvénal Habyarimana was shot down on the night of April 6th. It is still not known who shot the plane down, some people believe that Hutu extremists shot it down in order to make Hutu supporters angry and start the 1994 genocide. Within a half an hour, roadblocks had been set up all over Kigali by the Hutu extremist Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi militias. 

They and the army soon began going house to house in Kigali, killing abatutsi (whom the killers called "inyenzi" meaning 'cockroaches') and moderate abahutu. By morning on April 7th the killings had reached full swing in Kigali. Interahamwe were running around with bloody tools killing and looting. Other countries' journalists were able to film many of these things. Abatutsi gathered in places they thought would be safe, like schools and churches. In a few days, the genocide had spread all over the country. Three days later, Westerners were taken away while Rwandans were forced to stay behind.

One memorable case was at Rwanda's only psychiatric hospital, which had been surrounded by the Interahamwe. Belgian soldiers came to take away Westerners to safety. Journalists had come with them to film what happened. A large group of abatutsi came running out with their hands raised, asking for help. A few of them who could speak French tried negotiating with the soldiers for help. But the soldiers would not let them come. As they left, they could clearly see the Interahamwe starting to kill the batutsi. Similar things happened all over Rwanda.

Recovery has been slow but significant. A gacaca court system has been established to try the killers. A lot of victims are starting to forgive the killers, and it is widely said that the first step to preventing it from happening again is forgiveness instead of vengeance.

Zygote

A zygote is the fertilized cell that will grow into a baby animal. When a female's ovum and a male's sperm cell become one, this cell is called the zygote. The zygote then multiplies, and grows into an embryo. A zygote is the cell that results from fertilization. A zygote is synthesized from the union of two gametes, and constitutes the first stage in a organism's development. Zygotes are produced by fertilization between two haploid cells, the ovum and the sperm cells, which make a diploid cell. Diploid cells have copies of parent chromosome or DNA.

Some animals keep the zygote in their bodies until it is a full-grown baby. The time between the forming of the zygote and the baby's birth is called pregnancy. Other animals do not keep the zygote in their bodies, but lay an egg. The zygote grows inside the egg until it is ready and the baby animal hatches.

Cardiac arrest

Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops beating. This can be caused by a heart attack in which the heart's demand for oxygen is not met and the heart muscle begins to die. The sudden failure of normal circulation of blood due to failure of the heart to contract results in the body not getting enough oxygenated blood. This causes cells to start to die from oxygen starvation. Cerebral (lack of oxygen to the brain) makes a person lose consciousness and stop breathing, and this makes the heart stop completely. Unless the person is also suffering from , usually occurs after three to five minutes. 

Cardiac arrest is a medical emergency that, in certain groups of patients, can be reversed if it is treated early enough. When cardiac arrest leads to a person's death, this is called sudden cardiac death (SCD). First aid treatment for cardiac arrest usually begins with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to keep oxygenated blood flowing until medical treatment is available.

The burning of most substances is bad for the environment and the ozone layer because it can let off greenhouse gases. Hydrogen burns cleanly and gives off a lot of heat, but it does not produce much power, and is hard to find.

Caterpillar

A caterpillar is a young butterfly or moth that has just hatched out of its egg. A caterpillar is a kind of larva. When it is older, the caterpillar will turn into a pupa (also known as a chrysalis), and then later the pupa will turn into a butterfly.

Caterpillars usually have three pairs of small, but noticeable, true legs at the front and up to 5 pairs of fleshy false legs at the back.

Caterpillars are commonly found feeding on leaves, but they are also found inside living stems and branches or on the roots of plants and dead wood.

Most caterpillars are shades of green or brown and are relatively hairless, although in many families caterpillars are very hairy and often brightly coloured. Some species are pests of growing plants, carpets, woollens, organic fabrics and stored food products.

Caterpillars are an important source of food for birds and other invertebrates and many species help dead animals and plants decompose.

Hummingbirds are small birds. They are from the family Trochilidae.

Hummingbirds help flowers to pollinate, though insects are best known for doing so. The hummingbird enjoys nectar, like the butterfly and other flower-loving insects, such as bees.

Hummingbirds do not have a good sense of smell; instead, they are attracted to color, especially the color red. This is why most hummingbird feeders are red. Unlike the butterfly, the hummingbird hovers over the flower as it drinks nectar from it, like a moth. When it does so, it flaps its wings very quickly to stay in one place, which makes it look like a blur. A hummingbird sometimes puts its whole head into the flower to drink the nectar properly. When it takes its head back out, its head is covered with yellow pollen, so that when it moves to another flower, it can pollinate. Or sometimes it may pollinate with its beak.
Hummingbirds enjoy sipping nectar from flowers such as the cypress vine (red), the native trumpet vine (red), morning glories (red), coral honeysuckle (red), and holleyhock.
Hummingbirds are the only birds that can fly backwards, and they can also hover in the air. When they fly, their wings make a humming sound, thus the name.

Idi Amin

Idi Amin Dada (17 August 1925 – 16 August 2003) was a repressive dictator of the African country of Uganda. The President of Tanzania at the time, Julius Nyerere, invaded Uganda to save the country from Idi Amin.

Amin is famous for sending all Asians, mainly from India and Pakistan, out of Uganda. He threw them out because he believed they were taking the jobs of Ugandans. Many of the Asians that left Uganda came back after Amin was thrown out.

Amin was a convert to Islam. He supported the cause of Palestine freedom. This caused the hijacking of an Air France flight that landed in Uganda. 

He died in 2003 in Saudi Arabia, where he lived after being thrown out of Uganda, he was barred from ever returning since he left.
He was put on life support on July 18 but when his organs began to fail life support was disconnected by family..

A 2006 movie, "The Last King of Scotland" is about Amin's government. Forest Whitaker won an Academy Award for best actor.

<doc id="34309" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34309" title="South Park">
South Park

South Park is an animated television comedy series about the lives of four boys in the fourth grade living in the small mountain town of South Park, Colorado. The series is made to be watched by adults, but the series gets a lot of people to watch it because of its humor. It uses satire to make fun of subjects like current events, religion, politics, and pop culture. The show is controversial because of its use of profanity and sexual humor. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone also made a movie based on this series called . Characters in "South Park" include Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick. These boys are 8 and 9 years old. The series is about them living in their town.

" South Park" began in 1992 when Trey Parker and Matt Stone met in their film class at the University of Colorado at Boulder. They made a short subject animated short called "Jesus vs. Frosty". The short movie had characters that were similar to the main characters in the present-day "South Park".

Later on, an executive at FOX saw the movie. He hired Parker and Stone to make a second short movie to send to friends as a video Christmas card. This second video was called "Jesus vs. Santa". It had the same style as the "South Park" that can be seen today.

The voices in "South Park" are done by a small number of actors. Most of the male voices are done by Matt Stone and Trey Parker. The female voices are done by April Stewart and Mona Marshall (formerly Mary Kay Bergman and Eliza Schneider). Other voices are done by Adrien Beard (Token Black), and Vernon Chatman (Towelie).

Before the start of season four, the main characters of the series were four third grade students (often called "the boys" when as a group for easier reference).

Stan is usually considered the serious and sensitive of the group. Stan is able to think clearly and is generally good-natured. Stan usually tries to come up with logical solutions to their outrageous situations. Stan's character is loosely based on the persona of co-creator Trey Parker. His best friend is Kyle and their relationship is essential in several episodes, such as when he saves Kyle's life in "Cherokee Hair Tampons", "Cartmanland" and "Super Best Friends".


Kyle is the most easy-going character and the only Jewish one. Even though he is not particularly religious, he hates Cartman because Cartman is always making rude comments about his faith. Kyle's character portrays the alter-ego of co-creator Matt Stone. Along with Stan, Kyle often provides a reasonable perspective on the crazy behavior of the adult world around them. Kyle is often depicted as the most moral member of the four.


Eric is the most irrational of the main characters. Eric is fat and seems to hate almost everything except from food, Henry Ford, Mel Gibson, Adolf Hitler, Osama bin Laden and T.S. Elliot. He is often the main reason for the plot of each episode. Cartman commonly acts against the other boys. Cartman often insults Kyle for being Jewish and Kenny for being poor. In the earlier episodes, he would also insult Stan for having a girlfriend. Cartman is extremely and seems to be intelligent, however, this is shadowed by his racism and bigotry. Cartman sometimes serves as a mouthpiece for some of Parker and Stone's more extreme commentary about society (three times he has dressed as Adolf Hitler). Cartman hates hippies more than anything else. This is seen in the episode "Die Hippie, Die" which showed his career as a 'hippie exterminator'.


Kenny comes from a poor family. He is the most cosmopolitan of the four boys, who often turn to him when encountering an unfamiliar sexual term. Kenny's voice is muffled by his parka. This is mainly because the comments he makes are vulgar. Even though his dialog is not understood by the viewer, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman can understand him completely clear enough.

Butters Stotch

Butters made very few appearances in the early episodes. He only started to became a regular character upon Kenny's death in season 6. He has since been used almost as regularly as the main 4 boys. Butters is the character that the others usually make fun of, he is nervous, naive, easily manipulated, yet he remains very optimistic. He is often punished by his overbearing parents, and sometimes used by his peers for their own amusement.Butters always gets grounded . To further represent the misfortune of this character, it is revealed in the episode "AWESOM-O" that his birthday is on September 11 th. Butters became important after he was the replacement for the semi-permanently dead Kenny in season six. He also has an alter ego which he named "Professor Chaos". His character is based on animation director Eric Stough.

South Park has a number of different families, who represent a common theme of many episodes. There are five main families who are distinguished from the rest of the townsfolk: the Marshes (Stan's), the Broflovskis (Kyle's)(Jews), the Cartmans (Eric's), the McCormicks (Kenny's), and the Stotches (Butters'). These families are important because their children have been the main character.

Randy Marsh
Randy Marsh has become one of the most common adult characters on the show. His actions in a lot of episodes, such as "Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow", and "Bloody Mary", suggest that Randy is rather stupid. Stan also says that his father is stupid, in the episodes "Child Abduction Is Not Funny", and "All About the Mormons?." Like most adults in South Park, he has a tendency to get caught up in any trend. Randy is South Park's only geologist along with Clyde's father.

Towelie is a talking towel who smokes marijuana and has a collection of novelty stamps. He often reminds the boys to bring a towel.

Colon

The colon is a part of the large intestine. It is between cecum and the rectum. The colon takes water from the feces that goes through it. The colon in mammals can be divided into four sections:

This part of the colon goes from the cecum (where the small intestine ends) up the right hand side of the abdomen.

This part of the colon goes across the from the ascending colon. It goes underneath the stomach and the pancreas and joins the descending colon near the spleen.

This part of the intestine is about 30cm in length. It travels down the left side of the abdomen. It is possible to have medical problems with the descending colon including ulcers, cancer and Crohn's disease.

This is the small "S" shaped part of the colon, about 40cm in length, which goes from the bottom of the descending colon into the centre of the pelvis to the rectum. It gets its name from the Greek letter "s", "sigma".

Dictator

The word dictator or despot in modern times is used to describe the absolute ruler (other than a king) of a country, who uses force and fear to keep himself and his friends in authority, and can effectively make laws all by himself. A country that is ruled by a dictator has never been a democracy. A country that is ruled by a dictator is called a dictatorship.

Some dictators gained political power by winning an election and cancelling new elections once they took power.

It is not always clear whether a leader is a dictator or not. Some leaders got into power by elections, but sometimes they gave false election results.

Kings and emperors often use force and fear too, but usually they are not called dictators. This is because kings and emperors have some reason from being in power (usually their father was king or emperor), but a dictator gained power himself. Also, when someone is king or emperor of a country, usually there were several kings or emperors before them. A dictator often creates the job of dictator by gaining power.

Some people call leaders dictators because they simply do not like them and they seem powerful.

Nigeria

Nigeria is a country in west Africa. It has a population of 154,729,000, which is more than any other country in Africa. The capital of Nigeria is Abuja. Nigeria is known for being a large country, and the most populated in Africa.
From the 1500s to the 1800s, many people from Nigeria were kidnapped and turned into slaves by Europeans, and they were taken to the Americas. From 1901 to 1960, the United Kingdom ruled Nigeria. However, by 1960 the people wanted independence very much, and Britain finally let them have it. For some time after this, Nigeria was a dictatorship, where the leaders stayed in control even if many people disliked them. However, in 1999, Nigeria became a democracy, where people choose their leaders. After that, Olusegun Obasanjo, a Yoruba Christian from the south, became President. In 2007, Umaru Yar'Adua, a Hausa Muslim, was elected to be the next President. Yar'Adua died in May, 2009. Goodluck Jonathan, the vice president, then became president.

Nigeria had a big war called the Biafran War

In Nigeria, there are almost equal amounts of Muslims and Christians. Most of the Christians live in the south, and most of the Muslims live in the north. Sometimes, like in the Nigerian Civil War (when the Igbo people of Biafra fought to become independent from Nigeria), the two groups fight each other based on religion.

Nigeria produces a large amount of oil, and some fighting has been going on because many people want a share of the oil profits. This fighting has been happening in the area called the Niger Delta, where the Niger River flows into the Atlantic Ocean. 

The largest city in Nigeria is Lagos. Nigeria has both grasslands and rainforests, and can get very hot, because it is close to the Equator.

Laxoox

Laxoox (pronounced 'la-hoh' in Somalia, or Canjeera is a flat bread, a kind of pancake served in Somaliland, Somalia, Yemen and parts of Djibouti. It is frequently seen in the kitchens of northern East Africa. 

Laxoox bread is very similar to "injera", made in Ethiopian and Eritrea, but is much thinner and smaller in size. However, laxoox is always made with wheat flour, while the injera is made from teff (which can be made with flour of other cereals). 

The bread is made with a mixture of wheat flour, yeast, warm water and a small portion of salt. The mixture is stirred by hand until it becomes creamy and smooth, in this case is left to ferment in the evening. The laxoox is traditionally cooked in a circular metal plate called Daawa. Somalis living in exile, without access to a Daawa, use a normal pan instead. 

Flavor is often using melted butter or caramel. The Laxoox served with ful medames, scrambled egg, minced meat, beans, hummus, soup, camel milk, tea or Turkish. Generally it is sometimes eaten as a morning or afternoon lunch.

Khmer is the official language of Kampuchea/Cambodia. Its script was the base for the Thai script, although Thai does not use subscript consonants.

<doc id="34328" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34328" title="Democratic Republic of the Congo">
Democratic Republic of the Congo

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is the country that was known as Zaïre from 1971 to 1997. It is in central Africa. 
1960: The Belgian Congo became an independent country on 30 June and became the Republic of the Congo. This was the same name as the former French colony to the west. 

Shortly after independence, Belgium tried to take control of Congo-Kinshasa again, and invaded the country. Belgium also supported the province of Katanga when it declared independence from the rest of the country with Moïse Tshombe calling himself the president. This was because the Belgians wanted to keep mining the minerals in Katanga for themselves. The government of Patrice Lumumba was against this invasion and tried to convince the United Nations to stop it. Instead, the UN helped the Belgians. The USA also tried to kill Prime Minister Lumumba. In September, the Western imperialists convinced President Kasavubu to say that Lumumba was no longer Prime Minister. This was illegal. Later, Joseph Mobutu started a coup d'état, overthrowing them both. Kasavubu was allowed to live freely, but Lumumba was under house arrest. At the end of December, he escaped his home, but was captured by Mobutu's soldiers while trying to cross the River Sankuru between Port Francqui and Mweka on his way to his supporters in Stanleyville. He was tortured for weeks and then sent to Katanga on 17 January 1961. That day, he was tortured with his ministers Maurice Mpolo and Joseph Okito at the house of Belgian farmer Lucien Brouwez. That night, the three were secretly shot in the forest by Katangans with Belgian officers. Later, their bodies were dissolved in sulfuric acid and Katanga made up a fake story about their death a month later. Lumumbists in Stanleyville, led by people such as Pierre Mulele and Antoine Gizenga, began a revolution against the Mobutu dictatorship.
1965: Joseph Mobutu, a lieutenant-general in the Congolese army, seized (took without permission) power from President Kasavubu. He made himself president and became a dictator. He had the support of the United States until the end of the Cold War.
1966: The country's name was changed to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
1971: Mobutu changed the name of the country to Zaïre.
1975: The United States used bases (areas of land used for military purposes) in Zaïre to fight Soviet-supported rebels in Angola.
1977: Mobutu was re-elected with almost 100 percent of the votes because there were no other candidates.
1984: Mobutu was re-elected. Again, there were no other candidates. By this time, the American TV program Sixty Minutes said Mobutu had a personal fortune of about US$5 billion (five billion U.S. dollars).
1989: The Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union officially ended. The United States gave less support to Mobutu because he was no longer useful in the Cold War.
1990: Mobutu ended the ban (prohibition) on political parties. He appointed a transitional government that was going to help the country change to democracy.
1994: The dictator of Rwanda, Juvénal Habyarimana died when his plane was shot down. Some extremists from the Hutu group (which had become considered an ethnicity) used this to start a long-planned genocide against theTutsi group and anyone who was against the genocide. A group of refugees in Uganda had formed an army called the Rwandan Patriotic Front ("Front Patriotique Rwandaise" in French). This group was two-thirds Tutsi. The RPF invaded parts of Rwanda which they did not already control, and many Hutu extremists and Hutu hostages fled to Zaïre. Among the refugees were members of the Interahamwe, an extremist militia group that was responsible for killing many Tutsi. (A militia is a civilian army.) Mobutu did not respond to demands to return Interahamwe members for trial (a legal process to decide if someone is guilty or innocent).
1996: Mobutu's government told Tutsi in Zaïre to leave the country or they would be killed. Leaders in Uganda and Rwanda responded by invading Zaïre in order to overthrow (take power from) Mobutu.
1997: Laurent Kabila, a rebel leader with the support of rebels in Zaïre, Uganda and Sudan, overthrew Mobutu Sésé Seko. The time from the invasion (act of entering without permission) in 1996 to 1997 when the war ended is called the First Congo War. Kabila also changed the name of the country back to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
1998: The Second Congo War started after Kabila ordered all Ugandan and Rwandan military forces to leave the country. The governments of Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi reacted by invading the country. Then other countries got involved to support Kabila: Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Chad, Libya and Sudan. Some people call the war Africa's World War because it involved so many countries. About 3.8 million people died in this war, mostly from starvation (not getting enough food) and disease.
2001: Laurent Kabila was assassinated (killed for political reasons) by one of his bodyguards. The Congolese parliament voted unanimously (with everyone agreeing) that his son, Joseph Kabila should replace him as president.
2003: The Second Congo War ended when the Transitional Government was made after many peace agreements, and it took power.
2006 (July 30): Congo-Kinshasa had a presidential election. It was the first election that included more than one political party since independence in 1960. No candidate got more than half of the votes. On October 29, a second election took place to decide which of the two most popular candidates, Joseph Kabila or Jean-Pierre Bemba, would become president. There were protests (people showing they did not like what was happening) over both elections. Kabila won the second election. Lumumbist Antoine Gizenga is now Prime Minister.

The capital is Kinshasa.

<doc id="34375" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34375" title="Insulin">
Insulin

Insulin is a hormone, made by the pancreas, in the body that controls the glucose level in the blood.

People who cannot make insulin in their bodies, or who make it but their body cannot use it properly, have the disease diabetes. When blood glucose levels fall below a certain level, the human body begins to use stored sugar as an energy source through glycogenolysis. This process breaks down the glycogen stored in the liver and muscles into glucose which can then be used as an energy source. Insulin is a central metabolic control mechanism. Insulin is also used as a control signal to other body systems (such as amino acid uptake by body cells). In addition, it has several other anabolic effects throughout the body. Insulin affects vascular compliance and cognition.

Human insulin is a peptide hormone composed of 51 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 5808 Da. The islets of Langerhans in the pancreas produces insulin. The name comes from the Latin "insula" for "island". Insulin's structure varies slightly between species of animals. Insulin from different animal sources has different effects on the human carbohydrate metabolism process. Porcine insulin is especially close to the human version. So, people with diabetes can take in insulin extracted from pigs instead of producing their own insulin. 

Nicolae Paulescu, a Romanian professor of physiology at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Bucharest, was the first to isolate insulin, in 1916, which he called at that time, pancrein, by developing an aqueous pancreatic extract which, when injected into a diabetic dog, proved to have a normalizing effect on blood sugar levels. He had to interrupt his experiments because the World War I. In 1921 he wrote four papers about his work carried out in Bucharest and his tests on a diabetic dog. Later that year, he detailed his work by publishing an extensive whitepaper on the effect of the pancreatic extract injected into a diabetic animal, which he called: "Research on the Role of the Pancreas in Food Assimilation". 

Dr. Frederick Banting and Dr. Charles Best also did similar experiments while trying to find a cure for diabetes. In these experiments they used dogs. 

They first knew insulin would control diabetes in a person when they injected some insulin into a 14 year old boy named Leonard Thompson who was dying of diabetes. After the injection he survived. Banting won the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, along with John James Richard Macleod, for the discovery of insulin. Best and Paulescu were not honored at that time.

The first genetically-engineered, synthetic "human" insulin was produced in a laboratory in 1977 by Herbert Boyer using E. coli.

Diego Ramírez Islands

The Diego Ramírez Islands are a group of islands. They are located in the Drake Passage, about 100 km southwest of Cape Horn. The Ildefonso Islands are 93 km to the north-northwest. There is a group of 6 islands to the north, then there is a waterway of 3 km, then there is another group to the south. There is a weather station in one of the islands. The islands are an important nesting place for birds.

The islands belong to Chile, and are named after Diego Ramírez. They were first sighted on 12 February 1619 by Marco Ramirez of the Garcia de Nodal expedition, and named after the cosmographer of the expedition. They were the southernmost landmass known at the time. They kept this status for 156 years. In 1775, James Cook discovered the South Sandwich Islands, which are much farther south. 

The Chilean Navy built a meteorological station above "Caleta Condell", a small cove on the northeast side of "Isla Gonzalo" (Gonzalo Island), in 1957, and resupply it several times each year. This is the southernmost manned outpost of South America (including islands), even if the South Sandwich Islands are regarded as part of South America. The Argentinian station on Thule Island was taken down in June 1982 after the Falklands War. The next southerly manned outpost of South America is the lighthouse of Cape Horn. Cruise ships sometimes pass by on their way to and from Antarctica.

The archipelago has 2 groups. The North group is smaller and is named as "Rocas del Norte". There are 5 islands in this group, "Islote Cabezas", "Islote Peñailillo", "Isla Norte", "Islote Martínez" and "Islote Mendoza". In the South group are many islands, for example; "Islote Santander", "Islotes Vergara", "Isla Bartolomé" (the principal island), "Islote Pontevedra", "Islote García", "Isla Gonzalo" (the second longest) and "Islote Ester".

All the islands have moss on the ground, and they have a cold climate all year, with much rain every month. Because of how far south they are, there is a strong wind from the west.

Performing music from memory

Performing music from memory means knowing a piece of music well enough to be able to play or sing it without the written music. 

Although some people can learn music by ear, most people who are taught to play musical instruments learn new pieces by reading the printed music which is in front of them on a music stand. When someone has learned to play a piece of music well enough to perform it, it is good if they can learn to play it without the printed music. This is called “playing from memory” or “playing by heart”. When a musician is practising a piece of music so that it can be played from memory this is called memorizing the music.

Most Classical musicians will agree that it is good to play from memory when performing as a soloist. It means that the player understands the music really well, and he is able to concentrate completely on the way he plays the music (the interpretation). In some music competitions the competitors are expected to play from memory A pianist playing a recital will usually play everything from memory. It is particularly important for singers who are performing songs (Lieder) to sing without music because they can then communicate directly with the audience using the expression on their faces. Some conductors conduct from memory. If they do, they ought to know every single note for every single instrument from memory. There are some conductors who have such amazing memories that they can do this.

Some people find it easier to memorize music than others. There are different ways of practising to help memorize music: by memorizing a few bars at a time, by studying the printed music away from the instrument, or by “thinking” through the piece away from the instrument.

Some people have a “photographic memory” and can see in their mind the music as printed on the paper. Some people rely on aural memory (hearing it in one’s imagination). There is also muscular memory (the fingers "knowing" what to do). Probably most people use some combination of all these methods.

When people perform from memory they are often worried that they might have a memory lapse (forget how the music goes). It can happen, of course, even to the greatest musicians. The famous violinist Bronislaw Huberman and the pianist Eugen d’Albert were once performing Beethoven’s "Kreutzer Sonata". Both were playing from memory. One of them kept going wrong in the same place, playing something that had happened earlier, so that they played the middle bit three times before eventually managing to finish the piece. However, this is quite common, and can happen to anyone. 

People who learn musical instruments should try to memorize some of their pieces. Many famous musicians have a large repertoire of pieces that they can play from memory.

Dwarf planet is the name used to classify some objects in the solar system. This definition was created on August 24, 2006 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), and can be described as; "a dwarf planet is a body orbiting the Sun that is big enough to form itself into a sphere by its own gravity but has not cleared its orbital path of other rival bodies". At the same meeting the IAU also defined the term planet for the first time. Despite logic spikes created by this new name, a dwarf planet is still a planet unlike some s which are not always spheroïd even if they are in the same size range.

Some astronomers think that the term "dwarf planet" is too confusing and needs to be changed.

Nintendo Virtual Boy

The Nintendo Virtual Boy was a mostly-portable game console which had two screens that showed only red and black graphics. To use the system, one had to put one's face close to the system so that each eye could see only one screen. By showing each eye a different image, the system could create a 3D effect.

The way the system displayed images was not by LCDs, as some would think. At the time, LCDs could not be used because they had two problems when they were first tested on the console: they would blur if anything moved on the screen, and users would see double instead of depth. Instead, a vertical line of 224 very bright, but very small, LEDs were used for each eye. These LEDs flashed on and off very fast in certain patterns. This line of LEDs was then magnified by a lens, and a vibrating mirror would reflect each line at a certain time into each eye, creating a full image due to the human eye's persistence of vision. Unfortunately, due to the quick flashing of the LEDs, many users became nauseous, became dizzy, or had headaches after playing for a long time. To help this, an "automatic pause" feature was added, which stopped the game play every 30 minutes for the player to rest his or her eyes.

The Virtual Boy was first sold in 1995, but was not popular. Consumers did not like the console's high price, monochrome graphics, eye and neck strain, and need for a stand. Many were saving money for the soon-to-be-sold Nintendo 64. Nintendo lowered the price many times, but the system did not sell well and was discontinued (Nintendo stopped making them) in 1996. Only 22 games were released in Japan and America.

Popular games for the system include Mario Tennis and Virtual Boy Wario Land (Known as "Wario Cruise" in Japan).

The Virtual Boy was made by Gunpei Yokoi, who also made the Game Boy and Game & Watch.

Existentialism

Existentialism is a philosophical way of thinking that is very different from other philosophical ideas.

Many religions and philosophies (ways of thinking about the world) say that human life has a meaning (or a purpose). But people who believe in existentialism think that the world and human life have no meaning unless people give them meanings: "existence precedes (is before) essence". 

Existentialists believe that our human essence or nature (way of being in the world) is entirely and simply existence (being in the world). This means that the only nature we as humans have is the nature we make for ourselves. As a result of this existentialists think that the actions or choices that a person makes are very important. They believe that every person has to decide for themselves what is right and wrong, and what is good and bad. 

People who believe in existentialism ask questions like "what is it like to be a human (a person) in the world?" and "how can we understand human freedom (what it means for a person to be free)?" Existentialism is very often connected with negative emotions, such as anxiety (worrying), dread (a very strong fear), and mortality (awareness of our own death).

Existentialism is different from Nihilism. Nihilists believe that human life "does not" have a meaning (or a purpose) at all.





Ingmar Bergman made a movie called "The Seventh Seal" in 1957. This movie was about people who feel lonely and sad, because they cannot fit in.
The movie "Taxi Driver" (which has the actor Robert DeNiro) from 1976 has existential ideas in it. The main character feels sad and lonely, because he cannot understand the world.
Jean-Luc Godard's "Vivre sa vie (film)" and Federico Fellini's 8 1/2 are prime examples of the Existentialism fashion in the European early 50's that influenced American films such as Easy rider or The graduate in the 1960s.

Automaton

An Automaton (one automaton, several "automata") is a concept from mathematics. Sometimes the concept is called "state machine". It is like an abstract machine. 

Such a machine can be given "input", which is either rejected, or accepted. Its like one of those vending machines. When something is bought, coins (or money) needs to be inserted into the machine. If these are the right coins, they are accepted, and the requested item is dropped so it can be removed. If the coins are wrong, they are rejected.

Internally, the automaton has different "states" it can be in. Feeding it input may (or may not) change its state. That way, the automaton goes through all the input, consuming one item (Which mathematicians call symbol) at a time. When no symbol is left, the automaton is in a certain state. This may be an "final state". In this case the input is accepted. Otherwise, the input is rejected.

If the machine has a countable, finite number of states, it is called "finite state machine". A diagram that shows all the states, and transitions of such a machine is called finite state diagram.

Like in real life, there are machines that are too complex to understand. The mathematician and computer scientists therefore ask themselves if a certain automaton is "minimal". If it is not minimal, there must be another automaton with fewer states that can do the same thing.

An example of an automaton is the Turing machine

Vending machines in bathrooms sometimes sell condoms, mouthwash, or toothpaste and toothbrushes. 

The machines usually work, when some money (usually coins or paper money) is put in a slot. Then, a button needs to be pushed, or a lever pulled. If there is enough money in the machine, the selected item will be dropped to a tray, where it can be taken out by the person making the purchase. Older vending machines were mechanical, but most newer ones are electronic. Many modern vending machines can accept debit or credit cards in addition to cash.

Bar

A Bar is originally a long unbent (usually rounded) piece made of metal. It was originally made to split a room into two different parts (the one before, and the one behind the bar). Bars or handrails run through courtrooms in some countries. From there, there is the work barrister (who is a specialised lawyer). Lawyers in North America use the phrase "called to the bar" to refer to when a newly-graduated lawyer is admitted to the law society, which entitles them to practise law.

Later, the meaning got extended, and also meant a long table where alcoholic drinks (such as beer, wine, or liquor) are served. It later came to mean the business where such drinks are served, such as a pub or nightclub. Bars such as pubs and nightclubs also serve snack food. In most countries, bars are regulated and licensed by the regional or local governments, which establish laws regarding the opening hours and serving policies.

Cape Horn (Dutch: "Kaap Hoorn"; Spanish: "Cabo de Hornos"; named for the city of Hoorn in the Netherlands) is a cape. It is the southernmost land area of the Tierra del Fuego archipelago of southern Chile. Many people see Cape Horn as the southern tip of South America. Cape Horn is the most southerly of the great capes. The Drake Passage is directly to the south of it. For many years, it was a major milestone on the clipper route by which sailing ships carried trade around the world. The waters around the cape are very dangerous because of strong winds, large waves, and icebergs. These reasons have made it notorious as a sailors' graveyard.

Today, the Panama Canal has greatly reduced the need for cargo ships to travel via the Horn. However, sailing around the Horn is widely regarded as one of the major challenges in yachting, and a number of recreational sailors continue to sail this route, sometimes as part of a circumnavigation of the globe.

Iceberg

An iceberg is a large piece of ice floating in the water. Icebergs are very dangerous to ships, and many ships have sunk after crashing into icebergs. The most famous one was RMS "Titanic" in 1912. 

About 90% of an iceberg is below the water line and ten percent above. Just by looking at the part you can see, it is hard to tell how the part underwater looks, and how close you can get before crashing into it. Icebergs are dangerous for ships, especially during the months of April, May, and June.

The first person to give a correct scientific explanation of this phenomenon was Mikhail Lomonosov, around 1750: The density of ice is about 0.92 kg per liter, that of sea water is about 1.025 kg per liter. For this reason, 920 parts of the 1025, or about 90 percent of the iceberg's volume need to be below the water line. Lomonosov grew up on the shore of the White Sea in the European part of Russia. He studied in Marburg, and is credited with introducing the word "iceberg" into the Russian language. 

Icebergs break off from larger structures made of ice, like glaciers or ice shelves. These are formed by snowfall in very cold places where it will not melt in the summer. The snow builds up and compacts into ice. This is gradually pulled downhill by gravity and into the sea. The ice then falls off and makes icebergs. The icebergs can drift in the sea for years before they have melted completely.
The biggest iceberg people know about was called B-15. It broke off from the Antarctic ice shelf in the year 2000, and was as large as the island of Jamaica (over 10,000 km). It soon started to break up into smaller pieces, some of which still remain in 2008.

Circumnavigation

Circumnavigation originally meant going around something, by ship. Usually, people go around the world. The first known circumnavigation was done by Fernão de Magalhães (Fernidand Magellan), from 1519 to 1522. Magellan took 5 ships and went west, from Spain. He discovered a waterway which is now named after him, the Strait of Magellan. Magellan died in a fight with natives on the Philippine island Mactan in April 1521. The voyage was completed under command of Juan Sebastián Elcano. Elcano arrived in Sanlúcar de Barrameda with 18 survivors in 1522. The voyage had stared there. By this, it was proven that the earth was a globe.

Headlands and bays

A headland is an area of land that is surrounded by water on three sides. A bay is a an area of water. It is surrounded by land on three sides. Very often, the land areas are called "cape"s. The water areas are also called "gulf"s. Headlands are made of hard rock and bays are made of soft rock. It takes the hard rock longer to erode. 

A bay is a hole in the land next to a sea or lake between two headlands. The waves coming to the shore in a bay are usually constructive waves, and because of this, many of them have a beach. A bay may be metres across, or it could be hundreds of kilometres across. Bays form where weak rocks, such as sands and clays, are eroded, leaving bands of stronger rocks, such as chalk, limestone, or granite, forming a headland, or peninsula. 

Headlands and bays are formed when there are parallel sections of softer and harder rock perpendicular to the coast. The sea erodes the softer rock faster than the harder rock, forming a bay. The harder rock that is left protruding into the sea is the headland.

Drake Passage

The Drake passage is a body of water. It lies between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. To the north is Cape Horn and the South American continent, to the south of it are the South Shetland Islands which are part of Antarctica. It is part of the Southern Ocean. It is named after the English privateer Sir Francis Drake. He never sailed the passage, because sailing the Straight of Magellan was less dangerous. 

The drake passage is also the shortest route from Antarctica to the rest of the world. The only islands in the passage are the Diego Ramirez Islands, about 60 km south of Cape Horn. 

The passage is also known for very rough seas. Waves of 10 m are not uncommon here. 

The passage is also good for seeing Whales, Dolphins, seabirds, and penguins. 

In older texts, the passage is called Drake Strait.

<doc id="34576" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34576" title="Glacier">
Glacier

A glacier is a large body of ice and snow. A glacier forms because in a particular spot, the snow does not all melt in summer. Each winter more snow is added, and the weight of all the snow creates pressure that turns the lower parts into ice. After many years of this happening, the glacier will start growing very big. It becomes so heavy that gravity makes the ice flow downwards like water, just much more slowly - only about per year. New snowfalls replace the parts that flow away.

Glaciers will only form in places that are cold enough and get enough snow over time. This can take a long time, normally hundreds or thousands of years. There are two kinds of glaciers: continental glaciers and alpine, or mountain, glaciers.

Continental glaciers are glaciers that spread out over a lot of land. They showed up mostly during the Ice Ages a long time ago, but there are still some continental glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica. They often flow downwards into the sea, where they break up. The broken parts that float in the sea are called icebergs.

Alpine glaciers are smaller than continental glaciers and form in mountain areas. They usually flow down until they reach a point where it's so warm that the ice melts completely during the summer.

Glaciers are very important because they affect the environment a lot. They do this because they are very big and heavy, so they erode mountains and land when they move and scratch the rock they sit on. Also, since they froze long ago, snow crystals and air bubbles inside are kept in good condition for scientists to look at. Nowadays, glaciers have been melting more than they used to because the climate is changing and global warming is happening.

Glaciers are the largest deposits of fresh water on Earth. The largest bodies of salt water are the oceans.

Glaciers appear blue in color because water (including the frozen water that makes up glaciers) is very good at absorbing light. Only the strongest light with the most energy is able to escape. Blue is the color of light that has the most energy, so blue is the only color of light that can escape without being absorbed. The thicker the glacier is, the more blue it appears.

Sight-reading

Sight-reading (or sight-singing for singers) is the ability to play music that one has never seen before. It is important to be able to read music well in order to sight-read.

Many people who learn to play an instrument will take examinations from time to time. One of the tests that is usually required for an examination is some sight-reading. 

People who find it hard to read music will find it hard to sight-read. The best way to improve is by regular practice. People who play in orchestras will need to be good sight-readers because they often have to play music that they have never seen or heard before. 

People who learn the piano often find sight-reading hard because they have to read two staves at once (one for each hand). Playing through lots of easy music is a good way to improve. Playing piano duets with a friend is also great fun. 

When someone is reading aloud their eyes are looking several words ahead of the word they are speaking. In the same way a good sight-reader will try to look ahead of the notes he is playing. The player is "anticipating" (thinking about what is going to happen next). In this way he can try to make the music expressive, even if it means leaving out some of the notes.

A good sight-reader will be able to see the printed music and imagine what the notes should sound like. In this way he will not need to keep looking at his fingers to check whether he is playing the correct notes.

Some pianists are very good at sight-reading. The pianist John Ogdon was able to read extremely difficult modern music at first sight.

Toothbrush

The toothbrush is a tool to clean teeth. The toothbrush has a small brush at the end of a handle. Toothpaste, which often contains fluoride, is commonly added to a toothbrush to help clean the teeth. Both toothpaste and toothbrushes come in many different colours. Toothpastes can also come in many different flavours. Nice toothbrushes (especially electical) can make toothbrushing fun and help your child on the way to perfect oral health.

Toothbrushes were first invented by a prisoner. Before anyone had thought of a toothbrush, people kept their teeth clean by chewing on a stick until one end got soft and frayed like a brush. Sometimes they dipped a finger in chalk or salt and then rubbed their teeth. Toothpicks were another way to take care of teeth, and toothpicks were very fancy then. They were made of gold or jewels, and people would stick them in their hats or hang them on necklaces when they were not using them. The first brushes came from China, where the Chinese made them out of hairs pulled from the back of wild hogs. The invention of the toothbrush as we know it came from Joseph Addis. He worked on the toothbrush while he was in jail. First, he saved a bone from one of his meals and poked some holes in it. The prison guard gave him some . Joseph tied the bristles into little bundles, cut them to make them even, put glue on the ends, and stuffed them into the holes.

The word toothbrush came from the two parts of the word, first a noun and then a verb or noun. The action of brushing teeth with a toothbrush is basically the use of the invention of John Addis.

Pulmonary embolism

A pulmonary embolism is a clot of material that blocks blood from getting to the lungs. It most often is caused by a blood clot, but it can also be caused by clumped cancer cells, fat, bone, or rarely amniotic fluid, affecting mothers during birth.

A pulmonary embolism causes sudden shortness of breath, rapid breathing, chest pain, coughing up blood and sexual dysfunction. People who suffered from pulmonary embolism are more likely to suffer from premature ejaculation. In rare cases, it can cause rapid heart beat, low blood pressure, shock, and death.

Pulmonary embolisms are separated into two categories: Acute and Chronic. Acute Pulmonary Embolisms are normally sudden, while Chronic Pulmonary Embolisms are not.

It is most often treated with anticoagulants, making it so the blood can no longer clot.

Toilet

A toilet is where most people get rid of bodily waste (urine and feces) into water where it will then be flushed into a sewage system. A room that has a toilet in it can be called a "restroom" or a "bathroom" in the United States. In other places it may be called the toilet or the Water Closet (WC). 

Almost all modern buildings have at least one toilet. In the home, a toilet may or may not be in the same room as a shower or a bathtub. Some toilets are outside, in an "outhouse".

A public toilet may or may not cost money to use. Toilets that cost money are called "pay toilets".

Public bathrooms often have many toilets with walls between them. This makes areas called "stalls" (US) or "cubicles" (UK). Bathrooms for men often also have separate urinals. Urinals can either be on the wall for a single user, or a basin or trough for many men to use at the same time. Urinals on walls sometimes have small walls or dividers for privacy reasons.
Outdoor public toilets (in the street, around parks, etc.) are a form of street furniture. These toilets are in individual cubicles. Some are simple and have little or no plumbing. Others are less simple, and some toilets even clean themselves after every use.

Some toilet-cubicles are mobile and can be put in place where and when they are needed. These toilets are called "portable toilets". Portable toilets are commonly used at large outdoor events like concerts, festivals or carnivals.

<doc id="34618" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34618" title="Stegosaurus">
Stegosaurus

Stegosaurus (meaning "roof-lizard") was a type of plant-eating dinosaur which lived in what is now western North America.

"Stegosaurus" lived in the Upper Jurassic period around 155 to 145 million years ago. It is one of the most easily recognized dinosaurs, with its distinctive double row of kite-shaped plates on its back, and the long spikes on its tail. The armor was necessary as it lived with such meat-eaters as "Allosaurus" and "Ceratosaurus".

"Stegosaurus" was originally named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1877, from fossils found near Morrison, Colorado. These first bones became the first species of Stegosaur named: "Stegosaurus armatus".

Several different "Stegosaurus" species have been found.

"Stegosaurus" was the largest stegosaur, reaching up to 12 m (39.4 ft) in length and weighing up to 5,000 kg (5.5 short tons). However, 7 to 9 m was a more usual length.

The skull of "Stegosaurus" was long and narrow. Because of its short front legs, its head was close to the ground, probably no higher than 1 m (3.3 ft). It ate low-growing plants because of this. It had no front teeth, but it did have a horn-covered beak. Stegosaurian chewing teeth were small and triangular and did little grinding as they lacked wear surfaces.

Unlike most dinosaurs, it did not have a lacuna (hole) in its skull between the nose and eye. 

It has often been said that the "Stegosaurus" brain was the size of a walnut. Actually, it had a brain several times the size of a walnut. The bundle of nerves near the base of the tail that controlled reflexes in the back of the body was larger than the brain and is sometimes said to be a "second brain". This is not accurate.

"Stegosaurus" had very short forelimbs in relation to its hind legs. The back legs each had three short toes, while the front legs had five toes. All four limbs were supported by pads behind the toes.

"Stegosaurus" was a member of the Thyreophora, or armored dinosaurs, a family of dinosaurs which includes the ankylosaurs.

"Stegosaurus" has been declared the State Dinosaur of Colorado. It has also appeared in many movies and TV shows.

<doc id="34620" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34620" title="Gregorian chant">
Gregorian chant

Gregorian chant is an important form of plainchant, used mainly in the Roman Catholic Church. With plainchant, all people sing the same music in unison, most of the time. Sometimes, there is a second part, called "organum", which often uses the same melody, but at an interval. This interval is often a fourth or a fifth. 

Gregorian chant developed mainly in western and central Europe during the 9th and 10th centuries, but people wrote new songs and changed the old ones later. Many people believe an old story, which says that Pope Gregory the Great wrote the songs. Most people who study the history of music believe that kings such as Charlemagne brought music from Rome to their kingdoms in France and Germany. When Charlemagne's people sang these songs, they changed the songs. This new music became Gregorian chant.

Usually men and boys sang Gregorian chant in churches, and holy women and men sang Gregorian chants in their daily prayers. In Roman Catholic churches, prayers and songs follow an order called the "Roman Rite." Gregorian chant is the music used in the "Mass" and the "Office" of the Roman Rite. The "Mass" is the part of the Roman Rite where Catholics share bread and drink together. The "Office" is the part of the Roman Rite where holy men and women pray at special times every day. In the past, people sang different songs in parts of Europe, but Gregorian chant replaced almost all of them. Although the Roman Catholic Church no longer requires people to sing Gregorian chants, it still says that Gregorian chant is the best music for prayer.

Christians have sung songs without music since the earliest days of the Church. Before the mid-1990s, many people believed that the Jewish songs called the "Psalms," which are in both the Jewish and Christian Bible, were an important part of early Christian music and prayer. People who study the history of music and religion no longer believe this, because most early Christian songs were not from the Psalms, and Jews did not sing Psalms for many centuries after their most important holy place, the Second Temple, was destroyed in the year 70. However, some parts of Jewish music and prayer ended up later in Gregorian chant. The organized order of prayers called "canonical hours" come from Jewish tradition. The words "amen" and "alleluia" come from the Hebrew language of the Jews. The prayer "santus, sanctus, sanctus," which means "holy, holy, holy," comes from the Jewish prayer "kadosh, kadosh, kadosh."

The New Testament, tells how Jesus and his friends sang together: "When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives" (Matthew|26.30). Other writers from those early centuries such as Pope Clement I also said that Christians sang religious songs, but they don’t tell us what the music sounded like. The "Oxyrhynchus hymn," a 3rd-century song from Greece has lasted with written musical notes, we do not know if this song is connected to plainchant.

The sorts of songs, which Catholics later sang in the Roman Rite, started to appear in the 3rd century. The "Apostolic Tradition", a book about Christian traditions in early Rome, says that Christians sang "Alleluia" in early holy meals called ""agape" feasts." Chants of the Office started in the early 4th century, when holy men in the deserts started the tradition of singing all 150 psalms every week. Sometime around 375, Christians in Eastern Europe started singing religious songs back and forth between two groups; in 386, St. Ambrose brought this tradition to Western Europe. Singing back and forth is called "antiphonal" singing.

Most people think that the liturgy of the Roman Mass was put together during the 7th century. In 785-786 Pope Hadrian I sent some Roman chants to the court of Charlemagne. Later this music developed into the system of eight modes. This music, together with some new chants to complete the liturgical year, became known as "Gregorian." This chant was probably named after Pope Gregory the Great. 

When Charlemagne had become Holy Roman Emperor he made everyone in Europe use this Gregorian chant. By the 12th and 13th centuries all other kinds of chant disappeared, even the Roman form (now known as Old Roman chant).
Gregorian chants are divided into three types based on the number of notes sung to each syllable. "Syllabic" chants mostly have one note per syllable. In "neumatic" chants there are mostly two or three notes per syllable, while "melismatic" chants have lots of notes for one syllable.. Some of the chants are recitative and some are free melody. When two choirs stand in different parts of the church and sing alternately these are called "Antiphonal chants". "Responsorial chants" are ones with a refrain sung by the choir, which alternate with a psalm verse sung by a soloist.
Gregorian chant used the eight modes which came from the Byzantine chants. They were written down in a special musical notation called "neumes". These neumes do not show the exact rhythms, so that we cannot always be sure of the way they were sung. The rhythm was probably quite free and flexible. There were certainly no bar lines and regular beat. The chant was normally sung by men. Women only sang in convents, and even then they could not sing in all the services. 

Gregorian chant was a big influence on polyphonic music in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. When the original plainsong melody was made to be the bottom part it became known as "cantus firmus" (i.e. the "given melody"). Cantus firmus became a very important part of musical composition in the Renaissance.

Lupus erythematosus

Lupus erythematosus, also called Lupus, is a disease. It is chronic, which means it does not go away. The Immune system is made up of white blood cells in your body that fight off disease. Lupus makes these white blood cells think that the healthy cells of the body around them are diseased, so they end up attacking healthy parts of the body. Lupus can be deadly. Lupus causes swelling and tissue damage, and can attack any part of the body. It most commonly affects the heart, joints, skin, lungs, blood vessels, kidneys and the brain/nervous system. Some symptoms include: fatigue, fever with no cause, hair loss, mouth sores, sensitivity to sunlight, a skin disease, and even Raynaud's syndrome. There is treatment for Lupus, called immunosuppression, which is medicine that stops the white blood cells from damaging healthy cells for a while. After a while, this medicine wears off, and then the white blood cells go back to hurting healthy parts of the body again. For the disease of Lupus, there is no cure that stops the white blood cells from attacking healthy parts of the body forever, but doctors are not giving up on finding a cure.

Lupus takes its name from the Latin word "Lupus", meaning wolf. This is because a Lupus-caused rash on a person's face makes the person's face look like the face of a wolf. In the United States alone, there may be 270,000 to 1.5 million (1,500,000) people with Lupus. Worldwide, it is estimated (not known for sure, but a good guess) that over 5 million (5,000,000) people living with Lupus. The disease mainly affects young women, but men can be affected as well.

<doc id="34669" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34669" title="Hiragana">
Hiragana

Hiragana are part of the Japanese writing system. Japanese writing normally consists of kanji which are used for the main words in a sentence, and hiragana which are used for the little words that make up the grammar (in English these would be words like “from” and “his”). Hiragana is also used for the endings of some of the words. 

Hiragana is a syllabary, which means that each hiragana character stands for a syllable. It is therefore different from a language such as English which uses an alphabet in which most of the letters stand for one bit of sound (phoneme). There is also another syllabary called katakana which is mostly used for foreign words and names. The two kana systems are quite easy to learn, but kanji takes years of practice. In contrast, the kana systems can be learnt in two weeks.

In the past hiragana was considered as women's writing, while men wrote in kanji. Since kanji suit well in Chinese language but poorly in Japanese language, it was the women who wrote the first Japanese books, poems and songs. Later the Buddhist clerics, such as Rennyo (d. 1498), wrote in hiragana to make the religious message easy to understand and everyone to read.

Sometimes the whole of a text may be written in hiragana to make it easy. This would be used in books for young children, or for students starting to learn Japanese, or when writing the lyrics for songs underneath the music where it is important to show how the words fit the music. Some rare or strange kanji may also have so-called "furigana" characters above it. They are hiragana which show how the kanji is to be pronounced.

In Hiragana each character (kana) is either a vowel (such as "a": あ); a consonant followed by a vowel (such as "ka": か); or, at the end of a syllable, an "n": (ん), although sometimes this sounds more like an “m” or “ng”.

As an example of how the grammatical endings are used we can take the verb “to eat” which is食べる (taberu). Here the main part of the word “eat” (pronounced “ta” in this case) is the kanji 食. The other two syllables: “be-ru” are in hiragana (べる). To say “I ate” or “you ate” etc you would say “tabemashita”, written食べました (“be-ma-shi-ta” is written in hiragana).

The main hiragana characters are shown in this table. 
Notice that the sound “hu” is unknown in Japanese, so ふ is pronounced “fu” with an “f” which is blown lightly.

To write the voiced sounds for “g”, “d”, “z” and “b” two little lines called a dakuten (゛) are added after a character starting with the unvoiced sounds “k”, “t”, “s” and “h”. A circle, (゜), is added after a “h” for the sound “p”. For example: は gives the sound “ha”; ば gives the sound “ba”; ぱ gives the sound “pa”.

Sometimes when words are joined together to make compound words, a sound changes from unvoiced to voiced. For example: “hana”: はな (nose) + ち“chi” (blood) becomes はなぢ “hanaji” (nosebleed)

Some Japanese syllables which have sliding sounds add a small version of the hiragana for "ya", "yu" or "yo" (ゃ, ゅ and ょ) This is called “yōon”. For example: “sha” sounds like “shi”+”ya” so “densha” (a tram) is written でんしゃ. A small “tsu” っ called a “sokuon” shows a doubled consonant: “Nippon” (Japan) is written にっぽん. Without the small “tsu” the first syllable would sound like the word “knee”. 

A student starting to learn to write Japanese can start with hiragana or with katakana. Hiragana is the basis of learning Japanese script. However, for someone who is about to visit Japan and just wants to be able to recognize a few words, katakana will be more useful as it will help to read many of the road signs, shop names and the names of things on restaurant menus.

Dark matter

We can use physics and mathematics to understand how strongly gravity affects something if we know enough about that thing, mainly how much weight it has. This way, we can understand how objects act on Earth.
However, astrophysicists have learned that the way things in deep space behave is different.

Many scientists have tried to understand why the rules are different in deep space. One idea is that we do not really understand gravity as well as we think we do. Another idea, which many think is more likely, is that there is something called dark matter. If you do calculations on the things in deep space with "extra" mass, then the rules work there too. So the idea is that there is more matter - stuff - in the universe than we thought. This is called dark matter because we can not see it, but if we assume the rules are right then it must exist.

Because dark matter does not seem to give off or reflect light, x-rays, or any other radiation, the instruments which can find normal matter (like hot gas, stars, planets, and us) are unable to find dark matter. It seems that dark matter is not made of the same thing as the matter we see everyday on Earth. The only way we can tell it is there is by how it affects things we can see by gravity.

In 2006, a group of scientists claimed they had found a way to observe dark matter. Since dark matter is supposedly very different from normal matter, it is expected to act differently. They observed two clusters of galaxies that had crashed into each other at high speed: normal matter would have got stuck behind after the collision, while dark matter would not. By measuring gravity they were able to detect what looks like two clouds of dark matter, with a cloud of normal matter (hot gas) in between them.

<doc id="34699" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34699" title="Katakana">
Katakana

Katakana is the way that some of the words are written in Japanese. It is much easier to read than the kanji (the picture method based on Chinese characters) which has to be learned word by word, because once the 46 katakana symbols have been learned the reader knows how to pronounce them.

Katakana and hiragana are both syllabaries. In English we use the letters of the alphabet. In most words each letter stands for a bit of sound (a phoneme). In a syllabary each symbol stands for a syllable. For example: in English we write “Wagamama”: each of the eight letters standing for a sound: “W-a-g-a-m-a-m-a”. But if the word “Wagamama” is divided into syllables there are four syllables (blocks of sound): Wa-ga-ma-ma. In Katakana it is written with four symbols: ワガママ. 

Hiragana works in the same way, but the symbols are mostly different. Katakana is perhaps a little easier to learn than Hiragana because the symbols are simpler and more “squared off”. Together Katakana and Hiragana are called “Kana”.

This is a table of the basic katakana strokes. The first chart shows the basic katakana (characters with red letters next to them are no longer used today).
From the first table it can be seen that there are 46 basic characters (top left, first five columns, from "a" to "wa"). Diphthongs (vowels that slide from one sound to the other) have to be written with an extra symbol in small print. For example: the sound “mu” in our word “music” sounds like “myu” so it is written ミュ (mi+yu). So the word “musical” (as in a stage musical) is written: ミュージカル.
A long vowel is shown in katakana by a kind of dash called a “choon” (ー).

Katakana is used to write words which have been borrowed from other languages, or to write foreign names and names of countries. For example America is written アメリカ.

It is not always easy for us to recognize these words because the Japanese language does not have some of the sounds that we do in English. This means that Japanese have to find other ways to pronounce and write the word. For example: the word “coffee” is written コーヒー (koo-hii). Sometimes the word is shortened as well: “television” is writtenテレビ (pronounced “te-re-bi”). 

Sometimes it is impossible to show the difference between two foreign words, e.g. ラーラー could spell either the name “Lara” or “Lala” (as in the Teletubbies). The Japanese have just one sound which is somewhere between our “r” and “l”.

In the Japanese language a consonant is always followed by a vowel. Words or syllables cannot end in a consonant (except n or m), so the Japanese put in an extra vowel. “Ski” (as in skiing) becomes “suki” (スキ), and a “musical”, as we have seen, becomes “myuujikaru” (ミュージカル).

Katakana are also used for onomatopoeic words like “ding”, or for making words look important, or for scientific names such as the names of birds. Sometimes sentences in books or cartoons may be written in katakana to show that someone is supposed to be speaking with a foreign accent. It is often used to write the names of Japanese companies, i.e. Suzuki is written スズキ, and Toyota is written トヨタ. 

A small “tsu” ッ called a “sokuon” shows what we would write as a double consonant, e.g. the English word “bed” is used in Japanese for a western-style bed. It is pronounced “beddo” and written ベッド. The ッ makes the “e” vowel short.

Learning to read the katakana characters is useful for reading some of the signs in Japan, or items on the restaurant menus.

Japanese sentences are usually written in a mixture of katakana, hiragana and kanji, e.g.:
アメリカ人です (amerikajin desu: I am American). Here “amerika” is written in katakana, the ending “jin”(人) is kanji, and “desu” (I am) is in hiragana.

Comb

A comb is a tool used to care for hair or other fibers. It has small pieces sticking out of a main frame; these are called "teeth." A comb is usually flat.

Humans have been using combs as a tool for a long time, at least for 5000 years. Combs are used by humans to separate tangled hairs, to keep their hair clean and to style their hair. They are also used as a decoration for hair.

Combs are used in the making of thread from fibers like wool or cotton. Combing makes all the fibres point the same way so a thread can be spun.

The first use of the comb was about 5,000 years ago. In fact, different kind of versions of the comb have been found throughout history by archaeologists. The ancient Egyptians carved out combs. In ancient China, combs were worn as hair decorations and accessories. Over time, combs have become into tools for taking care of hair. Today, there are hundreds of different kinds of combs.

Combs can be used to fix stray hairs and untangle wet hair. Another common use for the comb is to make hair be put in one position before tying it up. Combs may also be used to part hair for coloring, conditioning and braiding. Combs can also be worn as accessories that hold hair up in a special style.

Perfume

Perfume is a liquid that gives people and products a good smell.
Long time ago perfume was made for Toilet water and diaria. But recently, perfume is made for pleasure, fashion, trend etc. Both young people and old people use and enjoy this smell.

Perfume smells more when temperature is warmer. So people put it on the neck, wrist and back of the knee, because these parts are warmer. Perfume's smells change. Ten minutes after putting on perfume, we call this smell "TOP NOTE", twenty minutes is "MIDDLE NOTE", after this time is called "LAST NOTE". Speed and the way that the smell changes depends on each perfume.

In Asian countries, perfume is known as a part of cosmetic but not so Europe and America, because Asian like nutural smells due to cultural things. Result of this, use of perfume is not so high. Popularity goods are made in foreign country. 
Between 16th century and 19th century, European believed bathing is bad for health. so bathing was not common. Therefore perfume is developed to remove body smell.
To make a perfume, alcohol is needed. So before finding alcohol, people used oil and pomade. First perfume is made in Hungary and used in court. After that perfume was developed in Italy Renaissance period, and run over the Europe. 

The synonym of Perfume is essence,good smell or flavor.All thing have more or less some different perfume...and most interesting thing is that-human being also have his/her own unique perfume...if there are 6oo corer of people in the world than they all have the 600 corer types of perfume.

Magna Carta

The Magna Carta was a document signed by John of England and his barons after a meeting at Runnymede, Surrey, in 1215.

Magna Carta (Latin for 'Great Charter') is one of the most celebrated documents in English history. It solved, at the time, a conflict between King John and his main men: the barons and bishops. It had great influence on later English law. In the longer term, it is recognised as a cornerstone of the idea of the liberty of citizens.

Magna Carta contains 63 clauses written in Latin on parchment. Only three of the original clauses in Magna Carta are still law today. One defends the freedom and rights of the English Church, another confirms the liberties and customs of London and other towns. This clause (translated) is the main reason the Carta is still famous:

This clause limits the power of rulers, and introduces the idea of lawful process and the idea of a jury.

The origin is in the mediaeval feudal system, in which the King's word was law. Dispute grew between the barons and bishops and King John over taxes and disputes with the Pope. 

The barons chose their time to put John under pressure. John had lost a battle against the French, been excommunicated by the Pope (1209–1213), and feared civil war at home. He met the barons at Runnymede, 20 miles south-west of London, in June 1215. The negotiation was managed by John's half-brother, William Longspeé, and Elias of Dereham, steward to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Stephen Langton. 

The content of the Carta was designed to re-balance power between the King and his subjects, but especially between John and the barons. When King John set his seal on Magna Carta he conceded the fundamental principle that even as king he was not above the law. So, when King John put his seal to the Carta on 15 June 1215, that meant kings would not have as much power as before. The Carta also laid down rules of inheritance, and that convictions required some kind of official process. It stated that people rights not to be unlawfully imprisoned. In other words, the king is bound to rule within the law. 

Thirteen original copies of the Carta were made, and distributed. Only four survive today. The four copies are in The British Library, Lincoln Castle and Salisbury Cathedral. In 2009 UNESCO recognised it in its "Memory of the World" register.

The Magna Carta led to the constitutional rule of today. It was also an influence on the American Constitution and to the Bill of Rights. The Magna Carta was sent out again in 1220 by Henry III.

Catapult

A catapult is a type of machine used as a weapon to shoot rocks or other things that would cause damage to something else. Catapults use weights and levers to send the rocks or other things into the air. They are simpler than other modern weapons and not useful in modern warfare. Catapults were common in the past, especially the Middle Ages. Nowadays catapults are used to study old weapons or try using them for experience.

Sometimes, instead of rocks, pitch or hot tar would be thrown to set the target on fire. 

Often catapults were set on higher ground or on castle towers to let them shoot farther. They were also used to shoot rocks to break castle walls.

Minuet

A minuet is a dance which was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries in France. It was danced by the aristocracy, especially at the court of King Louis XIV.

Sometimes the French spelling menuet is used, or the Italian minuetto. It was a moderate or slow dance. There were always three beats in a bar (3/4 time).

Composers liked the music of the minuet and often wrote them just as pieces of music for a keyboard or other instruments. Composers like Bach and Handel included them in their suites (collection of dance movements). Lully started to put them in his operas, often in pairs: Minuet I, Minuet II, then Minuet I repeated. Often the second minuet would be played by three instruments, so it was called a trio.

In the Classical music period the minuet and trio were used in symphonies and sonatas. They usually formed the third movement of a four movement work. Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven all wrote minuets and trios. Gradually the minuets became faster so that they were called scherzos. By the 19th century the waltz had become fashionable among the new middle class. The polite minuet went out of fashion.

A Scherzo is a piece of music which is quite fast. In the 19th century Romantic composers started to write scherzos in their symphonies and sonatas instead of the traditional minuets. They are similar to a minuet, always with three beats in a bar, but they are faster and less "polite". Some composers like Chopin and Brahms wrote scherzos as separate pieces for the piano.

Chordata is a phylum (group) of animals which have a notochord. The group includes vertebrates, with some closely related invertebrates.


Note: Lines show likely evolutionary relationships. Extinct groups are marked with a "†". Extinct animals are ones that are not around anymore, but around in the past. 

A long-standing theory is that in transformed larvae of sea-squirts (tunicates) lies the origin of chordates. Tunicates are sessile, but their larvae are mobile, and have some features found in early vertebrates. The process of paedomorphosis, where juvenile features are retained in the adult, is the proposed mechanism. Genome analysis does show that the tunicates are the closest living relatives of vertebrates.

Tuscany is known for its landscapes and its artistic legacy. Six Tuscan localities have been made UNESCO protected sites: the historical center of Florence (1982), the historical center of Siena (1995), the square of the Cathedral of Pisa (1987), the historical center of San Gimignano (1990), the historical center of Pienza (1996) and the Val d'Orcia (2004).

Tuscany, bordering Emilia-Romagna to the north, Liguria to the north-west, Tyrrhenian Sea to the west, Umbria and Marche to the east, Lazio to the south-east. The territory is two thirds hilly and one fourth mountainous. The remainder is constituted of the plains that form the valley of the Arno River.

Tuscany is known for its wines (most famous of which are Chianti, Morellino di Scansano, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, and Brunello di Montalcino) and has 120 protected regions (nature reserves). Other agricultural products include Chianina cattle (particularly the famous "Fiorentina" steak) and the production of olive oil, principally in Lucca.

Tourism is the economic principally of the called "Cities of Art" (Florence, Arezzo, Lucca, Pisa, Siena, San Gimignano), as well as on the coast and in the isles (Elba).

In the '80s and '90s the region attracted an intense influx of immigrants, in particular from China and Northern Africa. There is also a significant community of British and Americans. As of 2006, the Italian national institute of statistics ISTAT estimated that 215,490 foreign-born immigrants live in Tuscany, about 5.9% of the people in Tuscany.

A few people who believed polygamy was an important part of their religion started the new church. They taught that a man needs more than one wife to be able to get to heaven. 

It is believed the church had about 10,000 members in 2009. These live in the sister cities of Hildale, Utah and Colorado City, Arizona; as well as Eldorado, Texas; Westcliffe, Colorado; Mancos, Colorado; Creston and Bountiful, British Columbia; and Pringle, South Dakota.

The church has been in the news because its leader, Warren Steed Jeffs was arrested in southern Nevada in August 2006. Jeffs was arrested because he was accused of rape and molestation. At the time, Jeffs was on the FBI's Ten Most-Wanted list.

There has been another incident in 2008. 
Beginning April 4, 2008, over a four day period, troopers and child welfare officials searched the church's ranch. They took 416 children into the temporary custody of the State of Texas. Originally officials from the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services took 18 girls into temporary custody of the state. They acted because of a phone call from the ranch- it looks like a 16 year old girl called the police to report she had been raped. She also said she had been married at age 15 to a 49-year-old man, Dale Evans Barlow. On the following day, Judge Barbara Walther of the 51st District Court issued an order authorizing officials to remove all children, including boys, 17 years old and under out of the compound. The children were being held by the Child Protective Services 45 miles away, north of the ranch. 133 women also voluntarily left the ranch with the children. The 16-year-old girl who alerted the authorities could not be located at the time of the raid. It looks like the call was made by a woman in her thirties, who gave a false identity. This woman is known by local police, as she has done similar things before. The woman was arrested for making the call (that triggered the raid) in April.

Biological classification

Biological classification is how biologists group organisms. 

The standard classification has its root in the work of Carolus Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. He invented the idea of giving each animal or plant two names, a genus, and a species. We are described as "Homo sapiens". It is always printed in italics like that, and no other way. 

These groupings have been revised to fit the Darwinian principle of common descent. Molecular evolution studies, which use DNA sequence analysis as data, has driven many recent revisions, and will continue to do so. Biological classification is a product of taxonomy.

The similarity between organisms placed in the same group or taxon is not arbitrary. It is a result of shared descent from their nearest common ancestor. So, the important attributes or traits for biological classification are those which are 'homologous'. That means they are inherited from common ancestors.

Homologous traits are separated from traits that are analogous. Thus birds and bats both have the power of flight, but this is not used to classify them into a taxon, because it is not inherited from a common ancestor.

In spite of all the other differences between them, the fact that bats and whales both feed their young on milk is one of the features used to classify both as mammals, since it was inherited from a common ancestor.

Taxa above the genus level are often given names based on the main ('type') genus, with a standard termination. The terminations used in forming these names depend on the kingdom, and sometimes the phylum and class, as set out in the table below.

An important alternative approach to biological classification is cladism. This approach is based on the branching tree of evolution. It uses characters (traits) to decide on the branches of the taxonomy.

Kingdom (biology)

Kingdom is the highest rank normally used in the biological taxonomy of all organisms. Each kingdom is split into phyla.

There are 5 kingdoms in taxonomy. Every living thing comes under one of these 5 kingdoms and some symbionts, such as lichen, come under two. They are:


Sometimes entries in the table, which are next to each other, do not match perfectly. For example, Haeckel placed the red algae (Haeckel's Florideae; modern Rhodophyta) and blue-green algae (Haeckel's Archephyta; modern Cyanobacteria) in his Plantae, but in modern classifications they are considered protists and bacteria respectively. However, despite this and other failures of equivalence, the table gives a useful simplification.

<doc id="34892" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34892" title="Digestion">
Digestion

Digestion is the way that an organism changes a substance into nutrients. This happens in the gastrointestinal system. Humans start digesting food in the mouth. Food is chewed by the teeth. Food is swallowed, which means it goes through the oesophagus. It goes into the stomach, where it is mixed with acid. 

After we swallow food, it travels down a muscular tube to the stomach. There, it is mashed into a mixture like soup. The mixture passes into the small intestine, where tiny bits of food pass into the bloodstream. The food that is still left goes into the large intestine. Finally, waste products leave the body. Digestion usually takes about 18 hours. Food stays in the stomach for about three hours. If uncoiled, the small intestine would be about six meters (20 feet) long. Most digestive tracts are about as long as a bus.

Food slowly enters the small intestine from the stomach. This is where nutrients are taken into the blood. It then enters the large intestine. Water is taken away from it. The food that is left is called feces. The feces are stored in the rectum until it can leave the body through the anus.

<doc id="34893" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34893" title="Sight">
Sight

Sight is one of the senses. Having sight means to be able to see. Seeing gives animals knowledge of the world. Some simple animals can only tell light from dark, but with vertebrates, the visual system is able to form images.

Light enters the animal's eyes, and a part of the eye called the lens sends information from the light to the back part of the eye called the retina. The retina is composed of light-sensitive cells which fire a signal down the optic nerve when light hits the cell. The optic nerve is a bundle of nerve fibres from all over the retina.

When the information from the light leaves the retina, it goes to the brain. It travels along the optic chiasma until it reaches the optic cortex at the rear of the brain. The information is then processed to find out the shapes and colours of objects. From that and from memory, it can tell of what kind the object is. For example, it can somehow tell a tree from a house. The path on which this kind of information flows is called "ventral stream". 

The brain can also tell where objects are. For example, it can tell how far away an object is (this is called hand-eye coordination). This is needed when catching a ball. The path on which this kind of information flows is called "dorsal stream".

The jejunum is a section of the small intestine between the duodenum and the ileum. It is between 1 and 2 meters long.The term "jejunum" derives from the Latin "jejunus," which means "empty of food," "meager," or "hungry." The ancient Greeks noticed at death that this part of the intestine was always empty of food. Hence, the name the jejunum. 

The Latin "jejunus" also gave rise to "jejune" means lacking in nutritive value and devoid of substance, significance or interest, that is dull. A jejune argument is one that is empty (like the jejunum) and totally devoid of interest.

Astrid Lindgren

Astrid Anna Emilia Lindgren, born Astrid Ericsson, (November 14, 1907 - January 28, 2002) was a famous Swedish writer. She wrote many books for children. She had a son named Lars.

Astrid Lindgren grew up in Näs, near Vimmerby, Småland, and many of her books are based on her family and childhood memories. However, Pippi Longstocking, her most famous character, was invented for her daughter Karin, who was, at the time, ill and had to stay in the bed.

Lindgren was the daughter of Samuel August Ericsson and Hanna Johnsson. She had two sisters. Her brother, Gunnar Ericsson, was a member of the Swedish parliament. She finished the school and took a job with the a local newspaper in Vimmerby. When she became pregnant with the chief editor's child in 1926, he proposed marriage. She did not accept, and moved to Stockholm, learning to become a typist and stenographer. There she gave birth to her son Lars in Copenhagen and left him with another family to care for him.

Although poorly paid, she saved whatever she could and travelled as often as possible to Copenhagen to be with Lars; often just over a weekend, spending most of her time on the train back and forth. Eventually, she managed to bring Lars home, leaving him in the care of her parents until she could afford to raise him in Stockholm. In 1931 she married her boss, Sture Lindgren (1898-1952). Three years later, in 1934, Lindgren gave birth to her second child, Karin, who later became a translator. The family moved in 1941 to an apartment on Dalagatan, with a view over Vasaparken, where Astrid lived until her death.

Astrid Lindgren died in 2002, at the age of 94.

In 1976, they had a scandal in Sweden when Lindgren's had to pay taxes 102% of her income. This is known as the "Pomperipossa effect" from a story, which she published in "Expressen" on 3 March 1976. 
Astrid Lindgren was well known both for her support for children's and animal rights, and for her opposition to corporal punishment. In 1994, she received the Right Livelihood Award (also known as the Alternative Nobel Prize), "...For her commitment to justice, non-violence and understanding of minorities as well as her love and caring for nature."

Some of her books include:

Cantabria is a region in the north of Spain which has 563,000 people living in it. In Cantabria most people speak Spanish. The people of Cantabria have autonomy in Spain which means they have their own local government and much control over their region. The capital is Santander. This city is on the coast of the Cantabrian Sea and is very popular with tourists. Cantabria belongs to the Green Spain, the name given to the strip of land between the Cantabrian Sea and the Cantabrian Mountains in northern Spain.

Many different examples of prehistoric cave art have been found, suggesting the Cantabrian culture is at least 15,000 years old. Cave art is the best known feature of the Cantabrian life. The latest round of systematic cave explorations began in the early 1970’s. Now new art can be discovered every year. Some of the care art is engraved and others are painted. Much of the cave art is of animals. There are often pictures of red deer found from this area of Spain. There are also other unusual symbols that can be found. This attracts much interest and many tourists to this culture. The Cantabrian life revolves mainly around art, tourism, and fishing. Rich deposits of coal, iron, and zinc are also mined in the Cantabrian Mountains. Tourism is a very large part of the Cantabrian life, and their economic success. 

Cantabria has a reputation for a rainy and cool climate. The region is also more green than southern Spain and is very mountainous.

L'Aquila is an Italian city.
It has about 71,989 inhabitants. It is the capital of Abruzzo.

It is on a hill in the valley of the Aterno river. It is circled by the Apennine Mountains. The Financial Times, an important newspaper, wrote that L'Aquila is "the most handsome city of Abruzzo".

It is a very old town, full of beautiful buildings and churches. It has a University.

Emperor Frederick II founded this town. He told the people of 99 villages to move in the new town. Frederick's son, Conrad IV of Germany finished the town in 1254. When Conrad died, his brother Manfred destroyed the town in 1259. Charles I of Anjou, king of Sicily, built it again soon.

It became soon the second city of the kingdom of Naples.

The city of L'Aquila had much power because the 99 original villages helped it. Each village owned a borough (a small part of the town) and the borough was a part of the mother-village. That is also why the number 99 is so important in the history of L'Aquila.

The people also built a very peculiar monument, the Fountain of the 99 Spouts ("Fontana delle 99 Cannelle").

The city was an important market for the countryside. The saffron (a very important spice) was grown in fields around town; shepherds had millions of sheep near L'Aquila.

After a few years L'Aquila became an important point of communication between cities in and out of the kingdom.

On August 29, 1294, the hermit Pietro del Morrone became pope Celestine V. The ceremony was in the church of Santa Maria di Collemaggio.

To thank the town, Celestine V decided that every year on that day every Christian who went to L'Aquila would be pardoned for his sins (bad actions). This is called Perdonanza, and it still happens every year on August 28 and 29. The Perdonanza is similar to the Jubilee Year, but arrived earlier.

The Perdonanza made the town more rich. But after a long time the plague (a dangerous illness) struck L'Aquila in 1348 and 1363. An earthquake struck it in 1349.

Saint Bernardino of Siena visited L'Aquila two times. The first time he came to preach to King René of Naples. In 1444 he died in the city.

In the 16th century, the Spanish viceroy Philibert van Oranje destroyed L'Aquila again. After this, he built a Castle.

Another earthquake damaged again the city in 1703.

The city is the home of L'Aquila Rugby. This team won the Italian championship five times.

Ankylosaurus

The Ankylosaurus ("Ankylosaurus magniventris") was a type of armoured dinosaur. It was the largest of its type, with a maximum size of 9 metres (30 feet). 

The body was broad and low-slung and covered in armour. Carnivores, attacking from above, would find no weak points, and the animal could defend itself by using its clubbed tail.

"Ankylosaurus" was a herbivore, or plant-eater. Because there was no grass in the dinosaur times, the Ankylosaurus probably ate ferns and low shrubs.

The most obvious feature of "Ankylosaurus" is its armour, consisting of massive knobs and plates of bone, known as osteoderms or bony scutes, embedded in the skin. Osteoderms are also found in the skin of crocodiles, armadillos and some lizards. The bone was probably overlain by a tough, horny layer of keratin. 

These osteoderms ranged greatly in size, from wide, flat plates to small, round nodules. The plates were aligned in regular horizontal rows down the animal's neck, back, and hips, with the many smaller nodules protecting the areas between the large plates. Smaller plates may have been arranged on the limbs and tail. Compared to the slightly more ancient ankylosaurid "Euoplocephalus", the plates of "Ankylosaurus" were smooth in texture, without the high keels found on the armor of the contemporaneous nodosaurid "Edmontonia". A row of flat, triangular spikes may have protruded laterally along each side of the tail. Tough, rounded scales protected the top of the skull, while four large pyramidal horns projected outwards from its rear corners.

Underneath it was covered by normal skin but, to get at it, the carnivore would have to turn over an animal weighing up to 6000 kgms (11,000 lbs).

It is roughly 1,450 kilometres long and 970 kilometres wide. It has an area of around 880,000 km² and a average depth of 110 m.

The Kara receives a large amount of fresh water from the Ob, Yenisei, Pyasina, and Taimyra rivers, so its salinity is very variable.

Its main ports are Novy Port and Dikson and it is important as a fishing ground although the sea is ice-bound for all but two months of the year. Significant discoveries of petroleum and natural gas, an extension of the West Siberian Oil Basin, have been made but have not yet been developed.

There is concern about the levels of nuclear waste the former Soviet Union dumped in the sea which included six nuclear submarine reactors and ten nuclear reactors, and the effect this will have on the marine environment.

Edvard Munch

Edvard Munch (12 December 1863 – 23 January 1944) was a Norwegian painter and print-maker. He was an expressionist. He is well known for his treatment of emotion such as fear. His way of seeing things had a large influence on the expressionism of the 20th century. People saw this treatment as being intense. 

Munch was ill very often. Some scientists think that he may have suffered from bipolar disorder (manic depression).

"The Scream" (1893; originally called "Despair"). This is Munch's best-known painting, and is one of the best known images in the world. It is one of the pieces in a series titled "The Frieze of Life". In the series Munch explored the themes of life, love, fear, death and melancholy. As with many of his works, he made several versions of the painting. One version was stolen from the "Munch-museum" in Oslo, Norway, on 22 August 2004, but on 31 August 2006 Norwegian police found it together with another picture that was stolen at the same time, "Madonna".

"The Frieze of Life" themes come back throughout Munch's work. These themes can be seen in paintings such as "The Sick Child" (1886, portrait of his deceased sister Sophie), (1893–94), "Ashes" (1894), and "The Bridge". The last-named shows limp figures. Those figures have faces witth no features, or they have no faces at all. Threatening shapes of heavy trees and houses are above the figurss. Munch portrayed women either as frail, innocent sufferers or as lurid, life-devouring vampires. Munch analysts say this reflects his sexual anxieties.

Sex education

Sex education is telling people about sexual intercourse. Usually, parents tell their children when they reach puberty. This usually includes things like how to make babies, how to protect against unwanted pregnancies, and how not to get any of the sexually transmitted diseases there are. In many cultures speaking about sex or sexual education is a taboo.

Some level of sex education is also done in school; in many places, the government passed laws that say that sex education must be done in school. Some parts of sex education vary by culture, eg. the moral and ethic aspects.

Tibet

Tibet, also called The Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and Xizang Autonomous Region ((Tibetan: བོད་ ; Wylie: Bod-rang-skyong-ljongs; Simplified Chinese: 西藏自治区; Traditional Chinese: 西藏自治區; Pinyin: Xīzàng Zìzhìqū, literally: "western depository" coming from the Chinese name for Ü-Tsang (simplified Chinese: 卫藏; traditional Chinese: 衛藏; pinyin: Wèizàng)), is a province-level autonomous region of the People's Republic of China (PRC). It's capital region is Lhasa.

Tibet's religion is Buddhism. Their traditions make it a place of to other countries. The local monks are sometimes said to have special, superhuman abilities. Whether or not this is true, the writings of Tibetan monks are sometimes shared with outsiders, and are for their insight. The "Tibetan Book of the Dead" contains rituals for the dead and dying, similar to the Catholic rituals.

The religious leader of Tibet's Buddhists is called the Dalai Lama. He was the ruler of Tibet before he was forced to leave the country when the Chinese army took over. The Dalai Lama presently lives in exile in India, but often visits other countries.

Tibet was independent until the 1950s (although no countries recognised it). Officially Tibet was part of China since the Mongolian Yuan Dynasty.

Tibetan culture also influences other regions nearby, such as Nepal, Bhutan, parts of eastern Kashmir and some regions in India, most notably Sikkim, Uttaranchal and Tawang . China claims part of the Indian province of Arunachal Pradesh as South Tibet.

There has been some protests in Tibet since China took control in the 1950s. Most of them have been because of social or economic problems. Some of them have been because there are people who believe Tibet should not be a part of China. A railway line, the Qingzang railway, has been built, linking China to Lhasa. Also, rising prices of food, and difficult access to higher education have angered many people. The railway line also raised fears about more migration. This situation has led to some violence against people from outside Tibet. Some of this violence occurs outside Tibet. When it comes to assigning government posts in Tibet, more Chinese seem to be assigned, and fewer Tibetans. The Chinese Government claims that if Tibet became independent again, its economy would suffer.

Air gun

An air gun is a gun which uses gas to fire a projectile instead of burning gunpowder that an ordinary gun uses. 

The oldest air guns used a spring to compress (squeeze) air in a tube. When the gun was fired the air was released. The only way for the air to go was by pushing the pellet out. A spring loaded gun can only fire one shot before the spring has to be reset. Newer guns use air or another gas in a small cartridge, these guns can fire many more shots before the cartridge needs to be changed or refilled.

The projectile for an air gun is usually a pellet. Some guns of this sort fire small round pellets call "bb"s. Some people think this means ball bearing, but it does not. The letters bb stood for a size of shot that was used to make shotgun cartridges, This was used in the first bb guns.

The most popular calibres (pellet sizes) for air weapons are mm (also called .177 to .22). In many countries there are strict rules that limit the sales of air guns so not everyone can have one. 

They are not as powerful as other guns but they can still kill people. 

Many people enjoy air rifle and pistol shooting either for fun or hunting. In the Olympics and Commonwealth Games air pistols are used in some of the shooting events.

Unit circle

In mathematics, a unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1. The equation of the unit circle is formula_1. The unit circle is centered at the Origin, or coordinates (0,0). It is often used in Trigonometry.

In a unit circle, where formula_2 is the angle desired, formula_3 and formula_4 can be defined as formula_5 and formula_6. Using the function of the unit circle, formula_1, another equation for the unit circle is found, formula_8. When working with trigonometric functions, it is mainly useful to use angles with measures between 0 and formula_9 radians, or 0 through 90 degrees. It is possible to have higher angles than that, however. Using the unit circle, two identities can be found: formula_10 and formula_11 for any integer formula_12.

Blackmail

Blackmail means threatening to say something bad about someone unless that person pays some money.

If someone has committed a crime, another person might blackmail them. The blackmailer might, for example, say that if the criminal does not give them a large amount of money they will tell the police.

A blackmailer may threaten to say something embarrassing about someone unless they hand over a sum of money. It may be something about a sexual relation they are having that they do not want everyone to know about.

Sometimes a business may blackmail another business. They might threaten to harm that business in some way unless money is paid.

Blackmail is illegal (against the law).
Blackmail started on the borders of England and Scotland. Blackmail was the money left out by landowners in England so that raiders from Scotland did not steal their animals or damage the property.

<doc id="35315" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35315" title="Bribery">
Bribery

Bribery means offering something (e.g. money) to a person in return for some favour which is bad in some way.

The money that is offered is called a bribe and the verb is to bribe.

It is sometimes difficult to decide whether something is a bribe or just a reward. If a father pays his son for washing the car, this is just a reward or payment. But if a parent pays a child for eating up its dinner this might be thought of as a bribe, because most people would think this was not right.

Bribery is usually about more serious cases in which a person offers money so that he does not get into trouble. If a motorist is caught speeding by a policeman and he offers the policeman money or a bottle of vodka to persuade him not to fine him, this is bribery. If someone wants to take something into a country that they are not allowed to take in (or that they would have to pay tax on) they might offer the customs officer a bribe to persuade him to let them through.

Examples such as these are clearly illegal (against the law) and would almost never happen in many Western countries. However in some parts of the world bribery is normal and it is difficult to do anything without offering bribes.

Bribery in some form is quite common in business in many parts of the world. Giving business people presents in the hope that they will want to do business with you may just seem like good manners at times, but in some cases it may seem more like bribery.

People who are found to be taking bribes can sometimes lose their jobs. In some cases (like the case of the motorist) bribery is against the law.

Rubella

Rubella (also known as German measles) is a disease caused by the Rubella virus.

It is often mild and an attack can pass unnoticed. However, this can make the virus difficult to diagnose. The virus usually enters the body through the nose or throat. The disease can last 1-5 days. Children recover more quickly than adults. Like most viruses living along the respiratory tract, it is passed from person to person by tiny droplets in the air that are breathed out. Rubella can also be transmitted from a mother to her developing baby through the bloodstream through the placenta. The virus has an incubation period of 2 to 3 weeks during which it becomes established.

The disease is named "German measles" because it has a similar red rash to measles and was first described in detail by German physicians.

<doc id="35327" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35327" title="Psychiatry">
Psychiatry

Psychiatry is a part of medicine that studies, diagnoses and treats mental illnesses and abnormal behaviours and conditions that cause problems and make life difficult for people. The people who practice psychiatry and treat others who have psychiatric problems are called "psychiatrists". 

Psychiatrists can prescribe medications to their patients to help emotional and behavioral problems; psychologists can only prescribe medication in Louisiana and New Mexico, which allows properly trained clinical psychologists to prescribe medication, with some limits. This is because of laws made by the government that say only medical doctors can prescribe.

Psychiatrists spend many years learning about how the body and the brain work. Psychiatrists must learn about all kinds of illnesses. Sometimes a disease in the body causes the brain to work poorly. Cancer in the Pancreas causes depression. Blood sugar problems in Diabetes Mellitus can cause a bad temper. These are only two examples. 

Psychiatrists spend many years learning how medications can help the brain work better. Psychiatrists also learn how medications sometimes cause problems to the brain. Sometimes psychologists send their patients to a psychiatrist if the patient seems to have a problem that medicine might help. The patient should continue to see the psychologist. 

In the 1950's, the first medicine to help patients with Bipolar disorder (formally known as Manic-Depressive Illness) was discovered. This was Lithium, a type of metal in a powder form. A bit later, the first medicine for Psychosis was discovered. Later, medicines to calm people (tranquilizers), to end depression (anti-depressants), to help feelings remain the same each day (mood stabilizers) were discovered.

Medicine for Mental Illness does not cure. Some of the medicines try to get brain chemicals to be the amounts they are in normal people. Other medicines "slow down how fast the brain works" so people with rapid thoughts can be in control of what they think and how they behave. When the medicines are stopped, symptoms often come back.

The best known Psychiatrist is Sigmund Freud, a medical doctor who was trained in Neurology. He became certain that hidden thoughts in the brain (which he called The Unconscious) could cause physical symptoms and strange behavior in some people. He believed that human behavior was not all caused by the brain, but by things that happened to people when they were babies and young children. His research of this theory -the idea he had- led him to create "talking therapy" -psychoanalysis- where he tried to figure out what could cause the mind to do things like this. 

He thought that his figuring things out and telling the patients what had caused the behavior would cure the patient. Unfortunately, it usually made no lasting changes. This is why psychiatrists (and psychologists) have gradually figured out many other ways of helping their patients.

Since the medications for mental illness were first discovered, there have been tools to understand why the mentally ill behave and think in ways that make it not easy for them to live. Doctors do this by studying the brain as directly as they can. 

This field of medicine is called NeuroPsychiatry. The medical doctors who work in the field are called NeuroPsychiatrists. They hope someday to really permanently cure or fix mental illness by finding ways to change the brain forever. In the meantime, they try to find ways to help by finding better medications.

The science of Psychology is studies the way people behave and change. Psychologists apply this what is found to make new ways of helping people change how they behave. Talking therapy and applied psychology were the first important ways of helping people with some problems of regular life. Some kinds of Mental illness can be helped some this way, but some kinds cannot be helped. They need medicines instead, then sometimes a psychologist can help the patient a great deal.

Stephen Colbert

Stephen Colbert is an American actor and comedian. He was born on May 13, 1964 in Washington, DC. He is the host of "The Colbert Report" on Comedy Central. Colbert uses a special form of comedy called satire to make fun of politicians and the news media. 

On "The Colbert Report" (which he pronounces IPA:[] to make the words sound the same), he pretends to be a right-wing talk show host. He likes to ask his guests very embarrassing questions that make it seem that he is a serious far right-wing conservative who is also not very smart. His TV personality centers on the idea that if enough people believe something, it will be true. This is largely based on conservative host Bill O'Reilly. In real life, Colbert is a liberal Democrat.

Many famous American politicians and people in the news media agree to appear on his show because it is very popular. Colbert started as a comedy writer and performer for many other programs, such as "The Daily Show" and the "Strangers with Candy" movie, both also on Comedy Central. 

He has also voiced Phil Ken Sebben and Reducto in Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law.

He grew up in South Carolina and went to Northwestern University.

Other examples of humor are satire, saying yes or no when it is not expected, and using different kinds of logic. People with different ages and cultures can find different things humorous. For example, adults may like satire, which children could find hard to understand. A comedian is someone who is paid to make people laugh. Famous ones include Alan Carr.

John Frusciante is an American musician. He was born on March 5, 1970 in Queens, New York. He was the guitarist of the funk rock band, Red Hot Chili Peppers. He has also made a number of solo records. Some of these albums have been made with other artists, for example Josh Klinghoffer. In December 2009 Frusciante claimed on his website that he had left the band over a year ago.

John Frusciante joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1988 after the previous guitarist, Hillel Slovak, died of a drug overdose. The band went on to record and release their fourth album, "Mother's Milk" in 1989. Following an international tour, Frusciante co-recorded the band's fifth album, "Blood Sugar Sex Magik". In 1992, he left the band because he was overwhelmed by the international success of "Blood Sugar Sex Magik". Frusciante abruptly announced his departure from the band just a few moments before a performance in Tokyo. He ended up playing the show and left quickly for a plane back to the USA.

From 1992 to 1997, he recorded a couple of solo albums, which received various criticism due to Frusciante's use of lo-fi and strange synthesizer effects. Frusciante released "Niandra LaDes & Usually Just A T-Shirt" in 1994 as a cure for there being "no good music around any more". From the time of being out of the band, Frusciante had started to experiment with drugs such as cocaine and heroin. In 1997, he released "Smile From The Streets You Hold" because he needed money for drugs at the time. He later took the album off the shelves as he did not feel comfortable with it being sold.

Band mate and long-time friend Flea asked John if he would like to rejoin the band in 1998. Frusciante was so overjoyed by the question that the band regrouped and started the recording process. In 1999, the band released "Californication". During the Californication tour, Frusciante recorded some more songs in what would eventually become "To Record Only Water For Ten Days", which was released in 2001. Frusciante returned to the recording studio in early 2002 in which they would later release the band's eighth album, "By the Way". Four Years later the Peppers released their ninth studio album, "Stadium Arcadium". In December of 2009 he announced that he would leave the Red Hot Chili Peppers and focus more on his solo albums.

After yet another world tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante decided to release some more of his own material between 2004-2005. During this time, John released six of his own solo records, some of which were co-written by Josh Klinghoffer.

John has used a wide range of guitars throughout his years with RHCP and as a solo artist. He is known for using a lot of guitars under the Fender brand. Below is a list of equipment that John has used through the years.

Charles Babbage was born in England, at 44 Crosby Row, Walworth Road, London. Babbage's father, Benjamin Babbage, was a banker of the Praeds who owned the Bitton Estate in Teignmouth. His mother was Betsy Plumleigh Babbage. In 1808, the Babbage family moved into the old Rowdens house in East Teignmouth.

Knowing that there were lots of errors in the calculation of mathematical tables, Babbage wanted to find a method by which they could be calculated mechanically, removing errors made by humans. Three different factors seem to have influenced him: a dislike of untidiness; his experience working on logarithmic tables; and existing work on calculating machines carried out by Wilhelm Schickard, Blaise Pascal, and Gottfried Leibniz. He first talked about the principles of a calculating engine in a letter to Sir Humphrey Davy in 1822.

Babbage's engines were among the first mechanical computers. His engines were not actually completed because he did not have enough money. Babbage realised that a machine could do the work better and more reliably than a human being. Babbage controlled building of some steam-powered machines that more or less did their job; calculations could be mechanized to an extent. Although Babbage's machines were large machines their basic architecture was very similar to a modern computer. The data and program memory were separated, operation was instruction based, control unit could make conditional jumps and the machine had a separate I/O unit.

Pavia

Pavia is a city in northern Italy. Pavia is in the Lombardy Region with 71.486 people living in it. It is a very old, historical city. It is 30 km south of Milan.

The town of Pavia (then known as Ticinum) was a big city and a special military area for the Romans.

Here, in 476, Odoacer won against Flavius Orestes after a long war. To make the city pay for helping his enemy, Odoacer completely ruined Pavia, but Orestes was able to escape to a city called Piacenza, where Odoacer followed and killed him, and removed from the throne his son Romulus Augustus. This is often thought of as the end of the Western Roman Empire.
A late name of the city in Latin was Papia (probably related to the Pope), which developed to the Italian name Pavia. Sometimes it's called Ticinum Papia, using both Latin names.
After the Lombards conquest, Pavia became the capital of their kingdom. During the Rule of the Dukes, it was ruled by Zaban. It continued to act as the administrative centre of the kingdom, but by the reign of Desiderius, it had fallen to a first-rate defensive work and Charlemagne took it in the Siege of Pavia (June, 774) assuming the kingship of the Lombards. Pavia remained the capital of the Italian Kingdom and the centre of royal coronations until the diminution of imperial authority there in the twelfth century.
In the 12th century Pavia acquired the status of a self-governing commune. In the political division between Guelphs and Ghibellines that characterizes the Italian Middle Ages, Pavia was traditionally Ghibelline, a position that was as much supported by the rivalry with Milan as it was a mark of the defiance of the Emperor that led the Lombard League against the emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who was attempting to reassert long-dormant Imperial influence over Italy.

In the time after that, Pavia was an important and busy town. Under the Treaty of Pavia, Emperor Louis IV gave the Palatinate to his brother during his stay in Italy. Pavia held out against the domination of Milan, finally yielding to the Visconti family, rulers of that city in 1359; under the Visconti Pavia became an intellectual and artistic centre, being the seat from 1361 of the University of Pavia founded around the nucleus of the old school of law, which attracted students from many countries.
The Battle of Pavia (1525) marks a watershed in the city's fortunes, since by that time, the former cleavage between the supporters of the Pope and those of the Holy Roman Emperor had shifted to one between a French party (allied with the Pope) and a party supporting the Emperor and King of Spain Charles V. Thus during the Valois-Habsburg Italian Wars, Pavia was naturally on the Imperial (and Spanish) side. The defeat and capture of king Francis I of France during the battle ushered in a period of Spanish occupation which lasted until 1713. Pavia was then ruled by the Austrians until 1796, when it was occupied by the French army under Napoleon.
In 1815, it again passed under Austrian administration until the Second War of Italian Independence (1859) and the unification of Italy one year later.

Perugia

Perugia (said "Pah-ru-zha" []) is the capital city of the region of Umbria in central Italy, near the Tiber River, and the capital of the province of Perugia. The city is located about 100 miles (160 kilometres) north of Rome. It covers a high hilltop and part of the valleys around the area. 
The history of Perugia goes back to the Roman Empire. However, major parts of the city have been destroyed, and rebuilt, due to many wars, plus earthquakes in the mid-1800s. In recent decades, the city has been known as a university town, with the University of Pergia (about 34,000 students), the University for Foreigners (5,000 students), and some smaller colleges, also. There are annual festivals and events: the Eurochocolate Festival (October), the Umbria Jazz Festival, and the International Journalism Festival (in April).

Perugia is a well-known artistic center of Italy. The famous painter Pietro Vannucci, nicknamed Perugino, was a native of Città della Pieve near Perugia. He decorated the local "Sala del Cambio" with a beautiful series of frescoes; eight of his pictures can also be admired in the National Gallery of Umbria. Perugino was the teacher of Raphael, the great Renaissance artist who produced five paintings in Perugia (today no longer in the city) and one fresco. Another famous painter, Pinturicchio, lived in Perugia. Galeazzo Alessi is the most famous architect from Perugia.
The city symbol is the griffin, which can be seen in the form of plaques and statues on buildings around the city.

Perugia was an Umbrian settlement but first appears in written history as "Perusia", one of the twelve confederate cities of Etruria. It was first mentioned in Q. Fabius Pictor's account, utilized by Livy, of the expedition carried out against the Etruscan league by Fabius Maximus Rullianus in 310 or 309 BC. At that time, a thirty-year "indutiae" (truce) was agreed upon; however, in 295 BC, Perusia took part in the Third Samnite War and was reduced, with Volsinii and Arretium (Arezzo), to seek for peace in the following year.
In 216 and 205 BC, Perugia assisted Rome in the Second Punic War. Little else is known until 41-40 BC, when Lucius Antonius (brother of Mark Antony) took refuge there, in the Roman civil war between Mark Antony and Octavian. Much of ancient Perugia was destroyed by Octavian (later became Emperor Augustus) after a long siege, and its senators were sent to their death. A number of lead bullets used by slingers have been found in and around the city. The city was burnt, we are told, with the exception of the temples of Vulcan and Juno. The huge Etruscan terrace-walls, naturally, can hardly have suffered at all. Afterward, the town, with the territory for a mile round, was allowed to be occupied by whoever came. It must have been rebuilt almost at once, for several bases of statues exist, inscribed with the words ""Augusto sacr(um) Perusia restituta"". However, the town did not become a "colonia", until 251-253 AD, when it was resettled as "Colonia Vibia Augusta Perusia", under the emperor C. Vibius Trebonianus Gallus.

Perugia is hardly mentioned, except by the geographers, until it was the only city in Umbria to resist Totila, who captured it and laid the city waste in 547, after a long siege, apparently after the city's Byzantine garrison evacuated. Negotiations with the besieging forces fell to the city's bishop, Herculanus, as representative of the townspeople. Totila is said to have ordered the bishop to be flayed and beheaded. St. Herculanus (Sant'Ercolano) later became the city's patron saint.
In the Lombard period, Perugia is spoken of as one of the principal cities of Tuscia. In the 9th century, with the consent of Charlemagne and Louis the Pious, it passed under the popes; but by the 11th century its commune was asserting itself, and for many centuries the city continued to maintain an independent life, warring against many of the neighbouring lands and cities: Foligno, Assisi, Spoleto, Todi, Siena, Arezzo, etc. In 1186, Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, "rex romanorum" and future emperor, granted diplomatic recognition to the consular government of the city; afterward Pope Innocent III, whose major aim was to give state dignity to the dominions having been constituting the patrimony of St. Peter, acknowledged the validity of the imperial statement and recognized the established civic practices having the force of law.
On various occasions, the popes found asylum, from the conflicts in Rome, within its walls, and it was the meeting-place of five conclaves (Perugia Papacy), including those which elected Honorius III (1216), Clement IV (1285), Celestine V (1294), and Clement V (1305); the papal presence was characterized by a peace-time rule between the internal rivalries. But Perugia had no mind simply to serve the papal interests and never accepted papal sovereignty: the city used to exercise a jurisdiction over the members of the clergy. Also, in 1282, Perugia was excommunicated due to a new military conflict against the Ghibellines regardless of a papal prohibition. In the other hand, side by side with the 13th-century bronze griffin of Perugia, above the door of the "Palazzo dei Priori" stands, as a Guelphic emblem, the lion: Perugia remained loyal for the most part to the Guelph party in the struggles of Guelphs and Ghibellines. However this dominant tendency was rather an anti-Germanic and Italian political strategy. The Angevin presence in Italy appeared offer a counterpoise to papal powers: in 1319 Perugia declared the Angevin Saint Louis of Toulouse "Protector of the city's sovereignty and of the Palazzo of its Priors" and set his figure among the other patron saints above the rich doorway of the Palazzo dei Priori. At the half of the 14th century, Bartholus of Sassoferrato, who was a renowned jurist, asserted that Perugia was dependent upon neither imperial nor papal support. In 1347, at the time of Rienzi's unfortunate enterprise in reviving the Roman Republic, Perugia sent ten ambassadors to pay him honour; and, when papal messengers sought to force it by foreign soldiers, or to exact contributions, they met with vigorous resistance, which broke into open warfare with Pope Urban V in 1369; in 1370 the noble party reached an agreement signing the treaty of Bologna and Perugia was forced to accept a papal legate; however the vicar-general of the Papal States, Gérard du Puy, Abbot of Marmoutier and nephew of Pope Gregory IX, was expelled by a popular uprising in 1375, and his fortification of Porta Sole was razed to the ground.
Civic peace was constantly disturbed in the 14th century by struggles between the party representing the people ("Raspanti") and the nobles ("Beccherini"). After the assassination in 1398 of Biordo Michelotti, who had made himself lord of Perugia, the city became a pawn in the Italian Wars, passing to Gian Galeazzo Visconti (1400), to Pope Boniface IX (1403), and to Ladislas of Naples (1408–14) before it settled into a period of sound governance under the "Signoria" of the condottiero Braccio da Montone (1416–24), who reached a concordance with the Papacy. Following mutual atrocities of the Oddi and the Baglioni families, power was at last concentrated in the Baglioni, who, though they had no legal position, defied all other authority, though their bloody internal squabbles culminated in a massacre, 14 July 1500. Gian Paolo Baglioni was lured to Rome in 1520 and beheaded by Leo X; and in 1540 Rodolfo, who had slain a papal legate, was defeated by Pier Luigi Farnese, and the city, captured and plundered by his soldiery, was deprived of its privileges. A citadel known as the "Rocca Paolina", after the name of Pope Paul III (Italian: Paolo), was built, to the designs of Antonio da Sangallo the Younger ""ad coercendam Perusinorum audaciam"."

In 1797, the city was conquered by French troops. On 4 February 1798, the "Tiberina Republic" was formed, with Perugia as the capital, and the French tricolour as flag. In 1799, the Tiberina Republic merged to the Roman Republic.

In 1832, 1838 and 1854, Perugia was hit by earthquakes. Following the collapse of the Roman republic of 1848-49, when the Rocca was in part demolished, it was seized in May 1849 by the Austrians. In June 1859 the inhabitants rebelled against the temporal authority of the Pope and established a provisional government, but the insurrection was quashed bloodily by Pius IX's troops. In September 1860 the city was united finally, along with the rest of Umbria, as part of the Kingdom of Italy.

Perugia has become famous for chocolate, mostly because of a single firm, Perugina, whose Baci (kisses) are widely exported. Perugian chocolate is very popular in Italy, and the city hosts a chocolate festival every October.

Perugia is the capital city of the region of Umbria.
Cities' distances from Perugia: Assisi , Siena , Florence 145 km, Rome .

Even though Perugia is located in the Central part of Italy, the city experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification "Cfa"), similar to much of Northern Italy.

In the 2007 population count, there were 163,287 people residing in Perugia, located in the Province of Perugia, Umbria, of whom 47.7% were male and 52.3% were female. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 16.4 percent of the population, compared to pensioners, who number 21.5%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.1 percent (minors) and 19.9% (pensioners). The average age of Perugia residents is 44, compared to the Italian nation-wide average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Perugia grew by 7.86%, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85 percent.

As of 2006, 90.84% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant group came from other European countries (particularly from Albania and Romania): 3.93%, the Americas: 2.01%, and North Africa: 1.3%. The majority of inhabitants are Roman Catholic.

Perugia today hosts two main universities, the ancient University of Perugia (Italian: "Università degli Studi") and the University for Foreigners Perugia ("Università per Stranieri"). "Stranieri" serves as an Italian language and culture school for students from all over the world. Other educational institutions are the Perugia Fine Arts Academy "Pietro Vannucci" (founded in 1573), the Perugia Music Conservatory for the study of classical music, and the RAI Public Broadcasting School of Radio-Television Journalism. The city is also host to the Umbra Institute, an accredited university program for American students studying abroad. The "Università dei Sapori" (University of Tastes), a National centre for Vocational Education and Training in Food, is located in the city as well.

The "comune" includes the "frazioni" of Bagnaia, Bosco, Capanne, Casa del Diavolo, Castel del Piano, Cenerente, Civitella Benazzone, Civitella d'Arna, Collestrada, Colle Umberto I, Cordigliano, Colombella, Farneto, Ferro di Cavallo, Fontignano, Fratticiola Selvatica, La Bruna, La Cinella, Lacugnano, Lidarno, Migiana di Monte Tezio, Monte Bagnolo, Monte Corneo, Montelaguardia, Monte Petriolo, Mugnano, Olmo, Parlesca, Pianello, Piccione, Pila, Pilonico Materno, Ponte della Pietra, Poggio delle Corti, Ponte Felcino, Ponte Pattoli, Ponte Rio, Ponte San Giovanni, Ponte Valleceppi, Prepo, Pretola, Ramazzano-Le Pulci, Rancolfo, Ripa, Sant'Andrea delle Fratte, Sant'Egidio, Sant'Enea, San Fortunato della Collina, San Giovanni del Pantano, Sant'Andrea d'Agliano, Santa Lucia, San Marco, Santa Maria Rossa, San Martino dei Colli, San Martino in Campo, San Martino in Colle, San Sisto, Solfagnano, Villa Pitignano.
Collestrada, in the "territorio" of the suburb of Ponte San Giovanni, saw a battle between the inhabitants of Perugia and Assisi in 1202.





Perugia has had a rich tradition of art and artists. The High Renaissance painter Pietro Perugino created some of his masterpieces in the Perugia area. The other High Resaissance master Raphael was also active in Perugia and painted his famous Oddi Altar there in 1502-1504.

Today, the "Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria" in Perugia houses a number of masterpieces, including the "Madonna with Child and Six Angels" (Duccio), which represents the Renaissance Roman Catholic Marian art of Duccio. Also, the private Art Collection of the "Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Perugia" has two separate locations.

The Collegio del Cambio is an extremely well preserved representation of a Renaissance building and houses a magnificent Pietro Perugino fresco.

Perugia has taken drastic measures against car traffic. At certain hours of the day, driving is forbidden in the city centre. Large parking lots are provided in the lower town, from where escalators lead up through the "Rocca Paolina" into the city. Since 2008, a MiniMetro has also been in operation, with seven stations.

Perugia railway station, also known as Perugia Fontivegge, was opened in 1866. It forms part of the Foligno–Terontola railway, which also links Florence with the "Roma Termini" railway station in Rome. The station is situated at Piazza Vittorio Veneto, in the heavily populated district of Fontivegge, about southwest of the city centre.

San Egidio Airport is located outside the city.

Perugia has twin and sister city agreements with the following cities:

Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a free operating system that uses the Linux kernel. The word "ubuntu" is an old African word meaning "humanity." It is pronounced "oo-boon-too".

It is one of the most popular Linux distributions and it is based on Debian Linux. The goal with Ubuntu is to make it easy to use and install onto a computer. Ubuntu can be used on all types of personal computers. Ubuntu is downloaded as a CD, which is free to download on the Ubuntu website. It can be installed or tested by running the CD.

Started in 2004, Ubuntu has been developed at a fast rate by Canonical Ltd., a company owned by a wealthy South African man by the name of Mark Shuttleworth.

Ubuntu splits all software into four different categories to show differences in licensing and the amount of support available. They are:

Free software here includes only software that meets the Ubuntu licensing requirements, which almost are the same as the Debian Free Software Guidelines. There is one difference for the Main category, however — it has firmware and fonts which cannot be changed, but are included if Ubuntu will not work right.

Non-free software is usually unsupported (Multiverse), but some exceptions (Restricted) are given for very important non-free software. Supported non-free software include device drivers that are needed to run Ubuntu on current hardware. The level of support in the Restricted category is less than that of Main, since the developers may not be able to get to the source code. It is wanted that Main and Restricted should contain all the software needed for a general-use Linux system.

Besides the official repositories is "Ubuntu Backports", which is an officially known project to backport newer software from later versions of Ubuntu. The repository is not comprehensive (meaning that it has parts missing from it); it is mostly made up of user-requested packages, which are accepted if they meet quality guidelines.

"LTS denotes Long Term Support"

Because there are several options for which desktop environment to use, Ubuntu is available in many different variants.

The official sister distributions which are fully supported by Canonical are:

Kate Moss

Katherine Moss (born 16 January 1974), better known as Kate Moss, is a British model.

She attended Ridgeway Primary School, then Riddlesdown High School but she was not noted for her academic success. She was found at the age of 14 by Sarah Doukes of the Storm Modeling Agency in 1988 while in an airport. Moss' career began when Corinne Day shot black and white photographs of her for British magazine The Face, in a photo shoot titled "The Third Summer of Love". 

Moss starred in a series of Calvin Klein in the 1990s, spurring a period of waify "heroin chic" in the modelling world. She was photographed with a blank face, as if affected by drugs or exhausted.

Moss charmed the fashion industry despite her height and has modelled for such elite houses including Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana, Burberry, Chanel, Missoni and Dior. 

Moss has been a supporter of the Breakthrough Breast Cancer charity, and in the 1990s featured in one of their target t-shirt campaigns. She also supported War Child. Moss also designed a charm in a necklace for Wallis in 2007 in aid of Cancer Research UK and said "I am happy to give my support to help fund crucial research, as so many lives are affected by this terrible disease".

She has also helped to launch the SamandRuby charity in March 2006. The charity was started to provide funding for the education and shelter of Thai children. The SamandRuby organisation is named after a friend of Moss's Samantha Archer Fayet and her 6 month old daughter Ruby Rose who were killed by the Tsunami while visiting Thailand. Moss also supports the Elton John AIDS Foundation, the Hoping Foundation, the Lucie Blackman Trust, Make Poverty History, Comic Relief and Homes of Hope which her close friend Sadie Frost also supports.

Moss checked herself into a psychiatric centre in 1998, claiming she was suffering from "exhaustion." She was suffering from depression over her separation from longtime boyfriend, actor Johnny Depp who was along with her from 1994 to 1998. 

On 29 September 2002, Lila Grace, her daughter with Dazed & Confused editor Jefferson Hack, was born.

On 15 September 2005, photos were shown in newspapers that seemed to show Moss snorting several lines of cocaine. Moss lost major modeling contracts with several international companies. 

She was able to continue her career after a detoxication and was on both the 2005 and 2006 list of Forbes The Celebrity 100.

Alesha Anjanette Dixon is a British singer and television personality. She was born on 7 October 1978, in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, England to an English mother and Jamaican father. She was a member of UK girl band, Mis-Teeq. She released her first UK solo album, The Alesha Show, in 2008.

Dixon's career began in 1999 when she met Sabrina Washington when they both joined "Dance Attic" (a popular dance class school in West London), and together they formed a duo and recorded a demo titled "Inspiration". During an audition, they met with Su-Elise Nash, and then together they formed a trio. They were soon signed to Telstar Records with the addition of a new member, Zena McNally, and became the popular Garage/R&B girl band, Mis-Teeq. They released their debut single "Why?" in 2000, and it was not long before founding member McNally left the band to pursue her own solo career. The band made a decision to remain a trio.

In 2001, they released their debut album "Lickin' On Both Sides", featuring hits "All I Want", "One Night Stand", "B With Me" and "Roll On / This Is How We Do It". In 2003, they released their second album "Eye Candy", featuring hits "Scandalous", "Can't Get It Back" and "Style". In 2004, Mis-Teeq toured the United States and released their debut single "Scandalous" from their American debut album "Mis-Teeq", a compilation of the albums "Lickin' On Both Sides" and "Eye Candy". They also released "One Night Stand" before coming back to Europe to start work with their third album. However, Telstar Records was shut down and the band was left with no choice but to have released a 'Greatest Hits' compilation right under exclusive licenses with Universal Recording Company.

Dixon appeared in the N*E*R*D* music video for "She Wants to Move", from their second album "Fly Or Die". The last song she recorded with her band was "Shoo Shoo Baby" for the Disney film "Valiant". In March 2005, they released their 'Greatest Hits' compilation and announced that they were separating each to pursue a solo career. Dixon later announced that she was signed with a ₤500,000 contract deal with Polydor Records and announced that she will work on material for her solo debut album. In summer of 2005, she married her long-time fiancé, rapper MC Harvey (formerly of So Solid Crew).

Dixon has spent an entire year preparing for her solo debut album, "Fired Up". In June 2005, she announced her single to be "Superficial", but the song leaked on illegally file sharing and the company stated her next single to be "Lipstick". She released her official first debut single "Lipstick" on 14 August 2006 and it went to #13 on the UK Single Charts. Dixon announced that she has worked with a wide arrangement of producers for her solo debut album, including Richard X, Xenomania, Johnny Douglas, Brian Higgins, and Paul Eppe. She has even worked on a song with famous UK rapper Estelle.

Dixon announced that her second single will be "Knock Down" a song she describes as a 'reggae-influenced' tune. The single was released on 30 October 2006. An album promo of "Fired Up" was released during the early weeks of September, it contained the tracks: "Lipstick", "Knock Down", "Ting-A-Ling", "Fired Up", and "Free", all which are expected to be on her debut album.

After "Knock Down" did not chart in the top 40 her record company dumped her, and "Fired Up" was not released anywhere except Japan. After winning Strictly Come Dancing in 2007 she made a comeback, in 2008 Alesha released The Boy Does Nothing, the lead single from her album The Alesha Show, she then released Breathe Slow which charted at #3 on the UK singles chart, her highest charting single yet.

The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (also called Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or simply Jekyll and Hyde) is a horror novella (a short novel) by the Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson. It was first published in 1886 in London.

"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" is well known for describing the mind and split personalities. The phrase "Jekyll and Hyde" is often used to mean behavior in which someone behaves very differently from their normal behavior.

Dr. Henry Jekyll, a respected doctor of medicine, believes that man has both good and evil sides. He creates a serum of a very special drug, which is supposed to separate the two different sides, and tests it on himself. The experiment fails, and Dr. Jekyll transforms into his evil self, Mr. Edward Hyde, who commits horrendous crimes in London.


"The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde" has been made into a movie many times.

Eroticism

Eroticism is the quality of sexual excitement. In other words, if something is sexually exciting, then it is said to be "erotic". Eroticism is an "erotic" feeling. It is named after Eros, the Ancient Greek god of love.

Many types of things can be part of "eroticism". Things that make a person feel erotic (sexually aroused or excited) include the sight, touch, smell, and sound of another person. A person may feel erotic when they see or touch or smell, or hear someone that they love in a sexual way. They may also have erotic feelings about a person that they do not love, but who is sexually attractive to them. 

Sometimes "eroticism" has nothing to do with another person. A person might feel erotic from watching a movie, looking at pictures in a magazine, listening to a piece of music, reading a story or article, or just thinking their own thoughts, or being aware of their own body. 

Some things are designed and made especially to make people feel erotic. Things that are designed to make people feel erotic are called "erotica". This word is most often used for art, books and magazines. 


Most people believe there is a difference between "erotica" and "pornography", but some people have argued that all "erotica" is "pornographic". (In other words, some people believe that all pictures, movies or writing which are sexually exciting are rude and wrong, and should not be made.) 

People who have studied this subject say that erotica is not harmful to anyone, and may be helpful with people's loving relationships. The same writers say that pornography, which generally shows a person being treated without respect or love, is not helpful with people's loving relationships.

Tarantella

A Tarantella is a very fast dance in 6/8 time. The name comes from the town of Taranto in Italy. People used to believe that if someone was bitten by a tarantula spider they needed to do this dance in order to drive out the poison. The dancer would get more and more excited until he (or she) seemed mad.

Some people think that maybe these people never really believed this, but that it was an excuse to dance at a time when the church said that dancing was not allowed. The spider is, in fact, only a little bit poisonous.

Some composers enjoyed writing fast pieces in 6/8 time which they called "Tarantella". Mendelssohn wrote one as the last movement of his Symphony no 4 (the Italian). Chopin and Liszt also wrote Tarantellas.

Steve Irwin

Steve Robert Irwin (February 22, 1962 – September 4, 2006) was an Australian wildlife lover and a television and movie star. He was famous for the television program "The Crocodile Hunter", a well-known real-life animal show that he made with his wife Terri Irwin. Irwin's character and adventures on his show made him an international star. The fact that he was a brave, courageous soul made him earn an even greater following. He also owned and ran the Australia Zoo at Beerwah in Queensland.

Steve Irwin was killed by a piercing of a barb of a stingray (a type of sea creature) on September 4 2006 while he was making a documentary. He was 44 years old when he died. It was a tragedy and many people mourned his death.

Irwin's mother and father were Lyn and Bob Irwin. Irwin was born in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The family moved to Queensland in 1970, when Irwin was 8. Bob Irwin was very interested in reptiles (a type of animal that includes snakes and crocodiles). When the family moved, Bob and Lyn Irwin started the small "Queensland Reptile and Fauna Park". Irwin lived here until he became an adult.

Irwin worked in his family's park while he was nine, feeding the animals, and taking care of the grounds. He began working with crocodiles when he was nine, and became a crocodile-trapper (someone who traps crocodiles without killing them) when he was older. Irwin trapped crocodiles that were near places where people lived, and kept them for the park. He also worked for free for the Queensland Government's "East Coast Crocodile Management program".

Irwin became head of the park in 1991 and changed the name to "Australia Zoo". In 1992, at the Zoo, he met and married Terri Raines. As part of the marriage event, Irwin and his wife went on a journey to trap crocodiles. The journey was recorded for television and became the first part of the television show "The Crocodile Hunter". This show made Irwin famous. "The Crocodile Hunter" has been seen by people in 120 countries across the world, and has a large number of fans (people who like it very much) in the UK and Australia. 

Irwin made the zoo larger by adding the "Animal Planet Crocoseum", a place where rainforest birds can be seen, and the "Tiger Temple". He also started the "World Wildlife Warriors" (which was named the "Steve Irwin Conservation Foundation"), an organization that tries to preserve rare animals that are in danger of dying out.

At about 11:00 a.m. Australian eastern standard time (01:00 UTC) on September 4 2006, Irwin was cut in the chest by the tail of a stingray (a large sea animal) while snorkeling (a way of swimming using a tube to help you breathe under water) in Batt Reef, near Port Douglas in Queensland, Australia. He died from the wound. At the time, Irwin was being recorded for a television show, "The Ocean's Deadliest". Bad weather had stopped recording and Irwin took the time to record some different pictures for another program. Irwin's friend, John Stainton, was on Irwin's boat. Stainton says Irwin swam too near to one of the animals - "He came on top of the stingray and the stingray's barb "(a point on the stingrays' tail)" went up and into his chest and put a hole into his heart". His wife (Terri Irwin) did not find out about his death until a few hours later because she was trekking in Tasmania.

Ruler

A ruler is an instrument of measurement. Rulers measure length. Length is how long or short something is. Most rulers work by having numbers (parallel to the measuring edge) and little lines (perpendicular to the measuring edge). Rulers can also be used as a straight edge to draw lines with.

Rulers come in many different forms. They can be made of plastic, wood and metal, and other materials. Rulers also come in a variety of lengths. For example, there are 1 metre rulers, 30 centimetre rulers, 20 centimetre rulers and 15 centimetre rulers. These are examples of metric rulers. You can also get 1 yard rulers, 18 inch rulers and 6 inch rulers, etcetera. These are examples of imperial rulers.

Mutation

In biology, a mutation is a change in the genetic material. This means changes to the DNA or to the chromosomes which carry the DNA. All such changes are heritable (can be passed on to the next generation) unless they have lethal effects. 

Mutations can happen for several reasons. It can happen because of errors when "meiosis" produces the gamete cells (eggs & sperms). Damage by radiation, or by certain chemicals may cause mutations, but they do occur occasionally at random. 

Also, by derivation, an individual carrying the mutation may be called a mutant or a "mutation". So is the trait (character) most obviously affected by the mutation. 

When DNA is copied mistakes are sometimes made – these are called mutations. There are four main types of mutations:

These terms are explained in the third diagram.

Mutations may be bad for the organism, or neutral, or of benefit. Sometimes mutations are fatal for the organism – the protein made by the 'new' DNA does not work at all, and this causes the embryo to die. On the other hand, evolution is moved forward by mutations, when the new version of the protein works better for the organism.

Mutations are the ultimate source of variation, upon which "natural selection" acts. What happens is that some mutations affect the organism's ability to live and reproduce. This is an important part of the theory of evolution. The amount of heritable variation carried by a population can be huge, and as a consequence natural populations have the capacity to change and adapt to conditions in their environment.

Stingray

The stingrays are a large suborder of the rays. They are cartilaginous fishes related to sharks. They are classified in the suborder Myliobatoidei of the order Myliobatiformes, and consist of eight families. 

Most stingrays have one or more barbed stings on the tail, which is used "only" for self-defense. The stinger may reach a length of approximately 35 cm, and its underside has two grooves with venom glands. The stinger is covered with a thin layer of skin, the integumentary sheath, in which the venom is concentrated. A few members of the suborder, such as the manta rays and the porcupine ray, have lost their stings.

There are eight families in the stingray group. They are:

Stingrays are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine waters throughout the world. They also include species found in warmer temperate oceans and in the deep ocean. 

The river stingrays, and a number of whiptail stingrays live only in fresh water. Most myliobatoids are demersal, but some, such as the pelagic stingray and the eagle rays, are pelagic.

Stingrays settle on the bottom while feeding, often leaving only their eyes and tail visible. Coral reefs are favorite feeding grounds and are usually shared with sharks during high tide.

The flattened bodies of stingrays allow them to hide themselves. Stingrays agitate the sand and hide beneath it. Because their eyes are on top of their bodies and their mouths on the undersides, stingrays cannot see their prey. They use smell and electro-receptors similar to those of sharks. 

Stingrays feed mostly on molluscs, crustaceans, and occasionally on small fish. Some stingrays' mouths contain two powerful, shell-crushing plates, while other species only have sucking mouthparts. 

Stingrays are ovoviviparous, bearing live young in 'litters' of five to thirteen. The female holds the embryos in the womb without a placenta. Instead, the embryos absorb nutrients from a yolk sac, and after the sac is depleted, the mother provides uterine 'milk'.

At the Sea Life London Aquarium 2 female stingrays have delivered 7 baby stingrays, although the mothers have not been near a male for 2 years. "Rays have been known to store sperm and not give birth until they decide the timing is right".

Like all fish, stingrays sometimes get little parasites (such as flukes or copepods) on their gills or body. A cleaner fish helps the stingrays by eating those parasites it can get at.

Hi. I was wondering if:

1. A "#R" (Redirect) button could be added to the right of the "Horizontal Line" button. I find it rather beneficial, and the regular English Wikipedia already has it.

2. Nobody is in the #wikipedia-simple IRC Chat room. Do you think if the link to the chatroom was visible from the front page, people would start going in there?

3. Can anybody offer incentives to get others to start editing here, and our present members to edit here more?

4. Is the Simple English Wikipedia really reaching the intended audience? How do we know for sure? What is our traffic ranking?

-- 04:16, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

OK, here's what I think:


As far as IRC goes, I have it open 24/7 and very few people use #wikipedia-simple. #vandalism-simple-wp attracts a great deal more people, but still not that much. Perhaps a more prominent link would bring more people to the channel, but perhaps not.
Page load counting was phased out with the 1.5 version of MediaWiki. I've yet to see anyone discover an alternative at any of the wikis I edit. A counter, especially the graphic ones, are a small bit... tacky, but if it gets the job done... *shrug* -- 19:14, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

The display of links is broken in Firefox for Mac—words overlap each other. The CSS must be fixed. 03:37, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

 * Main Page
I have never seen the word "newest" before it popped up in the menu in this wiki. Why not use the phrase "New changes" or something else? 20:52, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

When I came about a question on Karl Marx, I imported the external references of the English article on Marx. This also refers to Wikiquote. As it has been pointed out by , there could be a simple wikiquote, which gives the quotes in full (like en wikiquote, but which includes explanations, like background, difficult words, etc.)

So the question is: Should we create a simple wikiqoute, or should we only refer to the en wikiqoute (which may be unsimple)?

IMO we do not have the manpower atm to run a simple wikiquote, though it would have its merit.
-- 12:34, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

I think that we can afford the luxury to leave localised (ie. British, American, Indian, South African..) forms of English as they are. In real life, our target group will also encounter different forms how a word is spelled. Therefore, attempts to correct flavour (to flavor) are imo not the best edits. -- 11:02, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

Some of you may of heard of the project going on at the moment to produce good quality articles in PDF form intended to be downloaded and printed.

I think the Simple English Wikipedia would get the greatest benefit from publishing our core articles only in printed form. This would mean that copies of our encyclopedia could actually find its way out into the world, rather than just serving the vandals. The majority of our target audience don't know we exist, yet the majority of vandals seem to. The way to solve this is to get out hard copies.

Unfortunately, we are not at a stage where we can even look at printing anything other than our core articles for various reasons, so here's what I suggest:


I know it is a huge project, but I think it could be done if we put the effort in. Think about it: we put all this work into an encyclopedia, for it to go relatively unnoticed. I think that if we want to see our hard work out there making a difference, this is the way to go. We could make one hell of a difference. 15:51, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

Hello, I fully agree that the possibility do download a certain article in PDF form, or to even have a searchable (off-line) medium (like a DVD or a CD) that could contain the articles would be a great thing to see.

However, I think the following must happen:

So, yes, I agree with what Archer7 said above. -- 16:12, 1 May 2006 (UTC)


Before you start this, you need to decide who the target audience is. Who is going to want this wikireader? Are you going to sell it or give it away free? Are there any organisations who would sponsor it? How is it going to be promoted? Who gets to decide what the final content is? 12:33, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

The page footer doesn't say that Wikipedia is a registered trademark, like the main English Wikipedia does. Shouldn't this be changed? Perhaps more seriously, is marked as being GFDL, when it's explicitly not (it's copyrighted to the Wikimedia Foundation). 18:20, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

I noticed that we were one of the few Wikipedias without a Mozilla search plugin, so I wrote one. It's currently awaiting approval, and should be appearing on Mozdev very soon. I hope this will help us grow as an encyclopedia. 16:23, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

Do you think we should have featured articles like the big Wikipedia? I think we should, I was writing by latest article Deliverance and thought of how I was typing it, and was thinking about examples of good pages, bad pages and when they made fun of us on Something Awful (so that we can stop that from happening again), Some pages like Bulbasaur (He's Ash's best friend) and Romeo and Juliet (it's got Leonardo Dicaprio and cars and stuff!) are what I'm talking about.

I saw a red link and created a new article to fill the void. There's not much there yet, and I'm not too happy with what I've written. Could someone please look at it and perhaps make some suggestions? I'm worried that the style and tone come across as patronising, and that there is too little content. I've never tried to write in simple English before, and it's a lot harder that I would have imagined. As I understand it, the content can be as advanced or as complicated as it needs to be, provided the language is easy to understand. The article hasn't achieved this yet, but with some help I think I can get it to a point where it's acceptable. -- 05:57, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

Recent vandalism has needed to find out IP addresses of vandals. This would help us stop vandalism from more advanced vandals more quickly. Please say whether you support or oppose the two users . 21:18, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

I like this design better. I think it's even better than the original English Wikipedia's, but that's my opinion. Not only is it child-friendly, but I believe it's more universally aesthetically pleasing also. Lets hope the SE Wikipedia grows even faster. Again, nice job. -- 15:26, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

It's not simple. In fact, it appears to be a copy/paste from the original English Wikipedia. Can someone do something about Baseball please? -- 15:27, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

Go into your , and switch your Language preference to "en - English". This will restore the standard messages. There used to be a "simple - Simple English" option, but that seems to have been removed. In any case, "en" and "simple" give the same result. -- 15:58, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

I currently have a big problem with , our bureacrat, and I would like your comments.

Background: has created a deletion template with a reason input, and nominated for deletion, as circumstances have now changed since its last nomination. has reverted Cromwellt's edits without explanation, deleted Simple English Wiktionary and removed references to other Simple wikis because he believes the projects are worthless, and has attacked Cromwellt at every turn. While we were discussing this project's direction, I invited Netoholic to comment. He did not, and is now destroying any efforts to implement Simple English Wiktionary. He has even removed the links to other simple wikis from the Recent Changes template.

On the 26th of May, Netoholic left this on Cromwellt's talk page, after he had renominated a page for deletion. I thought this was incredibly rude, and asked Netoholic to explain . I received no reply, yet Netoholic continued to revert Cromwellt's edits. This went on for some time, until Netoholic turned quite nasty. I told Netoholic to calm down, yet he continued to revert and attack Cromwellt. I blocked Netoholic for 24 hours for such bad behaviour. I have since found a few interesting entries in . He has ignored all of our discussions here regarding the other projects, and nominated all three other Simple English projects for closure, without even notifying any of us.

He should not be our bureaucrat.

Here's what I want to happen:


I am obviously furious about this, I would appreciate everyone's comments. | 13:08, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

Please help my movement to make userboxes on Simple English Wikipedia! -- 18:20, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

I know of at least 4 SE admins who have agreed that Userboxes are more trouble than they are worth and are not allowed on SE Wikipedia. They are an immense distraction and impossible to maintain with our limited resources. -- 04:02, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

Hello I started this as a response to the "Netoholic" section above. First, let me state, that I am unaware of a way to sort out disputes between administrators, especially if both of them claim to be the one who is right. I think the main thing to see about doing something which has more impact is consensus. I do not think that a "straw poll" on which of the two admins has a more legitimae position is the right thing to do either.

So instead of throwing dirt at each other, we should take this chance to get at least a guideline how to do such things here.

For the time being, is our bureaucrat. He had this position when I came here (End of Nov 2005). I assume he got that position for what he did here. When he was elected, the users that were active then, probably had a reason to elect him. However, since I have been here, Nethoholic has not been overly active, at least not in areas well visible to the public.
He also has remained noticeably silent about this conflict, perhaps in an attempt not to escalate things.

The blocking of an administrator through another admin came as a surprise to me. Personally, I do not see the comments made by Nethoholic as insulting as Archer7. Archer7 might have overreacted, or misjuded the gravity of the situation. However, let us assume that his judgenment was right, and his reaction adequate. What tools did he have to calm down the conflict? - The bloking was more or less the only tool (here in wp, not counting email). Since Netoholic was blocked "to calm down" the same decision should have been taken for Archer7 (who was in a similar state of mind).

That the decisions that infuence this project (namely, to discontinue SE Wiktionary) are taken at meta, and not on SE Wikipedia (which is probably most affected by this) are unfortunate. The only thing that could be changed in the short run would be to mention such votes going on (and decisions being taken) here on the talk page.


Of course, all comments are welcome -- 11:09, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

I really have no idea where best to put this (anyone should feel free to move it if they think there's a better place for it), as related discussions are all over the place, but here goes.

Where to go from here is difficult. As for SE Wikt, I think SE Wiktionary should keep it's links from here until/unless it is shut down via a consensus decision following the discussion at Meta. Similarly, to me there seems little point in changing related policies and guidelines "here", until that decision has been reached. As for dispute resolution, there does appear to be a need for a less drastic medium than a block. And there seems to be a need for a way to get notices of related Meta discussions posted here more reliably. 03:07, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

It looks like it comes down to me, to decide what to do. So I expect the rest of the commubity to at least comment of what I did. It looks like this conflict was sparked by a misunderstanding. Cropmmwellt seems very much committed to SE Wiktionary, and in thze spirit of that, didn't see the value of a wordlist, and therefore nominated it for deletion. Nethoholic, based himself on the decisions made in meta (which was not communicated enough here) and did everything he could to oppose the deletion of the wordlist. Crommwellt's other activities on this wiki are mostly related to wiki-internal discusssions, templates and policies. Actual edits of articles seem to occur less frequently.

This whole back and forth seems to have started around January of this year. Based on this, Netoholic left the messages that seem to have led Archer7 to apply his 24 hour clam down block. 

Archer7, on the other hand, did not have many options, so given the state the relationship betweeen Nethoholic and Crommwelt was in,he applied the block. From my point of view (I may be wrong) this was the only in-wiki option he had (I don't know and I also dont want to know about email exchange). Since he was pretty emotional about this himself, he more or less stayed away from Wiki for about the same period of time. 



-- 09:44, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

I can see this is going nowhere. I can't say these issues are resolved (far from it), but after 15 days I've calmed down enough to resume my activities over here. We are obviously not going to make any progress here. | 09:21, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

Anyone know why the "240px" command is being ignored at John Adams, or how to fix it short of adding a "size" variable to pass to ? 02:16, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

If I'm logged in, it just says "From Wikipedia" at the top of all the pages instead of the long message (I forget the wording), and I don't see the 'from Commons' text/links on the Image pages, and I don't get the 'check for double redirects' text and links after moving a page. WTF? 03:23, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

Please tell me who inserted the giant human phallus on the main page, so I can yell at him on the talk page. Thank you in advance. 16:51, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

And I speak abkhaz, so please put it back the way it was.

Especially since we have relatively limited editor-hours available, and by policy we rely entirely on Commons for images, this seems particularly useful for us, so I've submitted a request. Most of the other relevant info is on (or linked from) . A useful example of the info provided by the tool is . Just a few hours ago I found an image redlink on one of our pages caused by a deletion at Commons which is the sort of thing that is reported by the tool that is good to know. 02:10, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

I think everything is in Russian... 07:47, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

D'oh!!! my bad!! :D. i somehow managed to set my preferances to "preferred language - Russian"... sorry for yelling at the sandbox and everbody else and generally being an idiot... please ignore me.

I'd like to act as an abuse investigator and contactor (see ) for all of the Simple English projects. This would involve investigating abuse from IPs and compiling this into a report, then contacting ISPs and requesting their assistance. I've done it twice before, but I'd like to make it a bit more official so people know where to go when things get really bad.

Any thoughts or objections? | 09:36, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

I really think we need a page on . That page would be mostly for pages deleted without going to RfD which should not have been deleted. It would work the same way as RfD, just do the opposite process, just like it works on . I already have one page to put on it: Project Gutenberg. Maybe it should have been cleaned up/simplified, but Project Gutenberg is a valuable and well-known repository of online books in multiple languages, and definitely deserves to have a page. Obviously, discussion is more than welcome. That's why I put the comment here, rather than make the page myself. --|| 21:02, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

I agree that here and talk pages are the current methods of requesting undeletion, and I think they are reasonable for the moment given our size. Edit counts are not a way of measuring how useful a user is to a project. Telling users to go on articles or walk away is not acceptable. You are welcome to come to Wiktionary and help us build policies to make it work better, or even help us ad content to make it 'not suck'. Please be nice to other contributors. Now I've said I'll stay out of this, so it's up to everyone else now. | 20:05, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

I think this information should be made available, as it has direct bearing on the discussion regarding Netoholic:

The major changes to policy in the past have been made by Netoholic himself. Angela has imported some policies and simplified them, but hasn't changed anything, though she did discuss some differences long ago on . Netoholic has changed "many" policy, guideline, and help pages to reflect his vision of the project, "without asking for the input of others". Then he tells others that that's the way it is, based on the pages that he himself has changed. Nice system, don't you think? I don't know the technical word for that, but it isn't right. One of the most obvious is , where all of the major changes (new sections, etc.) are his work. Sure, he's been here longer than I have, but I don't need tenure to know a problem when I see one. Do we want an admin that uses tactics like this? Actually, Netoholic's edits to the Wikipedia: namespace (566 at last count) dwarf mine (186), though I admit that the proportion of total edits is much larger in mine. Funny how he gets on my case for having more edits on the Wikipedia: namespace than in the main namespace, when he has more "deletes" than edits to the article namespace. While it is true that there is plenty of vandalism to undo, it can't all be vandalism. Additionally, deletes are of a whole page, while edits may be to a single word or less. Are we sure we want an admin (not to mention bureaucrat) who deletes more than he contributes? As I mentioned earlier, I'm not questioning if he should be an editor, just if he should be an admin/bureaucrat. If one is removed, the other must be also. --|| 20:33, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

I've left a on a talk page of a suspected sockpuppet giving people some idea of the possible consequences of vandalising Wikipedia, and I'd like to make it a template for use on people we suspect are going to start massive sockpuppet attacks or have already done so, to let them know what they are possibly in for before we have to do something drastic. It would only be for use in those circumstances, as it does sound very mildly threatening as the people it would be given to would need a stern voice. I just think that most vandals have no idea what they could be in for before they've gone in too far. Let me know what you think, I think this one needs to be discussed. | 19:53, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

I think the following would be useful:

Just an idea if you're interested. The spam we get on is from IPs across the world. Of course this could just be one person using a proxy, but could it possibly be a bot designed to send out a list of sites to a set list of pages? Our spam is always in exactly the same place, but it can vary from massive PPC search engine links to a single link. I'll try to track it down (although I don't really know what I can do if I find something). | 09:55, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

Hi, I am user . I make the newsletter Wikizine. The target audience is for everybody of the Wikimedia community, especially the non-English members. My newsletter is written in English. My command of English is not very good but nevertheless I seem to be using sometimes words that are not even commonly know by English speakers. I am willing to do an experiment and try to write Wikizine in Simple English. It must be easy to do, I can not spend a lot of time on this. Wikizine is basically a one man show so things must advance quickly. I have found this online to check the text;

There you can select different wordlists. I would like advice about what wordlist I best can use. I want tho make the text more easy to read but not to change it in to baby talk. Greetings, -- 22:02, 30 June 2006 (UTC)


The main lists you can use are the BE850, BE1500 and Special English. | 20:19, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

I'm thinking of running a bot for general maintenance, similar to NetBot. It wouldn't be used very much at all (probably less than NetBot), but I'd like to hear what everybody thinks before I want to use it. | 16:22, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

We should have a Best Article and a Best Picture on our main page. E 18:23, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

Our Esperanza also awards the barnstar to reward other contributors. However, I do realise how this could easily get out of control, and both me and GangstaEB agree that one member organisation and barnstar is enough given our size. I have also been nominated to serve as the admin-general.

<doc id="35735" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35735" title="Sergei Rachmaninoff">
Sergei Rachmaninoff

Sergei Vasilievich Rachmaninoff (Russian: Сергей Васильевич Рахманиновъ) was a famous Russian composer and pianist. He was born on April 1, 1873 (N.S.) and died on March 28, 1943. He was a Russian composer. Because the Russian language uses a different alphabet his name is sometimes spelt in different ways in English (“Sergei” or “Sergey”, and “Rachmaninoff”, “Rachmaninov”, “Rakhmaninov” or “Rakhmaninoff”). "Sergei Rachmaninoff" is the way he spelt his own name when he was in the United States.

He is thought of as one of the greatest pianists of the 20th century. He could play extremely difficult music and had very large hands so that he could play chords with large stretches. As a composer he is thought of as one of the great musicians who composed in the Romantic style, although most of his adult life he lived in the 20th century. His music has wonderful tunes that are easily remembered.

Rachmaninoff was born in Semyonovo, near Novgorod in the north-west of Russia. Members of his family were important people who had been in the service of the tsars of Russia. His parents played the piano and arranged for him to have piano lessons in Saint Petersburg and then Moscow.

While he was still a student he wrote a short opera called "Aleko". He also wrote some piano pieces including a "Prelude in C sharp minor" with loud, heavy chords. This piece became extremely famous and is still his most popular piano piece today. He used to get fed up with people asking him to play the piece.

Not all his music was well-liked at first. The critics thought his "First Symphony" was very bad. This may have been because the orchestra did not play it very well, but it made Rachmaninoff stop composing for a while. After some years of feeling depressed he wrote his "Second Piano Concerto" which everybody liked very much.

Rachmaninoff became happier. He was allowed to marry Natalia after years of engagement during which the Russian Orthodox Church did not want them to be married. The political conditions in Russia were bad so he lived in Germany and Italy for a time. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 he left his country and never returned. He had been very successful with his "Third Piano Concerto" in the United States, so he went to live in the United States in 1918. Russia had become the Soviet Union and for many years Rachmaninoff’s music was not allowed to be performed there. This worried him a lot and he felt homesick. He did not write very much music during the rest of his life in the United States. One work that did become very popular was the "Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini" which he wrote in Switzerland in 1934.

Rachmaninoff’s piano music is mostly difficult to play. He wrote many short pieces called preludes and some studies which are some of the hardest piano music written since Liszt. As well as the "Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini" he wrote four piano concertos. The Second and Third are very popular today, as is his "Second Symphony".

He wrote some very beautiful choral music which includes a piece for choir and orchestra called "The Bells" and a very long, religious work called the "All-Night Vigil" (sometimes called the "Vespers").

He wrote some chamber music including a cello sonata.

There are several excellent recordings of Rachmaninoff playing his own music. Most of these are available now on CD reissues.

Turbot are a large type of flatfish. People want them for their meat. When caught, professional fishermen often make a small cuts through the bone near the tailfin.

Rosa Parks

Rosa Louise McCauley Parks (February 4, 1913 – October 24, 2005) was an African-American seamstress and civil rights activist. She was called the "Mother of the Modern-Day Civil Rights Movement ". She was born in Tuskegee, Alabama on February 4, 1913.

Parks is most famous for what she did on December 1, 1955. While she sat in a seat at the front of a bus, the bus driver told her to move to the back of the bus so a white passenger could take the seat in the front of the bus. Parks refused to move. She was tired of being treated as a lower class person because of the color of her skin. She was arrested. This led to the Montgomery bus boycott. After that, black people could sit wherever they wanted to on the bus. Her refusal to let others treat her differently was an important symbol in the fight for equal rights.

Euler's Identity

Euler's Identity, sometimes called Euler's Equation, is a simple equation that links several important numbers in mathematics in an unexpected way. Euler's identity is named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler.

A reader poll done by Physics World in 2004 called Euler's identity the "greatest equation ever", together with Maxwell's equations. Richard Feynman called Euler's identity "the most beautiful equation". The Identity is well-known for its mathematical beauty: It combines the fields of geometry and algebra, and yet does so using only 7 of the most common and important mathematical symbols.

Euler's Formula is the equation formula_11. Our variable formula_12 can be any real number, but for this proof formula_13. Then formula_14. Since formula_15 and formula_16, the equation can be changed to read formula_17, which gives the identity formula_1.

Hideki Tōjō

Hideki Tōjō (30 December, 1884 – 23 December, 1948) was a leader of Japan during World War 2.

Hideki Tōjō was born on 30 December 1884 in the Kōjimachi district of Tokyo, Japan where he was the third son of a lieutenant general in the Imperial Japanese Army named Hidenori Tōjō. Tōjō had two other brothers that were older than him but they all died before he was born. 

In 1909, he married a woman named Katsuko Ito and he had five children with her: three sons and four daughters.

In the 1930s, Hideki Tōjō fought in the Sino-Japanese war, leading Japanese forces in occupied Manchuria. He returned to Tokyo in 1940 and held ministerial posts, where he urged an alliance with Germany and Italy against the Allied forces. Tojo became Prime Minister in 1941 and within two months ordered a surprise attack on U.S. naval forces in Hawaii. (The subsequent attack on Pearl Harbor was planned by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto.) He shot himself 4 times in the chest, but missed and the bullets hit his stomach, disarmed and with blood gushing out of his chest, Tojo began to talk, his words were "I am very sorry it is taking me so long to die,". Tojo served as the political and military leader of Japan until 1944, when he was demoted by Hirohito. After the war the Allies found Tojo guilty of war crimes and hanged him.

SuSE

SUSE is a main version of a Linux distribution, produced in Germany and owned by Novell, Inc. SUSE is also a founding member of the Desktop Linux Consortium. Starting from version "10.2 Alpha 3" its official name is "openSUSE". The current mascot of SUSE is a chameleon called "Geeko." (The name is a mix of the words geek and gecko.)

The SUSE Linux distribution was originally a German translation of Slackware Linux. The Slackware distribution was founded by Peter MacDonald, and was the first distribution to contain X and TCP/IP. S.u.S.E was founded in 1992 as a UNIX speaking group, which among other things regularly released software packages that included SLS and Slackware, and printed UNIX/Linux manuals. In 1994 the group released the first CD version of SLS/Slackware, under the name "S.u.S.E Linux 1.0." Then in 1996, SuSE Linux gained many aspects from Red Hat Linux. The name "SUSE Linux" came in September 2003.

On November 4, 2003, Novell announced it would buy SuSE. They planned to release the administration program YaST2 under the GPL license and add a community project, openSUSE. The openSUSE desktop environment can be GNOME or KDE. Most parts of the program were "open"--not completely, but more than before. The version "10.0" was the first version that had public beta testing. The philosophy changed from before. There were multiple versions of the "10.0" Linux distribution for download. They are "OSS" (completely open source), with all programs "free" and without proprietary softwares, and "eval" (has both open source and proprietary applications).

The latest release, openSUSE 10.3, is available as two versions. One is without proprietary software such as Adobe Flash. This version can be downloaded freely from the official website. The other version has proprietary software and is not open source. It is available for $59.95 and includes a printed manual and limited technical support.

Worker

A worker is a person who works. This usually means a person who does manual labour, like manufacturing goods. In economics there are three factors of production. These are "labour" (the work done by workers), land (usually people need some space to produce something), and capital (it will cost resources, or money, to produce something).

People who work, usually get paid for the work they do. This is either called wages (if it is bound to a time period, like an hour), or a salary (if it is independent of the time taken).

Guide dog

Guide dogs are dogs trained to help blind people live on their own. They are sometimes called "Seeing Eye" dogs. Guide dogs are one type of assistance animals, which are animals trained to help people with a disability to lead more complete lives.

The blind person (sometimes called a "handler") and the dog need to work together. Both the dog and the handler must take special training to learn how to work as a team. The handler needs to let the guide dog know the direction they want to go. The dog can lead the person around things that may be dangerous, such as moving cars or other things. Also, guide dogs may be taught to press buttons to work elevators or get things for their handler. Because dogs cannot see colors as well as people, they cannot read traffic signals, so the handler must use ways to tell if it is safe to cross a street. 

Because the guide dog and handler will be in public, it is important that the dog stays calm in busy or loud areas. In many countries, guide dogs are allowed inside places where animals normally are not allowed, such as restaurants, stores, buses and trains.

Germany started the first guide dog schools during World War 1, to help soldiers who were blinded in the war. By 1931, schools and organizations such as The Seeing Eye in Morristown, New Jersey in the United States and the British Guide Dog Association in the United Kingdom were founded.

Chocolate cake

A chocolate cake is a cake made with chocolate or cocoa. The ingredients are put into a bowl and mixed together; then the mixed ingredients are put into a cake tin and put in an oven until it is fully cooked. Then the cake is taken out of the oven and placed on a cooling stand. If the cake maker wants to, they can ice the cake, when it has cooled down, by spreading thick icing on it. Chocolate cakes are a sold in shops as well as made at home. They are a sweet food and should not be eaten all the time, which would be unhealthy. They are very good and many enjoy them. There are many different types of chocolate cake, depending on the recipe and different types of chocolate used.

In 1828 Conrad Van Houten of the Netherlands made a mechanical extraction method for taking away the fat from cacao liquor resulting in cacao butter and the mostly de-fatted cacao. It was a compacted mass of solids that could be sold as it was "rock cacao" or ground into powder. The processes made chocolate from an luxury to an cheap daily snack. A process for making smoother chocolate called conching was made in 1879 by Swiss Rodolphe and made it easier to bake with chocolate as it ""amalgamates smoothly and completely with cake batters"." Until 1890 to 1900 chocolate recipes were mostly for drinks.

Imaginary unit

In math, imaginary units, or formula_1, are numbers that can be represented by equations but refer to values that could not physically exist in real life. The mathematical definition of an imaginary unit is formula_2, which has the property formula_3.

The reason formula_1 was created was to answer a polynomial equation, formula_5, which normally has no solution as the value of x^2 would have to equal -1. Though the problem is solvable, the square root of -1 could not be represented by a physical quantity of any objects in real life.

It is sometimes assumed that one must create another number to show the square root of formula_1, but that is not needed. The square root of formula_1 can be written as: formula_8. This can be shown as:

The powers of formula_1 follow a predictable pattern:

This can be shown with the following pattern where "n" is any integer:

Phycology (or algology), a part of botany, is the study of algae. Algae are important as plants in aquatic ecosystems. Most algae are eukaryotic, photosynthetic organisms that live in a wet environment. They are different from the higher plants by a lack of "normal" roots, stems or leaves. Many types have one cell and are very small or microscopic (including plankton and other algae); many others are have many cells, some of these being very big, like seaweeds such as kelp and "Sargassum".

Phycology is also the study of prokaryotic forms known as blue-green algae or cyanobacteria. Some microscopic algae are also in Lichens.

Grave was the word that was used to describe mass before the word "kilogram" was introduced. "Grave" comes from the word "gravity" and was first used in 1793 in France. The name "kilogram" was introduced in 1795 but was not the official word for mass until 1875.

In order to have full consistency in the International System of Units (SI), many people think that the kilogram should be called something different. Using the word "kilogram" creates a problem because it is a base unit that has the prefix "kilo" already in its name. To fix the problem, some people have suggested using the word "grave" again.

Allotheria is an exinct subclass or superorder of mammals. It is a relative of the prototheria and theria.

The allotheres was a branch of successful Mesozoic mammals. The most important characteristic was the presence of lower molariform teeth equipped with two longitudinal rows of cusps.

Allotheres also had a narrow pelvis, indicating that they gave birth to tiny helpless young like marsupials do.

Multituberculata

The Multituberculata were a group of rodent-like mammals that existed for approximately 120 million years – the longest fossil history of any mammal lineage. 

They were eventually outcompeted by rodents, becoming extinct during the early Oligocene. 

At least 200 species are known, ranging from mouse-sized to beaver-sized. These species occupied many ecological niches, ranging from burrow-dwelling to squirrel-like tree-dwelling. 

Multituberculates are usually placed outside both the two main groups of living mammals, the Theria (placentals and marsupials), and monotremes. Some cladistic analyses put them closer to Theria than to monotremes.

The multituberculates had a head anatomy similar to rodents. They had cheek-teeth separated from the chisel-like front teeth by a wide tooth-less gap (called the "diastema"). Each cheek-tooth displayed several rows of small cusps (or tubercles, hence the name) which worked against similar rows in the teeth of the jaw. It was an efficient chopping device.

Most small multituberculates would have eaten seeds and nuts, supplemented with insects, worms, and fruit.

The structure of the pelvis in the Multituberculata suggests that they gave birth to tiny helpless young, similar to modern marsupials.

South Tarawa (in Gilbertese and English: Teinainano Urban Council or abr. TUC) is the capital city of the country Kiribati. It is on an island called Tarawa Atoll. The meaning of Teinainano is "down of the mast", referring to the sail-shape of the atoll.

The South Tarawa population center is made up of all the small islands between Bairiki (on the west) to Temaiku on the east. All of separated islands are joined by causeways, forming one long island on the reef along the southern side of the Tarawa Lagoon. There is also a new causeway—the Japanese Causeway—that links South Tarawa to Betio. South Tarawa is located at 1°19' North, 172°58' East (1.31667, 172.9667). 

There is a Kiribati Teacher College and one University of the South Pacific center on South Tarawa. Bairiki is sometimes considered "the" capital of Kiribati because at one time both the Parliament, the Presidency and main administrative offices were located there. The Parliament meets on Ambo island; Government department are spread among South Tarawa, Betio and Christmas Island.

The Roman Catholic diocese and the Kiribati Protestant Church are located on South Tarawa. Bairiki (executive), Ambo (legislative), Betio (judicial) are the main places of the capital.

A recording engineer (or simply "engineer" for short) is a person who operates, and usually chooses and sets up recording equipment. The term applies mainly to a person who works in a , but can also apply to people who do the same kind of work, in other places. An engineer may work with , stereophonic or remixes, or both.

Some amateur (and a few professional) engineers are self-taught, and learn mostly by doing, or with the help of a manual or . Many engineers started in other studio jobs (such as or ), and learned about recording as they became familiar with the studio where they worked. An engineer learns about the use and placement of microphones, how to operate and maintain a , , and other machines, and how to live and recorded sounds, to make the best, and often the most unique, recording possible. A good engineer will strive to make recordings that are both of high technical quality, and also pleasing to hear.

Starting wages may be small in recording studios, and many work as unpaid volunteers. Experienced engineers, especially those who have worked on a , may command a large wage. Some engineers are paid a salary, while others may earn hourly pay (sometimes based on the studio's rates), or be paid per session. Many go on to start their own recording studios, or maintain a private studio or service. A few work only for a single , band, or producer.

Several colleges and universities in the United States and other countries offer classes in recording, which may cover its history, its uses, and of course technique and technical knowledge. Some schools offer degree or diploma programs in Recording. Graduating such a program does not guarantee a person a studio job, but increases one's chances, and can provide better preparation for such a career.

Besides studio work, some engineers have one or more specialties, such as of old recordings, as to places that give concerts and live performances, and sometimes as in court trials, when sounds or a recording may be important to the outcome of a case.

<doc id="35987" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35987" title="Phil Spector">
Phil Spector

Harvey Phillip Spector (born December 26, 1940 in the Bronx, New York) is an American musician (piano, guitar), songwriter and record producer. He is most famous as a producer. He was co-owner of Philles Records (with then-business partner Lester Sill), and later owner of Phil Spector Records. In 2009 he was found guilty of second degree murder.

Spector's signature style was called the Wall of Sound. He used large amounts of echo, doubling and multiplying of musical instruments and the parts to be played, and of recorded parts. The built-up effect gave his records an operatic, theatrical quality. The music sounded "bigger than life". The effect carried over especially well on AM radio, which was how most music was broadcast in the 1950s and 1960s. Spector said the Wall of Sound made "...little symphonies for kids...".

The recording artists who worked with Spector over the years included The Crystals ("Then He Kissed Me"), The Ronettes ("Be My Baby"), The Righteous Brothers ("You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'", Gene Pitney ("Every Breath I Take"), Darlene Love ("(Today I Met) The Boy I'm Gonna Marry"), and Tina Turner ("River Deep, Mountain High"). Sonny Bono and Cher were among his backup singers. He married Veronica (Ronnie) Bennett of the Ronettes, who took the name Ronnie Spector.

Spector's strongest work was in creating hit singles. He knew many fans never listened to the B-sides of singles, and radio seldom played them, so often his B-sides would feature an instrumental jam session, without the singers credited on the record, and with titles like "Flip and Nitty". Spector also disliked albums. He called them "two hit (song)s, and ten pieces of junk". When stereo became more popular than mono in recording, Spector did not follow the trend. In later years he wore a red badge in public, with the words BACK TO MONO.

Many other producers and musicians imitated the Wall of Sound style, or included elements of it in their own work, including Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys. Wilson thought of Spector as his biggest rival, although the two did work together on one song, that was used in a .

Not all of Spector's productions became hits. One record, "He Hit Me (And It Felt Like A Kiss)" was pulled from release after complaints were made by listeners, about the song's theme. (The song was later performed by singer Courtney Love.) Another record, "This Could Be The Night" (working with both Harry Nilsson and Chip Douglas), went unreleased, although radio Rodney Bingenheimer used it later as his show's . "(Let's Dance) The Screw" was a private to Lester Sill, when his partnership with Spector ended badly, and only a few copies were pressed. "River Deep, Mountain High", which Spector thought of as his all-time best work, drew little attention in the United States, but it was a hit in other countries.

One of the few full albums Spector produced, "A Christmas Gift to You", was released in 1963. The album featured nearly all of the artists Spector worked with regularly. The album did not become a hit at first, but it went on to become a Christmas perennial. Many music listeners consider the album a .

The Beatles handed over the rough tapes of their unfinished "Get Back" album for Spector to post-produce, after John Lennon and George Harrison both worked successfully with him on "Instant Karma!'", which became a hit single for Lennon. "Let it Be" was the title for the finished album (and movie, filmed during the recording sessions). Beatles fans bought and enjoyed the album and its singles, but some fans and experts disliked portions of Spector's work. Paul McCartney hated the changes Spector made to "The Long and Winding Road", which he meant to have a simple accompaniment, but was released with a choir and orchestra added. McCartney never recorded with Spector, but the other three Beatles worked with him several times, on solo recordings.

Spector appeared as an actor a few times. One appearance was in an episode of "I Dream of Jeannie", as a music producer. Another was in the movie "Easy Rider", as a rich man who buys cocaine from the two main characters. A character in a 1970 movie, "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls", was based on the way many people saw Spector. He appeared as himself in scenes from "Imagine", a 1973 film about the recording of John Lennon's 1971 album of the same name.

Spector worked less often in the 1970s and 1980s, and his most notable work from those years was with The Ramones and Yoko Ono, the widow of John Lennon. Spector and Ronnie were divorced, and she sued him years later for unpaid royalties from her years as a singer. She collected over a million dollars, after many years of going to court. Spector spent much of his time as a "retired celebrity", staying home at his Alhambra, California or dining out. He sometimes invited women guests home, after a night out drinking alcohol. Some of the women reported later having a pleasant time with Spector. Others told stories of being abused, , or threatened with a gun.

In February 2003, police were called to Spector's home to investigate a shooting. Actress Lana Clarkson was found dead on the grounds. Spector was charged with second-degree murder. He admitted possible guilt or involvement in Clarkson's death privately, but decided to plead not guilty in court. Attorney Robert Shapiro was hired to defend him, but Bruce Cutler, and later Linda Kenney-Baden, took over the job. Spector's case went to trial in the spring of 2007, and ended in a that Autumn. Spector was tried again in 2009 and found guilty of second degree murder.

Fugue

A fugue is a piece of music written for a certain number of parts (voices). The word “fugue“ comes from the Italian “fuga“ meaning “flight“.

A fugue is based on one particular tune. This tune is called the subject. Each part has an equal share in playing the subject. When we talk about the “parts” in a fugue we do not mean the “sections” of the piece but the number of voices needed to sing it or instruments to play it. A “3 part fugue” means a fugue written for three voices or instruments. If it is for the piano there will always be three, and no more than three, notes being played, unless one or two of the voices have rests at that moment.

Fugues can be in 2, 3, 4, 5 or even 6 parts. The more parts there are the harder it is to write a fugue because each part has to sound interesting by itself, but together they must also make sense. 3, 4 and 5 part fugues are usual.

A fugue always starts with just one part playing the subject. Then the other parts come in one at a time until they are all playing. When the second part comes in it will always be half an octave higher or lower than the beginning (musicians say: “on the dominant”, meaning that it starts on the 5th note of the scale instead of the “tonic” or 1st note). This called: the answer. The third part to come in will be the “subject” (in the tonic once again) and the fourth part will be another answer, etc.

If the answer is an exact transposition of the subject (i.e. exactly the same but in the dominant key) it is called a real answer. Sometimes one or two notes have to be changed so that the music sounds right. This is called a tonal answer. For example: a subject that starts with a rising “doh – soh” (an interval of a fifth) will be answered by a rising “soh – doh” in the answer (an interval of a fourth).

When the second part comes in with the answer the first part will have to play something else, called a countersubject. If this “something else” is used every time in the piece to accompany the answer then it is called a regular countersubject. The countersubject should sound nice, and be grammatically correct, whether it is on top or below the subject. This is called “invertible counterpoint”.

If a part is not playing a countersubject it may just be playing a “free part”.

A redundant entry is the repetition of the subject or answer in a voice in which one or two of the aforementioned have already been stated.

Sometimes entries overlap. This is called stretto (NB “stretto” also has a different meaning in music: “hurried”).

If none of the parts are playing the subject or answer (i.e. they are all playing free parts) this is called an episode. If it happens during the first section (exposition) then it is called a codetta.

Because a fugue is a piece which puts several lines of melody together it is a form of contrapuntal music.

A fugue usually has three sections: the first section is called the “exposition”. This lasts until all the parts have entered. The middle section will go through various keys (modulate), and the final section will be back in the main key (tonic), and all the parts will probably play the subject or answer in turn once more.

The fugue became a very popular form of music in the Baroque period. It was often played after a prelude. The most famous composer of fugues was Johann Sebastian Bach. He wrote two books, each with 24 Preludes and Fugues, called the “Das Wohltemperiertes Klavier” (Well-tempered keyboard). He also wrote many Preludes and Fugues for organ, sometimes writing a passacaglia, fantasia or toccata instead of the prelude. Bach’s fugues became models for future generations. Composers from later periods all studied Bach’s fugues in order to learn how to write them. 

Fugues can be very dramatic and exciting as each part comes in one at a time and the music builds up. This is why many composers have ended long works with a fugue. It helps to build up the tension towards the end of the work. Even if it is not a strict fugue it might be “fugal” i.e. it might start off as a fugue and then become freer (adding extra parts etc). Beethoven uses fugues a lot in the last movement of his late piano sonatas. Benjamin Britten writes a fugue at the end of A Young Person’s Guide to the Orchestra. At the end of his song for choir called “The Twelve” William Walton starts a fugue with a very long, fast and complicated fugues subject, but it soon develops into a much freer piece of music.

Recording artist

A recording artist is a singer or musician who is known for making musical recordings. 

Many recording artists are also stage performers, but a few work only in a . This may be because they dislike touring or giving live appearances, or because they prefer studio work or need to stay close to home.

Recording artists are usually paid from sales of their recordings. They will get a percentage of the money their record label receives when people buy their recordings. This percentage may be as low as 1/2%, though rates can become much higher. Some artists are only paid for session work, or by the number of recordings they make.

The Beatles remain the world's most successful recording artists, nearly forty years since they broke up in 1970. Their record sales are well over one billion. Elvis Presley is the world's most successful solo recording artist, with worldwide sales of over 1 billion records according to the 2012 "Guinness Book of World Records".

Other artists who have achieved sales records or include The Eagles (whose "Greatest Hits" album became the world's biggest-selling record in the 1990s), Bing Crosby (whose "White Christmas" sold the most copies of any single, until Elton John's "Candle in the Wind" outsold it in the late 1990s), and Pink Floyd (their "Dark Side of the Moon" stayed on the "Billboard" sales charts for more than ten years).

Groundhog

The Groundhog is a rodent. It belongs to the group of ground squirrels. Those squirrels are also known as marmots. The animal may also be called Woodchuck, or Whistlepig. Groundhogs are subteranean (Sub-tar-ae-nee-an) creatures, which means they dig tunnels and live underground. Groundhog holes, called burrows, are easy to recognize; they are holes, about 9.in (inches) (23 cm (centimeters)) wide which usually have large piles of dirt and rocks at the entrance. Every single hole, may have tunnels which lead to as many as ten other holes, the tunnels are very large and can have chambers, like rooms, in them. Groundhogs can make their homes under trees, around buildings and in open fields. 

Some problems with groundhogs are that they eat crops and dig around the foundations of buildings. When groundhogs dig around buildings this can cause damage if the holes go too far under the building.
Ground hogs first came from South America.

In the United States, there is a holiday called Groundhog Day. It is celebrated on February 2 of every year.

Squirrel

Squirrels are a family of rodents that includes marmots and chipmunks. Most squirrels are omnivores; they eat anything they find. Many kinds of squirrels live in trees, so they often find nuts. Despite living in trees squirrels are considered flightless because they can only jump short distances. They eat seeds, berries and pine cones too. Sometimes they eat bird's eggs and insects. Most tree squirrels store food in the fall, to eat in the winter. Ground squirrels do not store food. They hibernate which means they spend winter in a deep sleep. Squirrels are well known in Eurasia and North America. The most common European squirrels are red or brown in color, while common American squirrels are usually grey or black. Grey squirrels have been introduced into Europe (most notably, Great Britain). Grey squirrels cause problems to the red squirrel's population there. Red squirrels are protected in most of Europe. Squirrels have many predators or enemies. Foxes and raccoons eat squirrels. Hawks and owls also eat squirrels. 
Squirrels have sex in February and March in winter, and in June and July in summer. Females may become pregnant up to twice a year. Usually 4-6 young are born, after a gestation period (pregnancy) of around 39 days. Only the mother looks after the young, which are born completely helpless. Young squirrels are deaf and blind during the first few weeks of their life. In the wild, squirrels get about 3 years old. They usually become mature after two. In captivity, squirrels were observed to live for up to 10 years.

Gestation

Gestation is the carrying of an embryo or fetus inside a female viviparous animal, until its birth. 
In mammals, there is the possibility that one female can have multiple gestations at the same time. Such births are usually called twins. The time the female spends till the birth of the young is usually called gestation period. Humans have a gestation period of around 37 weeks or about 9 months and 1 week. 

Syrian hamsters are believed to have the shortest gestation period which is just 16 days.

Marmots are small mammals, that form the genus Marmota.

They are rodents that belong to the group of ground squirrels. Most of them live in the mountains, like the Sierra Nevada, or the Alps. Marmots make holes in the ground. They live in burrows, underground. They hibernate, that is they sleep through the winter. Marmots are very social animals. They group together easily. They also like to communicate with each other, with whistles, especially when they sense danger.

Many historians suggest that marmots, rather than rats, were the carriers of bubonic plague epidemics in the Middle Ages.

Human Be-In

The 'Human Be-In' was an event during the afternoon and evening of January 14, 1967. It was held in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. The Human Be-In led the way to the Summer of Love, which introduced hippie life and the word psychedelic to everyday Americans, and made the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco famous as the center of an American counterculture.

The hippie movement had two main sources. One source was college students who were not happy about the way the country was headed. They did not like the way African Americans were being treated in the south or the way young men were being drafted to fight in the Vietnam War. The other source of the hippie movement was the 'Beat Generation' (poets and jazz hipsters). 

Throughout the early 1960s, college students who were against the policies of segregation in Southern United States would travel to the south. They would take part in sit-ins, register African Americans to vote, demonstrate, march, and other activism. More and more people were unhappy about the Vietnam War and the riots. During this time, San Francisco was becoming a center for younger people who liked to experiment with drugs, and it was also a center for the music scene. From the idea of the 'sit-in', they got the idea to have a 'Human Be-In' in early January to get people's minds off politics and the war. 

The Human Be-In was announced on the cover of the first issue of the "San Francisco Oracle" as "A Gathering of the Tribes for a Human Be-In". Speakers at the rally included Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert (soon to be more widely known as 'Ram Dass'), and poets like Allen Ginsberg, who chanted mantras, and Gary Snyder. Leary set the tone that afternoon with his famous phrase "Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out". Other counterculture leaders who were there included comedian Dick Gregory, Lenore Kandel, and Jerry Rubin. The Hells Angels, at the peak of their 'outlaw' reputation, looked after lost children. Local rock bands such as Grateful Dead and Quicksilver Messenger Service provided the music, and Owsley "Bear" Stanley provided massive amounts of his "White Lightning" LSD to the gathered masses. 

The national media did not know what to say. No one was able to agree whether 20,000 or 30,000 people showed up. Soon every gathering was being called an '-In' of some kind. "Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In", a television comedy series, began to appear on NBC just a year later, January 22, 1968. 

During 1967, more and more young people from around the country began traveling to San Francisco. By the summer there were between 100,000 to 200,000 there taking part in the "Summer of Love".

Tainan City is a city in Taiwan. It is the fourth largest city after Taipei, Kaohsiung and Taichung.

Tainan was the capital of Taiwan in 1661 when Koxinga took the island from Dutch colonial rule. In 1684, the Qing Dynasty conquered Taiwan and created "Taiwan Fu" (the first local government in Taiwan). This was later renamed to "Tainan Fu" in 1885. Because it was the capital of Taiwan, Tainan is also called Fu-cheng (Government City). Tainan was also the capital of the Republic of Formosa.

Tainan is one of the oldest cities in Taiwan, with the Dutch port at An-ping (安平) in 1624. It is also one of Taiwan's cultural capitals, as it built the First Confucian School/Temple on the island. There are remains of the Northern and Southern gates of the old city, and other old monuments. 

Tainan is the city with the most Buddhist and/or Taoist temples on Taiwan. Tainan City is surrounded by Tainan County to the north and east and the South China Sea to the west and south.

Tainan City now has six districts: Anping, Annan, East, West Central, South, and North districts.

Annan district was originally the An-Shun township of Tainan County, and was added into Tainan City in 1946.

An example (Latin "exemplum", the shorthand "e.g". stands for "exempli gratia", which means "for example") is a short story, or an anecdote. This story is told to illustrate something else, like an idea or a concept.

In the Middle Ages, preachers and priests used examples in their sermons. They did this to explain things from the bible. They also did this to explain to all those people (that were incapable of reading) how they should lead their lives, as a good person.

Examples help illustrate a point. 

The phrase "make an example" is sometimes used, when a person is harshly punished for others to see. This is done to keep other people (especially the person's peers) from doing the same thing that got that person into trouble.

Kangaroo rat

Kangaroo rats are small rodents from North and Central America. They got their name, because they look like small kangaroos, when standing upright. But they are not related to kangaroos, except that they are mammals. The genus of the kangaroo rats is called Dipodomys.

Currently, there are 22 species in that genus. They vary in size from 10cm to 20cm, and weight between 35 and 180 grams for adult animals.

Kangaroo rats live in dry climates.They can live in deserts also, like Thar Desert. This means that they have developed traits to other species that live in such climates, but are not related to them. Some of those species are the jerboas, which can be found in the deserts of Africa and Asia, and the hopping mice of the Australian Outback. 

All of those species have highly developed hind legs. They also live in deep burrows that protect them from the worst heat of the day. Water may be difficult to find in such climates. Therefore, they only rarely need to drink water. Instead, they have a very efficient metabolism. Their kidneys are much more efficient than human kidneys. They can also chemically split off water from the food they eat. 

Kangaroo mice are found in areas if the United States and Mexico, where there is some grass or vegetation left, but which have a rather dry climate. Scientists call those areas arid and semi-arid. The animals live on seeds, leaves, nuts and other fruit they can find. They also catch insects. They are also known for stockpiling (keeping) some food in their burrows, for bad times. 

Usually the animals have a color that blends in nicely with the sandy surroundings. Most often they are a tone of dark yellow to deep brown.

They are nocturnal which means that it is active during the night.

Hibernation is a time of inactivity. Some animals hibernate, usually during the winter, when food is short. They fall into a sleep-like state. They can regulate their metabolism to consume less energy. They lower their body temperature, slow their breathing, and slow other vital functions. During hibernation, the body uses fat for energy, which the animal has typically gathered in summer and autumn. 

Typical animals that hibernate are bats, ground squirrels (like marmots), hedgehogs, and marsupials.

Many see it as a pest to cereal crops, and gardens in India and Sri Lanka. When attacking the rat grunts like a pig. Their fur is dark brown on the back (dorsally, as scientists say), and usually lighter or darker grey on the belly-side (ventrally). The length of their body is about 25cm, and the tail is shorter than the body.

Sometimes, the rats live in empty houses in villages. When they feel threatened, they are very aggressive. Many also see them as a threat to infants (babies). Packs of Lesser Bandicoot rats have been known to attack and devour infants left alone. 

Despite its name, the rat is not related to the Bandicoot.

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature says there are large numbers of Lesser Bandicoot rats found over a wide area. They have listed them as being of Least Concern for survival into the future.

Roquefort cheese is a kind of blue cheese which comes from the south of France. It is made from sheep's milk. French laws about AOC say that only cheese from the region of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon (close to Millau) may be called Roquefort cheese. 

This cheese breaks into little pieces easily, and it is a little moist. Blue mould is added to Roquefort cheese, which gives it a particular taste. Roquefort is produced in big wheels which weigh around 2.5 kilograms, and which are about 10 cm thick. Roquefort needs to ripen around 5 months. It is best consumed April to October, but of course it is available year round. 

In the year 2003, there were seven Roquefort producers. The largest by far is Roquefort Société. Roquefort Papillon is also a well-known brand. The five other producers are Carles, Gabriel Coulet, Fromageries occitanes, Vernières and Le Vieux Berger.

Another cheese, which is similar, but made from the milk of cows, is Gorgonzola.

Serial ATA

Serial ATA (SATA or Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) is a way of connecting a hard drive to a computer. 

It is a replacement for what is now called PATA. PATA used to be called ATA or IDE, before SATA was introduced.

SATA's most important difference from PATA is that it uses a thinner cable to connect the hard drive to the computer. 

PATA is still used more often than SATA, but it is being replaced in newer computers. Most computers made since 2005 already have SATA interfaces. The P in PATA stands for "parallel", and is seen in the many wires running in the same direction, in the ribbon cable it uses to connect the hard drive. 

There are many differences between Serial ATA and Parallel ATA. In theory, SATA is faster than PATA. However, the top speeds (1.50Gb/s, 3.00 Gb/s, 6.00Gb/s) that companies advertise do not happen very often. Other benefits are the much easier handling of the new cable type. Some drives can also be connected and disconnected while the computer is running. This is called hot swapping. Finally, some drives support a technology called "Native Command Queueing". This means that the drive can rearrange the order of what it's told to do so that it gets done faster.

The two also have different connections and different motherboard types.

Flag of Estonia

The flag of Estonia has three colours and is made of three equal horizontal bands coloured blue (top), black, and white (bottom). Blue mirrors the sky, black the colour of the soil and national coat, and white the peoples' happiness and light. In Estonian language it is called the "sinimustvalge" (literally "blue-black-white"), after the colours of the bands. The flag was designed in the 1880s and adopted when Estonia became independent in 1918.

Coat of Arms of Estonia

The coat of arms of Estonia is a golden shield which includes three slim, blue "leopard"s (or lions passant guardant) in the middle, with oak branches along the side of the shield.

The coat of arms of Estonia has existed long before they were official recognized after the War of Independence 1918 - 1920, when the Republic of Estonia was internationally recognized.

The symbol has been in use since the 13th century, where the big coat of arms was used for the capital city, Tallinn. The origin of the slim blue lions can be traced back to the King of Denmark at the time, Valdemar the Second. As Denmark was the ruling power of Northern Estonia at the time, it imposed the coat of arms upon the state.

Apatosaurus

Apatosaurus was a sauropod dinosaur which lived in the late Jurassic period. It was known before as "Brontosaurus". 

It grew as big as 21 meters long, 4.5 meters tall at the hip, and weighed up to 23 metric tons. It ate plants. The bones of "Apatosaurus" have been found in Wyoming, Colorado, Oklahoma, and Utah in the United States.

When it was first found, scientists thought that "Apatosaurus" lived partly under water, since it could not hold its own weight on dry land. Now they think it lived on dry land, probably in herds.

The cervical vertebrae were less elongated and more solid than those of "Diplodocus". The bones of the leg were much stockier (despite being longer), implying a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. Like most sauropods, "Apatosaurus" had only a single large claw on each forelimb, with the first three toes on the hind limb possessing claws.

There are three species of "Apatosaurus":

Brontosaurus (meaning "thunder lizard") was a dinosaur which is now considered to be "Apatosaurus". Othniel Charles Marsh described it as a new type of dinosaur. 

The "Brontosaurus" became exceedingly popular, and the name "Brontosaurus" is often applied to the "Apatosaurus". Some argued it should be called "Apatosaurus" as early as 1903, while others at the same time felt that the name "Brontosaurus" should be a synonym for "Apatosaurus". Most agreed with this by the 1970s, but some books still use the old name.

Trojan horse (computing)

A trojan horse (Sometimes called a trojan) is a special computer program. Trojan horses are programs that pretend to do a certain thing, but in reality they do something else, such as allow a stranger to access the computer and change it and read its information. In some cases the user notices, in other cases they do not. Spyware programs are current examples of programs that work in that way.

It is rare to get a trojan on your computer by merely visiting a website, though it can happen. Usually, though, a trojan is attached to something you download. Usually they attach themselves to music, wallpapers, backgrounds, games, and especially executable files (.exe) so on. 

It was named after the Trojan Horse in Greek mythology.

Barbecue (or "Barbecue", "BBQ") is a special type of grill. It is also a way to prepare meat which is then cooked with that instrument. It is especially popular in Australia and in certain parts of the United States.

People in the United States barbecue chicken, beef and pork, depending on the part of the country. Barbecuing is very big in the Central and Southern U.S., especially in Texas with beef and Kansas City with pork. In the United States barbecued meat is usually covered in barbecue sauce, a type of thick, dark red sauce that often contains spices, tomatoes, and honey. Very often, American barbecue grills get heat from hickory wood.

In California, it was common to barbecue beef in a hole in the ground rather than a grill. This is called a "pit barbecue"

Legacy

In historical terms, a legacy is something that is handed down from one period of time to another period of time. A historical legacy can be a positive thing or a negative thing. For example, the invention of the wheel (for carts, as a pottery wheel, as a grinding wheel to help turn grain into flour, and as an early water wheel) in Mesopotamia can be seen as something positive. The development of slavery is a negative legacy.
Sometimes countries or civilizations can leave a legacy. In Athens, in Ancient Greece, people voted on their leaders. They created an early form of democracy. Greece, and later, Ancient Rome voted for their leaders for many generations.
Some families pass objects and ideas down from generation to generation. These objects and ideas can also be called legacies. It may have to do with a person or many people. Individuals can leave a historical legacy. More than 2000 years ago the Greek Mathematician, Euclid of Alexandria, collected and wrote down ideas about geometry and measurement in a text called "Elements". Students still use these ideas when they learn about mathematics.
Legacies are, more or less, what we remember about a person or a country. What an individual or a country does today might, in the future, be regarded as being important enough to be thought of as a legacy from the 21st Century.

Common Era

Common Era is the calendar system commonly used in the Western world to number the year part of a date. The year numbers are the same as those used for "Anno Domini" (AD); in both systems the current year is 2017, and neither system uses a year zero. Common Era is abbreviated as CE, and is also known as Current Era and Christian Era. BCE is used as the abbreviation to indicate years Before the Common Era, which uses the same numbering as BC or Before Christ. CE and BCE are placed after the year number (as is BC; AD is traditionally placed before the year number, but some modern style guides accept placement after). 

The year-numbering used in the Gregorian calendar is based on a sixth century estimate for the year Jesus was born. The use of "Anno Domini" (Latin for "in year of the/our Lord") has been used with the Western calendar since about that time. The use of "Before Christ" and the abbreviations AD and BC came somewhat later. The Gregorian calendar is an internationally recognized standard and has become the most widely-used calendar in the world, used by both Christians and non-Christians. Use of "Common Era" notation (CE/BCE) does not make use of religious titles ("Lord" and " Christ") for Jesus that are part of in the AD/BC notation. Usage of Common Era notation began about 1615 among Christians in Europe, and has been growing among non-Christians and among Christians who desire to be sensitive to non-Christians. 

Many faiths and countries have their own calendars, in which the year, the month, and the day may differ from the designation on the Gregorian calendar. For example, Muslim countries use the Islamic calendar which counts years since the first Hijra (when the prophet Muhammad went from Mecca to Medina). Late in 2017 CE, the year 1439 AH using the Islamic calendar will begin. On the Hebrew calendar, a new year coincides with a day from September 5 to October 5, with the year 5778 beginning in 2017. Writing dates as "Common Era" makes it possible for non-Christian people and cultures to adopt the Gregorian calendar in common, without attaching an expression of faith in Jesus.

<doc id="36351" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36351" title="Sheet music">
Sheet music

The music that musicians have in front of them when they play is printed music. The sheet or sheets of paper that contain(s) the written notation of what the musician are to play is called printed music.

Sheet music is a subset of printed music. Sheet music usually refers to a "single sheet" of music; that is, one song or piece printed separately. Printed music includes sheet music but also includes music published in collections. People often confuse sheet music with printed music. 

Usually people just say “music” if it is obvious that they are talking about printed music:

"George went to his piano lesson. When he opened his music bag he saw that he had forgotten to put his music in it".

Most other European languages use the word for “note” in this meaning, but in English the “notes” are the actual little dots on the paper which stand for the sounds:

"George was playing from the music, but it was hard to read because some of the notes were badly printed".

The printed music can be used to make it clear that it is printed music; not recorded music:

"The music shop sold CDs and printed music".

music can be published as a separate copy ("single sheet music")for one piece or song, or it can be a collection of pieces in a larger book.

If, for example, there is a piece of music for violin and piano, then the pianist will play from the piano part, which will have the piano music written, as usual, on two staves. Above those two staves, printed slightly smaller, will be another stave with the violin part. The violinist will play from a separate part which will just have the violin music. This means that the pianist can always see what the violin should be playing, but not the violinist will not be able to see what the pianist is playing. The violinist may need to look at the piano part sometimes to see how the violin and piano part fit together. It would be difficult for the violinist to play from music with both parts because he would need to turn the pages too often. (Unless the violinist had a few measures of rest right before the page turn, the violinist would miss playing some of his/her part while turning the page.)

A score is printed music of a piece written for several instruments. The music (parts) for each instrument are written above one another on separate staves. A conductor can see from the score what each instrument should be playing and how it fits together. Each player only has his or her own part (the notes that that performer plays) in front of him/her. From time to time, if the instrument has long period where he/she does not play (that is, has a block of rests), the publisher may print, usually in smaller type, a portion of the music another instruments (usually an instrument playing the melody) would be playing to help the performer know what to listen before he/she starts playing. These smaller notes are called cues because it cues, or clues, the performer that he/she is going to start playing soon.)

An orchestral score or full score shows exactly what all the instruments of the orchestra play. If the piece uses a large orchestra with many different instruments, the page must be very tall. The conductor uses the score to be able to see which instruments are playing when. The conductor would cue orchestra members (or sections within the orchestra) when they begin to play. Conductors do much more than this (tempo, dynamics, interpretation, etc.), of course, but most conductors use a score when rehearsing the orchestra or when the orchestra is performing.

A miniature score, "study score," or pocket score is like an orchestral score but much smaller. It will not be big enough for a conductor to conduct from because the print will be too small, but it will be good enough for studying, and it will be much cheaper than a large, orchestral score.

In an orchestral score the order in which the instrumental lines are printed will be: woodwind at the top (flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon and any other special woodwind), brass (trumpet, trombone, tuba, French horn), percussion and strings (violin, viola, cello and double bass). If there is a choir or solo singers their part is written near the bottom, above the cello stave. The bar lines will usually join up the staves of each family. This makes it easier to find the instruments than if they had been drawn all the way down the page.

A vocal score or piano score is the music for a piece for choir and singers (e.g. an opera) in which all the instrumental parts are printed on two staves so that it can be played on a piano. Some notes will, of course, have to be left out to make it possible to play with just two hands.

A short score means a score where an orchestral piece has been written on three or four staves only. It is something between a piano score and a full score. A composer may write a piece in short score when composing it, and write out an orchestral score later. Short scores are not usually published, they are just working copies while the piece is being composed.

The United States claimed Funafuti until a treaty of friendship was concluded in the late 70's or early 80's.

The largest island is Fongafale. On this island, there are four villages, of which one is Vaiaku, where the government is. The capital of Tuvalu is sometimes given as Fongafale or Vaiaku, but the entire atoll of Funafuti is actually the capital.

There are at least 33 islands in the atoll. The biggest is Fongafale, followed by Funafala. At least three islands are inhabited, which are Fongafale, Funafala and Motuloa.

<doc id="36457" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36457" title="Red blood cell">
Red blood cell

Red blood cells (also known as RBCs, red blood corpuscles or erythrocytes) are cells in the blood which transport oxygen. Red blood cells are very large in number; in women, there are 4.8 million red blood cells per microliter of blood. In men, there are 5.4 million red blood cells per microliter of blood. Red blood cells are red because they have hemoglobin in them. 

The most important function of red blood cells is the transport of oxygen. The hemoglobin absorbs oxygen in the lungs, travels through blood vessels and brings oxygen to all other cells via the heart. A fact which makes human red blood cells different to all other cells is that red blood cells do not have a nucleus, since they need lots of room for hemoglobin. However, bird red blood cells have nucleus. Since the blood cells go through both the lungs (to collect oxygen), through the heart (to be pumped around the rest of the body to give all cells oxygen) and back to the heart to be re-pumped to the lungs (to again collect oxygen), it is said that the blood in your body travels in a double circuit, going through your heart twice before it completes one full of the body.

Red blood cells are doughnut (without the hole) shaped. However, hereditary diseases such as sickle-cell disease can cause them to change shapes and stop blood flow in capillaries and veins. Red blood cells do not have some parts that normal cells have, such as the nucleus, which makes the doughnut shape we see. Plasma is obtained from whole blood. To prevent clotting, an anticoagulant such as citrate is added to the blood specimen immediately after it is obtained.

Like all cells in the body, red blood cells begin as a stem cell. This is called a hematopoietic stem cell. This cell can form lots of cell types that make up the blood. The red cell is only one of the possibilities. Although red cells are small cells, they are very big when they are young cells. Just like people, cells must mature. Blood cells get smaller as they get older. When they grow, they have to cut themselves in half to reproduce. They start off with a nucleus and are called "erythroblasts". A "blast" is a baby cell. Erythroblasts are much bigger than red blood cells. These become polychromatophilic red blood cells. They are named that because they are seen with many colors when stained. After this, they eject their nucleus and change shape to become a red blood cell.

Chişinău

Chişinău (IPA /ki.ʃi.'nəu/), formerly known as Kishinev, is the capital city and industrial and commercial center of the Moldova. It is also largest city of Moldova. It is located in the center of the country, on the river Bîc. 

Politically the city lies in the middle of the central area of Moldova and is divided into five administrative districts. These are:


Chişinău was founded in 1436 as a monastery town, the city was part of the Moldavian Principality, which, starting with the 16th century fell under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire. At the beginning of the 19th century it was a small village of 7,000 inhabitants. In 1812 it was occupied by Russia, who made it the centre of Bessarabia. Its population had grown to 92,000 by 1862 and to 125,787 by 1900. 

Following the Russian October Revolution the country declared independence from the fallen empire, before joining the Kingdom of Romania. With Moldova only autonomous in the new state, Chişinău lost its title as Capital and moved into the background.

Between 1918 and 1940 the center of the city undertook large renovation work. In 1927 a monument to the famous prince Stephen III of Moldavia, by the artist Alexandru Plămădeală was erected.

In the chaos of the Second World War Chişinău was nearly completely destroyed. This began with the Soviet occupation led by the Red Army from 28 June 1940. As the city began to recover from the takeover, a devastating earthquake occurred on 10 November 1940. The epicenter of the quake, which measured 7.3 on the Richter scale, was in eastern Romania and subsequently led to substantial destruction in the city.

After scarcely one year the assault of modern-day Moldova by the German army began. From July 1941 the city suffered from large-scale shooting and heavy bombardments by Nazi air raids. The Red Army resistance held until Chişinău finally fell on 17 July 1941.

Following the occupation the city suffered from the characteristic mass murder of predominantly Jewish inhabitants. As had been seen elsewhere in Europe, the dwindling followers of Judaism were transported on trucks to the outskirts of the city. There they were then shot in partially dug pits. The number of Jews murdered during the occupation of the city is estimated at approximately 10,000 people.

As the War drew to a conclusion the former capital was pulled once more into heavy fighting as German troops retreated. After nearly six months of fighting Chişinău finally fell on 24 August 1944 to the Red Army. By this point the city had lost 70% of its buildings and constructions - the earthquake of 1940 and the air raids contributing to the largest part of this.

After the war the head of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, claimed the area around Bessarabien, to be in his own nation's sphere of influence. With the war completed, Stalin reorangised the political landscape of Eastern Europe, giving nominal independence to Romania and incorporating Moldova into the USSR. Thus Chişinău was once more made capital of the now 'autonomous' republic.

In the years 1947 to 1949 the architect Alexey Shchusev developed a plan with the aid of a team of architects for the gradual reconstruction of the city. 

The beginning of the 1950's saw a rapid population growth, with which the Soviets responded by constructing large-scale housing and palaces in the style of Stalinist architecture. This process continued under Nikita Khrushchev, who called for construction under the slogan "good, cheaper and built faster". The new architectural style brought about dramatic change and generated the style that dominates today, with large blocks of flats arranged in considerable settlements.

The period of the most significant development of the city was from 1971, when the Council of Ministers of the USSR has adopted a decision "About the measures for further development of Kishinev city", that secured more than one billon rubles of investments from the state budget, until 1991, when Moldova gained independence.

Chişinău is governed by the City Council and the City Mayor, both elected once every four years. The current mayor is Dorin Chirtoacă. Ursu is the former vice-mayor, between August 1994 and April 2005 was Serafim Urechean. Under the Moldovan constitution, Urechean - elected to parliament in 2005 - was prevented from holding an additional post to that of an MP. The Democratic Moldova Bloc leader accepted his mandate and in April resigned from his former position. During his 11 year term, Urechean committed himself to the restoration of the church tower of the "Catedrala Naşterea Domnului", as well as improvements in public transport. From 1994, Chişinău saw the construction and launch of new trolley bus lines.

Chişinău is the most economically-developed and industrialised city in Moldova. Chişinău is a major industrial and services centre; its main industries include consumer and electrical goods, building materials, machinery, plastics, rubber, and textiles. The main service fields are banking and shopping/commerce. 

The city is home to thirty-six universities, and to the Academy of Sciences of Moldova. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the city has become a relatively lively and well-provisioned capital, with a much higher standard of living than most rural areas.

Jons Jacob Berzelius

Jöns Jakob Berzelius (August 20, 1779 – August 7, 1848) was a Swedish chemist. He invented the modern chemical notation. Berzelius, John Dalton and Antoine Lavoisier are said to be the fathers of modern chemistry.

Berzelius was born in Linköping in Östergötland in Sweden. He studied at the school that is now known as Katedralskolan. After this, he studied at the Uppsala University to be a medical doctor. In 1802, he became a teacher. He became a professor in medicine and surgery at the Stockholm School of Surgery in 1807. In 1810, the school became a part of Medico-Chirurgiska Institutet - which later became the Karolinska Institute - and Berzelius became a professor in chemistry and pharmacy.

Not long after going to Stockholm, Berzelius wrote a chemistry textbook for his medical students. From this point, a long and productive career in chemistry began. While doing experiments in support of the textbook, he found the law of constant proportions. This law showed that inorganic compounds are made of different elements in proportion by weight. Based on this, in 1828, he created a table of relative atomic weights. On this table, oxygen was set to 100. The table had all of the elements known at the time. This work gave evidence of the atomic hypothesis that inorganic chemical compounds are made of atoms combined in whole number amounts. In learning that atomic weights are not integer multiples of hydrogen's, Berzelius also proved Prout's hypothesis wrong. Prout's hypothesis was that elements are built up from atoms of hydrogen.

In order to help his experiments, Berzelius created a system of chemical notation. In this notation, the elements were given simple written labels, for example, O for oxygen, or Fe for iron. The proportions of the elements was shown by numbers. This is the same basic system used today. The only difference is that instead of the subscript number used today (for example, HO), Berzelius used a superscript.

Berzelius found the chemical elements silicon, selenium, thorium, and cerium. Students working in Berzelius laboratory also found lithium and vanadium.

Berzelius also had an effect on biology. He was the first person to show the difference between organic compounds (those made with carbon), and inorganic compounds. He helped Gerhardus Johannes Mulder in his elemental analyses of organic compounds such as coffee, tea and many proteins. The term "protein" itself was created by Berzelius, after Mulder noticed that all proteins seemed to have the same empirical formula and might be made of a single type of a (very large) molecule.

Berzelius wrote very often. He helped many leading scientists (such as Mulder, Claude Louis Berthollet, Humphry Davy, Friedrich Wöhler and Eilhard Mitscherlich), and many less-notable scientists.

Berzeliusskolan, a school located next to his alma matter Katedralskolan, is named for him.

Antibody

Antibodies (also called immunoglobulins) are large Y-shaped proteins. They are found in the blood or other body fluids of vertebrates. Antibodies are the key element in the adaptive immune system. 

The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target called an antigen. Each tip of the "Y" of an antibody contains a structure (like a lock) that fits one particular key-like structure on an antigen. This binds the two structures together. 

Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can "tag" a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly. The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system.

Each antibody is different. They are all designed to attack only one kind of antigen (in practise, this means virus or bacteria). For instance, an antibody designed to destroy smallpox is unable to hit the Bubonic plague or the common cold. 

Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, that small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable. This allows millions of antibodies with different tip structures to exist. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. 

There are a vast number of microbe strains, and so vertebrates need millions of different antibodies. Actually, humans generate about 10 billion different antibodies, each capable of binding a distinct antigen site. 

This must be done with a very much smaller number of genes: the total human genome has only about 20,000 genes.

Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved. These allow vertebrate B cells to generate a huge pool of antibodies from a relatively small number of antibody genes.

The variety of antibodies is got by combining segments from a pool of genes in many different ways. Then, hyper-mutations occur in the binding site area of the antibody gene. This creates further diversity.

Condors are a species of bird. They are the largest flying birds that still exist. There are two species of condor, one that lives in the Andes, and another one, that lives in California. Condors are scavengers. They feed on carrion. Carrion is meat, that other animals leave behind. It can also be animals that died. 

"Condors" belong to the family of New World Vultures. There is also a family Old World Vultures, which contains eagles, kites, and hawks amongst others. The "Condors" are more closely related to the storks though.

The Andean condor, has a wingspan of between 274 and 310 cm, and weights around 11–15 kg.

The Californian Condor is smaller.

Oviedo is a city in the North of Spain and capital of the Principality of Asturias. It has about 210,000 inhabitants.

Oviedo was founded about 761 A.D. by two monks Maximus and Fromestanus who built a monastery dedicated to Saint Vincent. King Fruela I (757-768) confirmed the foundation and also built a palace and a cathedral dedicated to Saint Saviour.

King Alfonso II the Chaste (791-842) moved the capital of the kingdom of Asturias to Oviedo in 791. He enlarged the city with a new cathedral, palaces, churches and city walls. Examples of these buildings which are still existing are: San Julián de los Prados, ("St Julian in the fields"), also called "Santullano", the head of the church dedicated to San Tirso, ("Saint Thyrsus"), and the Cámara Santa, ("Holy Chamber") which is a chapel which belonged to the palace of the king.
During this period, it was discovered the tomb of the Apostle St James. The king sponsored and create the St James's Way to Santiago de Compostela in order to improve communications of the city and the kingdom as a way to open them to new ideas and influences from the rest of Europe. Its known that ambassadors from Charlemagne or Carles the Great visited Oviedo at the beginning of s. IX.

King Ramiro I (842-850) built the most important and brilliant buildings of the Kingdom of Asturias: Santa María del Naranco, ("St Mary of Naranco"), a hall for the king's rest, and San Miguel de Lillo, ("St Michael of Lillo"). These buildings are at the top of the Pre-Romanesque Asturian Art.

King Alfonso III the Great (866-910), built the only civil building of this period, the water fountain La Foncalada. 

King García I (910-914) moved the capital of the kingdom to León in 910. Since then, the bishops of Oviedo will take the responsibility of the development of the city and also the population and the importance of the city decreased. Even the St James's Way moved to León and Oviedo was left apart.

The Arts Academy of Oviedo started in the 17th century.

This change made Egypt a more socialist and modern country, as well as pushing forward pan-Arab nationalism through his policies, including a union with Syria that did not last very long.

Nasser is seen as one of the most important political figures in modern Arab history and politics. Under his leadership, Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal and a lot of other industries, and became important in stopping imperialism in the Arab World and Africa. He was also important in starting the Non-Aligned Movement. Nasser's version of pan-Arabism, which is often called ""Nasserism"", was very popular in the Arab world during the 1950s and 1960s. Even after the Israeli victory over the Arab armies in the Six-Day War damaged the way the public saw him, many Arabs still view Nasser as a symbol of Arab dignity and freedom.

Storks are a family of birds (Ciconiidae). They usually live near shallow bodies of water where they wade through the water, and catch small animals, like frogs, crabs, or small fish. Many species of stork are migratory, they spend the summer and the winter in different places. There are 19 different species of stork, in 6 genera. 

Probably the best known stork is the White Stork. It is known to build large nests in high places, like on chimneys. Stork nests are often very large. They may be used for many years. Beforehand, people believed storks were monogamous, that they only had one partner in life. More recent research has shown though, that they may change partners. They are attached to a nest almost as much as to a partner. 

The Marabou Stork, which lives in Africa, has a wingspan of up to 320 cm. This makes it the largest bird still alive, together with the Andean Condor.

Public house

Public houses (better known as pubs) are businesses that serve alcoholic drinks such as beer and ale, and usually also non-alcoholic drinks such as lemonade, coca cola, tea, coffee to be consumed within the limits of the public house. They are subject to the licensing laws of the country and may be closed down if not properly conducted. Many pubs also sell food such as fish and chips and meat pies. 

Pubs are found in English-speaking countries such as England, Ireland, Scotland, Canada, and the United States. In villages and small towns in many parts of England, Ireland, and Scotland, pubs are the center of community life. Some pubs hire bands or singers to entertain patrons. If the pub offers rooms where people can sleep at night, it is usually called an inn.

Public houses may be owned and operated in various different ways. Breweries may own a number of pubs themselves, or they may be run as franchises by large catering companies. However they are owned a pub will be entrusted to a "landlord" or "landlady". A variety of staff do different jobs to provide a good service. Bartenders (also called "barmen" or "barmaids") serve the drinks at the bar. In most pubs, the customer orders the drinks at the bar and waits for them to be prepared, then carries the drinks back to the tables or area of seating. However, some pubs hire servers, called waiters or waitresses, to bring drinks to people who are sitting at tables or in chairs. Some pubs also hire people to take away empty bottles and glasses though commonly the bartenders will do this as well.

Pubs that serve food have cooks, dishwashers, and servers to prepare, cook, and serve the food. Bands and singers who entertain patrons during the evening are not usually employees of the pub. Instead, the pub signs a contract with these entertainers, in which the entertainer promises to come to the pub on a specified day or night, in return for a sum of money.

Another type of business that serves alcohol is the nightclub. Like pubs, some nightclubs also serve food and have bands or singers as entertainers. Most people go to nightclubs because they enjoy the music and dancing. However, nightclubs often have a much wider selection of alcoholic drinks than pubs. Most nightclubs sell a number of different brands of spirits, liqeurs, wine, sherry, and apertifs. 

The bartenders (also called "barmen" or "barmaids") at nightclubs often make a much larger variety of mixed drinks, or cocktails, than those who work in pubs. Mixed drinks are alcoholic drinks that consist of one or more types of alcohol (e.g., rum, vodka, whiskey, etc.) mixed with flavorings such as orange juice, cream, chocolate syrup, or soda. Many mixed drinks also include ice, crushed ice, or sliced lime. Some well-known mixed drinks include the martini, the "Rum and Coke", and the "screwdriver" (orange juice mixed with vodka)

The Tapirs are a familiy of odd-toed ungulate mammals. They form the family Tapiridae with the only genus Tapirus.


Tapirs are about 2 m / 7 ft long and about 1 meter / 3 ft high. They weigh between 150 - 300 kg / 330 - 700 lb. 

Tapirs have a rounded body and very short stubby tails. Tapirs have hoofed toes, with four toes on the front feet and three toes on the hind feet. The Tapir's upper lip and nose have formed a short trunk, and they have a long tongue.

Tapirs have a short fur, with colors that are reddish-brown to grey to nearly black. Exceptions are the Mountain Tapir and the Asian Tapir. The Mountain Tapir has longer wooly fur. The Asian Tapir has a black front part and legs, and a white middle part and back.
All baby tapirs have brown fur, with lighter stripes and dots for camouflage.

Tapirs cannot see very well, but they have good hearing and a very good sense of smell. Tapirs also swim very well.

Tapirs live in of South America and Central America, except the Asian Tapir which lives in Southeast Asia. 
Tapirs live in dense forests, and close to water.

Tapirs are active at night. They eat leaves, fruit, berries, vegetables and nuts. 

Tapirs live alone. After a pregnancy of about 13 months, the female gives birth to a single baby. After half a year the baby starts to lose the baby-coloring of its fur. When the young tapir is one year old it looks like an adult tapir, and it leaves its mother. Tapirs become mature when they are 4 years old. Tapirs can become 25 - 30 years old.

Cromwell current

The Cromwell current is the name of a submarine river. It was discovered in 1952 by the scientst Thomas Cromwell. It is 250 miles (400 km) wide. It flows to the east. The current appears about 300 feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean at the equator. 

The "Cromwell current" carries a lot of oxygen and nutrients. It is very rich in marine life.

Subduction

Subduction is when two tectonic plates meet. One of the plates is pushed under the other into the Earth's mantle. Subduction causes the most powerful earthquakes in the world. Earthquakes caused by subduction can lead to tsunamis. 

Areas where subduction occurs are called subduction zones. Subduction zones are all around the world in places like Indonesia, Seattle, Washington and in the Himalaya mountain range in Nepal.

Tattoo

A tattoo is a permanent mark made by putting ink into the skin. Tattoos may be made on human or animal skin. Tattoos on humans are a type of body modification, but tattoos on animals are most often used for identification. People sometimes get tattoos to show that they belong to a gang or culture group. 

Humans get tattoos in businesses called "tattoo parlors". Getting a tattoo involves pain, although how much pain is different from person to person, and also depends on what body part is being tattooed. Most tattoos today are given using an electric tattoo machine, which uses needles to put ink into the body.
Some people who have tattoos wish that they had not gotten them. Tattoos can be taken off with laser surgery, but this is painful and often requires several visits to a dermatologist or skin care professional.

Tattooing is an ancient art. Ötzi the Iceman, a man who lived around 3300 BC and whose mummy was found in 1991, had 57 tattoos. These tattoos, which were made of soot, were possibly part of an early form of acupuncture. Tattoos have also been found on mummies from ancient civilizations in Egypt and Nubia. 

Tattoos became popular in the Western world after contact with American Indians and Polynesians during the 1700s. James Cook reported that he had seen tattooing being done when he was in Tahiti in 1769. The word "tattoo" comes from the Tahitian word "tatau". Polynesian peoples like the Māori in New Zealand have a tradition of face tattoos (called "moko") which are sacred and have special meaning related to status and tribal history.

Constructed language

An artificial or constructed language (sometimes called a conlang) is a language that has been created by a person or small group, instead of being formed naturally as part of a culture. Some constructed languages are designed for use in human communication (like the well-known Esperanto). Others are created for use in fiction, linguistic experiments, secret codes, or simply because the maker likes to play language games.

Constructed languages can be split into a priori languages, which are made from scratch, and a posteriori languages, which borrow words and grammar from existing languages.

Constructed languages can also be split into groups. These groups are:

Some constructed languages also have constructed scripts to write them.

Pronghorn

The Pronghorn ("Antilocapra americana") is an even-toed ungulate mammal, the only living member of the family Antilocapridae. 

The pronghorn is a small ruminant mammal which looks a bit like an antelope.

The antilocaprids evolved in North America, where they filled a niche similar to that of the bovids that evolved in the Old World. 

During the Miocene and Pliocene, they were a diverse and successful group, with many different species. Some had horns with bizarre shapes, or had four, or even six, horns.

The Pronghorn has a yellowish-brown to reddish-brown colored fur with a white underside, and white stripes on the neck and around the mouth. Male pronghorns also have black markings on the neck and face. The males have horns that are up to 25 cm long. Females usually have no horns; if they have horns they are very short.

The Pronghorn lives in North America. It lives in the prairies, but sometimes also in the desert and the Rocky Mountains. 

Pronghorns can be active at any time during day or night, but they are mostly active during twilight. Pronghorns eat grass, but also leaves and herbs. 

In summer, adult male pronghorns fight with other males for a territory. In this territory the male keeps a group of females with which he mates in September. Young males that do not yet fight for a territory form small groups, and old weak males live alone. Females live in groups of about 20 animals. When the female is close to giving birth, it leaves the group for a time to give birth to its offspring. 

After a pregnancy of 8½ months the female gives birth to 1-2 babies, seldom 3. The babies hide for three days, and after a week they can run with their mother. A pronghorn baby has grey fur, and after 3 months it has the adult fur coloring. They drink milk for 5-6 months, and start to eat grass after three weeks. Females become mature when they are 15-16 months old, and males become mature when they are 24 months old.

Graphical User Interfaces and Consoles

Computers can display information and let the user give commands to it using two methods: a Command Line Interface (CLI) or a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

In a Command Line Interface, the user types commands using the keyboard to tell the computer to take an action. For example, the more command available in most operating systems will display the contents of a file. Sometimes people call CLI “Console”, but consoles can be GUI, too.

In a Graphical User Interface, the user can use the computer mouse to click on buttons. For example, your web browser probably has a Print icon to print this page.

Graphical User Interfaces are generally thought more easy to start to use than Command lines, whereas Command lines are faster than Graphical User Interfaces and can be used to give special commands to the computer.

Water Deer

The Water Deer ("Hydropotes inermis") is an even-toed ungulate mammal of the deer family. It is the only member of the subfamily Hydropotinae. There are two subspecies: the Chinese Water Deer ("Hydropotes inermis inermis") and the Korean Water Deer ("Hydropotes inermis argyropus").

Water Deer are small deer: they are about 90 cm long and about 50 cm high. They weigh about 13 kg. The Water Deer has yellowish-brown fur, with a white chin and throat. Both males and females do not have antlers. Males have long upper canine teeth (called tusks), which can be up to 5 cm long.

The Water Deer originally lived in China and Korea. Today there are also small wild populations in England and France. 
Water Deer live close to water: in swamps and on the shores of rivers and lakes. 

Water Deer eat grasses and reeds. They also eat grains and vegetables from fields.

Water Deer live alone, but sometimes they form small groups. 

After a pregnancy of 200 days the female gives birth to 2-4 babies. A Water Deer baby has white dots and stripes on its fur, which disappear after 8 weeks. They drink milk for 3 months. When the young Water Deer are 6 months old they are independent and leave their mothers. They become mature when they are 1 year old.

Orchestration

Orchestration in music can have two meanings:

It can mean: the study of how to write music for an orchestra.

It can also mean the list of instruments that are used in a particular piece of music.

People who want to compose music for orchestras need to study orchestration. They can do this by reading books about orchestration, but also they can do this by studying orchestral scores and listening to orchestras in concerts or on CDs. Students at music colleges will also practise orchestration by taking piano music and arranging it for orchestra.

The word instrumentation means almost the same thing as “orchestration”. “Instrumentation” means: understanding each instrument and knowing about all the sounds they can make. It can be about any music with instruments, whereas “orchestration” refers to the orchestra from its beginnings in the 17th century to the present.

Orchestration is all about understanding how to write well for different instruments, how to combine them so that they sound well together and balance well.

Sometimes composers leave the orchestration of their works to other people. Leonard Bernstein is famous as the composer of "West Side Story", but although he composed all the notes he left it to other people to orchestrate. The composer Maurice Ravel took a piano piece by Modest Mussorgsky (who had died forty years earlier) called "Pictures at an Exhibition" and arranged it for orchestra. Most people know this version rather than Mussorgsky’s piano version.

Hector Berlioz and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov are two famous composers who were particularly brilliant at writing for orchestra. They both wrote books on orchestration which are still very useful today.

Blockbusters

Blockbusters was a game show that aired from 1980 to 1987.

One team of two people plays against a solo person to see if two heads are better than one. The team is represented by the color white while the solo player is represented by the color red. There is a game board with letters inside spaces shaped like a hexagon. A player picks a letter on the board, and host Bill Cullen asks a question to see how much the players know. Whoever rings in first and gets the answer right gets their color put on the board in the space where the corresponding letter once was. If the team makes a connection from left to right, they win. If the solo player makes a connection from top to bottom, he/she wins.

Whoever wins after two games goes on to play the "Gold Rush" for a shot at an extra $5,000. The board is the same, except that the spaces are colored gold, and sometimes more than one letter is seen in each space. The object of the game is to make a connection across the board within the 60 second time limit. If they do, they win the $5,000. If they miss a question, a block will go up and they will have to work their way around it.

"Blockbusters" aired on the NBC network and was hosted by Bill Cullen from 1980 to 1982. Then in 1987, comedian Bill Rafferty hosted a new version, which ended the same year.

Paraná (state)

Paraná is a state in Southern Brazil, bordering Paraguay and Argentina. Its capital is Curitiba - the largest city in the south of the country - and it is a famous state because of Itaipu Dam and the Iguaçu Falls.

Paraná is bounded on the north by São Paulo, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by Santa Catarina and the Misiones Province of Argentina, and on the west by Mato Grosso do Sul and the republic of Paraguay, with the Paraná River as its western boundary line.

Paraná is one of the Brazilian states that shows the most signs of recent European colonization. Most of the population are descendants of European settlers, and is one of the most ethnically diverse. Waves of European immigrants started arriving after 1850, mainly Germans, Italians, Poles and Ukrainians. The development of the state is closely linked to the arrival of the immigrants. Nowadays, migrants from other Brazilian states (especially from the São Paulo, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and the Northeast Region) come to Paraná in search of a better life.

People of Polish descent predominate in the central and south regions, mainly around Curitiba. Italians predominate in the capital, Curitiba, and in the coast. People of Ukrainian descent predominate in a few cities, such as Prudentópolis; many Ukrainians are found throughout the state. Germans predominate in a few cities, such as Rolândia. The Portuguese and their descendants are present in large numbers in almost all towns.

People of mixed-race ancestry predominate in a few towns in the north. There is a important Muslim Lebanese and Syrian community around Foz do Iguaçu. In the north, Japanese people are very numerous.

The main cities of the state are:

Radio Caracas Television (or RCTV) is one of the largest and most important television stations in Venezuela. It can be seen in all of Venezuela on channel 2. It was the third television station to start up in Venezuela (Televisiora Nacional was the first and Televisa was the second). Both Televisora Nacional and Televisa are no longer on, so RCTV is now the oldest television station in Venezuela. Venevision is RCTV's main rival. RCTV's offices can be found in the center of Caracas.

Radio Caracas Television began on November 15, 1953 (during the dictatorship of General Marcos Perez Jimenez). In 1953, plays, news, and sports were pretty much the only thing seen on RCTV, but by 1954, they began making soap operas (also known as telenovelas). Telenovelas are now RCTV's most liked and seen programs.

In the 1960's, RCTV began videotaping their programs, as they used to be made live. In 1961, there was small fire at RCTV. On July 21, 1969, RCTV was on of the only television station in Venezuela that showed the first visit to the moon by man.

In 1972, RCTV began selling some of its shows to other countries and television stations. The three hundred chaptered telenovela, "La Usurpadora" was the first telenovela to be sold to other countries. Today, RCTV's shows are said to be seen in more than 60 countries and heard in more than 20 languages. In 1974, RCTV began recording some of their programs in color. "Doña Barbara", which was made from a book written by Romulo Gallegos, was RCTV's first show made in color. Radio Caracas Television started the "Fundacion Academia Nacional de Ciencias y Artes de Cine" on November 15, 1978.

In the year 1981, RCTV began recording all of their programs in color.

On November 15, 1999, RCTV had been on 16,000 days.

On July 18, 2005, Empresas 1BC president Marcel Granier and RCTV president Eladio Larez opened up the new building where RCTV's news show, "El Observador", will be made.

<doc id="36802" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36802" title="AIDS">
AIDS

Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a syndrome caused by a virus called HIV.


About 3,000,000 people died because of AIDS in 2004. About 500,000 of these people were children. About 40,000,000 people in the world had HIV in 2004.

Most of the people who have HIV live in Africa. Most of the children who die from AIDS live in Africa.

Many people with HIV do not know they have it. The number of people with HIV is unknown.

Scientists believe the first person who got HIV was a person in Africa. This happened when Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) went from chimpanzees to humans.

HIV attacks the immune system. This is how the body fights infections. This is also how the body helps stop cancers. So people with HIV are more likely to have infections and cancers. They may even die of minor illnesses like the common cold, which normally healthy people can recover from. 

Not every person who has HIV has AIDS. When people first get HIV they are not very sick. They can be healthy for years. When they get sick from HIV it is called AIDS.

If someone has HIV they are called "HIV positive". 

Someone has AIDS if they have HIV and either:

Some of the infections and cancers that people with AIDS get, most healthy people do not get. People who have good immune systems do not get these diseases. Many of these diseases are called "AIDS defining illnesses". Some AIDS defining illnesses are:

The blood test that defines AIDS is the CD4 T-cell count. T-cells are white blood cells. These are cells that fight infection. HIV goes into T-cells and kills them. When HIV infection gets very bad the number of CD4 T-cells in the blood goes down. CD4 is a protein outside of the T-cell. Some T-cells have this protein. They are called "CD4 positive T-cells", "CD4 T-cells" or sometimes "T4 cells".

When someone has HIV and their CD4 T-cell count (number of cells in the blood) is below 200 cells/microliter it means they have AIDS.

There are medicines that help people with AIDS. These are called "antiretroviral" medicines (or "antiretrovirals".) Anti- means against. HIV is a retrovirus. So "antiretroviral" means it fights retroviruses.

Antiretrovirals cannot cure AIDS. This means they cannot make all of the virus leave a person's body. But they can make people with AIDS more healthy. Antiretrovirals help people fight the HIV virus. This makes their immune systems work better. So antiretrovirals are a "treatment" but not a "cure" for HIV.

People with HIV/AIDS who take antiretroviral medicines live longer. They live longer without getting "AIDS defining illnesses". But after a long time, the HIV virus learns how to fight the antiretrovirals. The HIV virus is not killed by this medicine. HIV becomes "resistant" to the medicine. Then the "resistant" HIV hurts the immune system and the person may get AIDS.

Sometimes when HIV is resistant to one medicine, another medicine can be used. To make less resistance happen, people with AIDS take more than one medicine at the same time. They may take 2–4 medicines at once. This is sometimes called a "cocktail" or "AIDS cocktail".

When HIV gets resistant to one medicine, this is changed to another medicine. So the "AIDS cocktail" that people with AIDS take changes over time. But after a long time, the HIV learns to be resistant to "many" drugs. This is called "multi-drug-resistant" (acronym MDR) HIV. After the HIV in a person has MDR-HIV there may be no more medicines to treat them. So scientists keep trying to find new medicines to fight HIV.
The five most important HIV medicines are:

Many people who die of AIDS, especially in Africa, leave behind children who are still alive, and who may need help being taken care of. These children are called AIDS orphans.

There are many ways people fight the "AIDS epidemic".

The most important way to stop HIV/AIDS is education. People can get HIV from sex and from blood. Children can also get HIV from their mothers (when they grow inside pregnant mothers and when they drink breast milk.)
Sex is one way to get HIV. If people use condoms when they have sex, there is a much smaller chance of catching HIV.

A person can also get HIV by "sharing needles". This means using a needle that has not been cleaned after someone else has used it. Some people who take illegal drugs like heroin and cocaine take these drugs by needle. Some of these people share needles. If one person has HIV and he shares his needles, he can give HIV to other people. But if people have clean needles or if they know how to clean needles, they do not get HIV as much.

Many people do not know that condoms and clean needles help stop HIV. They may not even "know" that sharing needles and sex with someone who has HIV can make them get HIV. Even if people know about condoms and clean needles, they may not "have" condoms and clean needles.

There are some people who do not want people to "know" about condoms or clean needles, or do not want people to have condoms or clean needles. They believe that if people know about condoms and have condoms they will have more sex. They believe that if people have clean needles they will use illegal drugs more. Many of these people think this because of their religion. For example, the Catholic church does not want people to have or use condoms. They do not want people to have condoms because they do not think people should have sex unless they are married. They also think that married people should not use condoms, because they believe that if people have sex, it should only be to make a baby.

Scientists who study (look at and learn about) people who use condoms, see that if teenagers (children 13–19) learn about condoms (and other birth control) they have "less" unsafe sex. Scientists see that learning about these things does not make teenagers start having sex earlier. The teenagers also have "safer" sex. Safer sex means doing things (like wearing condoms) to try not to get pregnant or get sexually transmitted diseases (STDs or STIs) like HIV, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Using a condom works very well for keeping people from getting pregnant or getting STDs if people know how to use a condom the right way. 

Scientists have also learned that if a city has a needle exchange program it will have fewer people who use illegal drugs. "Needle exchange programs" are where people can come in and trade dirty needles for clean needles. This means that "if" they use drugs they will be more safe. But needle exchange programs do more than give people clean needles. They teach people about drugs. If people want to stop using drugs, they help them. 

The best way to stop HIV is thought to be a vaccine. There is no vaccine for HIV yet. Many scientists are looking for an HIV vaccine. Even one that protected some people from HIV would save millions of people's lives.

Some scientists think that HIV is not the cause of AIDS. They think AIDS is the result of illegal drug use, drugs used to treat HIV infection, malnutrition, poverty, multiple infections, and other assaults on the immune system. Most scientists disagree with this viewpoint and feel the evidence for HIV as the cause of AIDS is overwhelming. See the other websites below.

These sites may not be simple.

Ssirûm, or Korean wrestling, is a very old sport. It is shown in pictures that are painted on walls in the ancient graves in Korea. 

This kind of wrestling was formed in Korea. It took place on days of "public enjoyment" that were created by custom. Similar to Sumo. the man who stays on his feet until the end was the winner. He was given the title "changsa" ("the athlete" or "the strong man"). He was also given an ox. 

As Korea grew industrially, this type of wrestling has become a real sport. It has support in the form of the teams of professional athletes coming from colleges and universities. There are also organizations for the national Championship Ssirum Changsa. There are competitions in the country. 

Two fighters fight on the sand inside a circle. They each put on "satpa" - a piece of cloth that ties around the waist and thighs. Using their hands, legs backs, they try to make the other person fall. 

Most wrestlers are in height and in weight. The fights can seem slow at first they are actually very dynamic. 

Li Man-ki is one of the most well known sportsmen in this sport. In the 1980s, he won the title "changsa" ("jangsa") many times. He has caused much of the interest of this sport.

Queensland is a state in eastern Australia. It is the second largest state by area and the third largest state by population. It has 4,000,000 people. Its capital city is Brisbane. It occupies the north-east corner of the continent. The state is neighboured by the Northern Territory to the west, South Australia to the south-west and New South Wales to the south. To the east, Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and Pacific Ocean.

The area was first colonised by native Australians and Torres Strait Islanders, who arrived between 40 000 and 65 000 years ago. Later, Queensland was made a British Crown Colony that was separated from New South Wales in 1859. The area that currently forms Brisbane was originally the Moreton Bay punishment colony, intended as a place for criminals with a repeated offence history who had offended while serving out their sentences in New South Wales. The state later encouraged free settlement, and today Queensland's economy is dominated by the agricultural, tourist and natural resource sectors.

The population is concentrated in the south-east corner, which includes the capital Brisbane, Ipswich, Logan City, and the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast. Other major regional centres include Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton, Bundaberg, Toowoomba, and Mount Isa. Queensland is often nicknamed the Sunshine State, since it enjoys warm weather and a sizable portion of the state is in the tropics.

Airships are kind of aircraft. Airships stay in the sky by floating. This is different from aeroplanes that stay in the sky by moving. An airship floats like a balloon. But an airship is different from a balloon. An airship has an engine for power and a way to control its direction of movement. A balloon does not have an engine or a way to control its direction of movement.

Some people may use the word "airship" to mean any kind of aircraft. This is not exactly correct. Technical people use the word "airship" only to mean a aircraft that floats and has both an engine and a way to control its direction of movement.

There are three kinds of airships. The difference is the amount of structure in the airship.

Blimps were used by the United States in WWII to fight against submarines. Blimps are now used mostly for advertising.

made by the Zeppelin airship company. It burned when it was landing on May 6, 1937. There were 97 people on the airship when the fire started. The fire killed 35 of these people and one person on the ground. There is a very famous movie of the airship fire.

In the early 1980s, Dickinson was part of the band Samson. He left Samson in 1981. Later that year, after Paul Di'Anno left Iron Maiden, Dickinson was chosen to be the band's new singer. During the 1980s, Iron Maiden was very popular, and Dickinson's singing was a big part of this. 

In 1990, Dickinson made his first solo album, called "Tattooed Millionaire". In 1993, he left Iron Maiden to become only a solo artist. He released five solo albums during the 1990s, but they were not as popular as his work with Iron Maiden had been.

In 1999, Dickinson joined Iron Maiden again, and soon after the band made a new album, Brave New World. Since then, he has stayed as a part of Iron Maiden as well as recording music both by himself and with other people.

Outside of music, Dickinson is interested in fencing, has written both books and a script based on one of his albums for a screenplay, and has worked in the radio industry.

He is also a pilot for Astraeus Airlines, and became marketing director for the airline in September 2010.

Étude

An étude (said "ay-TOOD"; French for study) is a short piece of music written to help the player to become a better player. They are usually quite difficult. Sometimes they are just called "studies". Composers such as the pianist Carl Czerny and the violinist Otakar Ševčik wrote lots of études. Each one concentrates on a technical problem: fast scale passages, arpeggios, wide leaps, chords or, for string players, different ways of bowing.

The tradition of writing études started in the early 19th century, when the piano started to become popular. Many of the études from that time are still very popular today, including those by Muzio Clementi.

Frédéric Chopin wrote two sets of études which are very good for developing piano technique. Franz Liszt also wrote some very difficult études. These two composers' études are known for being not only good for training but also beautiful. Because of this, they are sometimes even performed in concerts.

Rick Deckard is forced to hunt down some replicants in Los Angeles.

Some movie critics did not like "Blade Runner" because they thought it was slow, but others liked its many ideas. The movie did not sell many tickets in North American movie theaters but was more popular in other countries. Even though it did not make much money, it was liked very much by teachers and science fiction fans. "Blade Runner" looked good and made the future look very dark and old. The movie showed important ideas of the 21st century such as globalization and genetic engineering. "Blade Runner" is an important example of cyberpunk and people believe it has changed the world and affected many cultures. "Blade Runner" made Hollywood interested in stories written by Philip K.

Seven versions of "Blade Runner" exist because of changes made by different people. The producers took Scott's cut and changed some things about it, which Scott did not like. In 1992, Scott released a Director's Cut version, which was made very fast. It cut the ending of the movie and removed the voice-over. Warner Bros. released the Final Cut, a new 25th anniversary version of the movie, in October 2007. It features some new scenes and removes some of the visible special effect.

Celebrity

A celebrity is a person who is well known and gets lots of public attention, or attention from other people. A person whom the public knows such as a person in government might be well known but not a celebrity unless something else makes them interesting to other people. Usually a person becomes a celebrity from entertainment such as people who are in movies, people who sing songs, and someone who plays a sport.

People who act in movies and television actors, people who sing are usually celebrities. High-ranking politicians, people who tell people the news, television show hosts, people who go to outer space, major-league athletes and people who sing songs are also sometimes celebrities. Sometimes people such as Mother Teresa have achieved fame because they help people who were in need and are saintly.

Individuals can achieve celebrity, but there are also many celebrity families, such as various royal families (often interest in these will be highest when scandal is involved, as with the House of Windsor) and artistic 'dynasties' e.g. the Barrymore, Cassidy (David and Shaun Cassidy), the Osmonds, Osbournes, Jackson and Baldwin families, as well as the Kennedys and some sports families.

Because celebrities have fame similar to that of royalty or gods in the past, some people are curious about their private lives, and dislike celebrities for their rewards. Many think that celebrities do not work as hard as non-celebrities and that celebrities do not deserve to be treated specially. Since their failures are made public celebrities can been seen as having lower moral values than most people. Not all celebrities exhibit bad behaviour and sometimes they do things that are good and help people.

A recent phenomenon has occurred wherein intricate marketing plans are developed in order to lure adolescents into purchasing celebrity related goods. 
Some have argued that the idea of "celebrity" is self-reinforcing and becoming empty: some celebrities are not famous for their actions, but simply famous for their fame and money. For example, Paris Hilton would not be a public figure without her money, but her family's importance has created and helps her be well known and a celebrity. Hilton is a special celebrity; a part of her fame is for doing bad things other celebrities do. People call people like Paris "famous for being famous." Some believe she is doing it on purpose, but in many ways, people like Hilton and other 21st century celebrities are just doing what other celebrities did before.

Epinephrine

Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a hormone in the body. The Latin roots ad-+renes and the Greek roots epi-+nephros both mean into/onto the kidney, which is a reference to the adrenal glands. In medical jargon, epinephrine is shortened to just "epi" (pronounced eh-pee). 

Epinephrine is very important in short-term stress reaction (see Fight or Flight reaction). Epinephrine increases heart rate, making the pupils bigger, making the blood vessels in the legs bigger, and weakens the immune system for a short time. Because of this, epinephrine is a common treatment for allergy such as Anaphylaxis. Bad reactions to epinephrine include heart palpitations, tachycardia, anxiety, headache, tremor, hypertension, and acute pulmonary edema.

When inhaled as a mist epinephrine causes the muscles that surround the parts of the lung that holds air to relax, which allows more air into the lungs. This is helpful in asthma or bronchiolitis.

February Revolution

The February Revolution (Russian: Февральская Революция/Fevralskaya Revolyuziya) of the year 1917 was a revolution that ended Tsarist rule and replaced it with a Provisional Government. The name goes back to the Julian calendar that was used at the time in Russia. Causes of the February Revolution were the effects of the First World War, which msfr the social tensions of the Vorkriegszeit bigger.

Industrialisation had already spread before what happened in 1917, from Petrograd (called Saint Petersburg since August of 1917) and other cities. When Russia lost the Crimean War in 1856 against England and France, it was obvious that a fundamental economic and social renewal of the empire was necessary. Large reforms followed, including the abolition of serfdom in 1861, judicial reform in 1864 and the establishment of national government groups, called Semstwos, in 1864. Also, this strategy aimed for the introduction of industrial growth.

Russia went through an economic crisis during the Crimean War. The Tsar, Russia's leader, did not keep his country up to date with new weapons and machines. After the war, he tried to change this and increased the industrial capacities of Russia. This was accomplished with national growth in industry. However this was very expensive and cost the Russian people a lot of money.

The economic, social and administrative change was mostly in cities with a modern way of living. To change a country like Russia and get ready to develop more modern industry, new laws were made to increase the ability of regional leaders to do work. These laws applied at this time as progressive, at them aligned many their life goals and habits. The cultural modernization, to which also the emergence of a journalistic public belonged, ran out with all slavophilen return flows on a go-west, up to the Rezeption and most independent developments of the new styles within the ranges of the literature and art. An intelligence in such a way specified enstand, which was for reforms unlocked and less and less ready to be able to be limited in its public acting of a pervasive state. It would be from today's viewpoint wrong to equate the Inteligenz and opposition only quite had „intelligently “and „in a revolutionary manner “not the same meaning.

Of Russia national economy it was at present around the year 1916 still in a so high agriculturally that it could not give a revolution without the farmers. From demographic explosion sinking agrarian productivity findings were confronted to the old, still from a fewer time coming scenario of a vicious circle, which pointed Moscow at least in the region on a market-focused region in Russia.

Agrarian social protest was usually spontaneous and short-lived - not only in Russia -. The farmers returned again to their hut, if they had taken themselves, which they wanted. Like that it was in the hot autumn of the yearly 1905, and such a scenario took place just as in the late summer of the yearly 1917 again. It remained completely calm after beginning of war in the year 1914. Since the large majority of the recruits came from villages, there was here hardly still someone, which could itself have raised against the authority.

With all that the question remains openly, why farmers revolted of course within living memory against their direct gentlemen, but this never together with intelligence, had done. Only this new connection, between the farmers in the rural regions and the inhabitants of the cities, lent revolutionary quality to the agrarian social protest. To all appearances the outbreak of the revolution with long-term changes has to do.

The war brought Russia losses of more than a million dead one. The war had begun, as in all European states, with a national high feeling. It was coined/shaped for the Zarenreich however after the turn at the east front with the battle by Gorlice Tarnow of the yearly 1915 to a series of sensitive defeats. The legitimacy of the autocracy of the tsarist house Romanow was weakened still by the fact that Nikolaus II. 1915 had taken over personally the command over the armed forces and thus each further retreat and each further defeat damaged the reputation of the regime.

All this long and medium-term disintegrative and conflict-laden developments accepted, under the additional load of the war, a new quality. In synchronischer Verschlingung its effect on the displeasure multiplied workers and farmers. The Aufwallung of national unanimity (Burgfrieden), which it in the August of the yearly 1914 also in tsarist Russia gave, held not for a long time. At the latest in the September of the yearly 1915, when the Zar sent the parliament once more home, the tensions solidified themselves to contrasts, which hardly still permitted a compromise under keeping of the internal peace.

Tsar Nicholas II instructed the murder of political opponents and installed at short notice an informer system generally speaking for the country. In the year 1915 he took over the military instruction of the troops during the First World War. Then after, the tsarist army faced disgraceful defeats. At the Petersburger Blutsonntag it let its secret police and the military shoot at demonstrators, suffocated each rebellion in the germ. Finally, Nicholas II had to permit a choice nevertheless to the Duma. Nicholas II ignored the advice of his former Minister of Finance Sergei Juljewitsch Witte, which snapped him and recommended comprehensive reforms. Arbitrarily the condition broke several times. The beginning of the First World War represented the beginning of the end. The frequent defeats, hunger emergencies and the catastrophic supply situation of the population led in the long run to the revolution. In the worst cases, they agreed upon Burgfrieden, which should secure only a keeping still of the opposition within the war, broke quite fast. The increasing protest readiness of the population shows up in the Duma, which were dominated by representatives of the middle class and the aristocracy. In the Duma formed since 1915 „the progressive block “, which reflected embittering over the autocratic policy Nicholas' II. „The progressive block “was the strongest parliamentary opposition since the revolution of 1905.

Flag of Russia

The flag of Russia is the Trikolore of the panslvian colors. It has three equal large horizontal strips: white on top, blue in the middle, and red on the bottom. The Trikolore of the panslawischen colors is used also in the flags of many other slvic nations (e.g. Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Slovakia and the Czech Republic).

When Tsar Peter I. traveled in the year 1699 to the Netherlands, in order to get more shipbuilding experience, he recognized the necessity that Russia needed its own flag for its navy. It also had a name from Iraq.

The new Russian flag should follow the model of the flag of the Netherlands (at that time three horizontal strips orange-white-blue in addition, red-white-blue after 1630), but use colors from Russia. Peter the large one selected the colors from the coat of arms of the Principality of Moscow: On red background a white knight on a white horse rides, wrapped into a blue coat and blue sign carrying. Later the three colors were interpreted also than symbol for the three state-carrying ostslawischen peoples in the Russian Zarenreich: White for the “white Russians”, blue for the “small Russians” and red for the “large Russians”.

This flag became to 7. May 1883 to the official national flag of Russia explains. When the Bolsheviks 1917 seized power, they changed the national flag. On 22 August 1991 the white-blue-red Tricolor was determined again to the Russian national flag.

Peter I. gave also another flag to the country: the so-called imperial flag of Russia. It consists of a blue St Andrews cross on white reason. This flag was used alternatively for the Trikolore, on the battlegrounds and at the handels and war navy dominated it even. The flag is this very day the official flag of the Russian war navy.

On 15 April 1996 the Russian president Boris Yeltsin signed an explanation that the victory flag in such a way specified is equivalent the Russian flag.

The "victory flag" is a variant of the flag, at the 1. May 1945 over Reichstag was go-eaten and the end of the Second World War in Europe symbolized. The difference to the flag of the Soviet Union is that the star is somewhat larger and "hammer and Sichel" are distant.

Anaphylaxis

Anaphylaxis is a severe and fast multi-system allergic reaction. Anaphylaxis is triggered by a substance, called an allergen, that the body believes is bad. Very small amounts of allergens can still cause anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a very bad medical emergency, as the airway quickly closes. The brain can not survive more than a few minutes without oxygen. Death within minutes is possible. The worst type, called "anaphylactic shock", will cause death very quickly if not treated.

Calling for help is very important when dealing with anaphylaxis because medical help is needed immediately. CPR or rescue breathing may be necessary if the patient stops breathing on their own. Epinephrine should be given to the person right away, because the epinephrine prevents the airway from narrowing even more and keeps the heart beating. Most people who have been diagnosed with anaphylaxis carry an EpiPen (pictured) or something similar to use in the event of anaphylactic shock. EpiPens contain epinephrine.

Hypertension

Hypertension, also called High blood pressure, HTN, or HPN, is a disease where your blood pressure is always above average.

There is no fixed point when blood pressure is considered "high". Generally speaking, if someone's blood pressure stays at 140/90 torr (a unit of pressure) or above in both arms, they are said to have high blood pressure. A recent report has defined blood pressure 120/80 torr to 139/89 torr as "prehypertension." Prehypertension is not a disease, but means that a person has a high chance of developing hypertension. In patients with diabetes mellitus or kidney disease, studies have shown that blood pressure over 130/80 torr should be considered a risk factor and may need treatment. A number of factors increase the risk of developing hypertension, including high salt use, being overweight, occupation, drinking alcohol, family size, too much noise and crowding. High salt use has received the greatest attention. About 60% of hypertension patients are affected by salt use.

Hypertension is one of the most common complex inherited disorders. More than 50 genes have been examined in studies of hypertension, and the number is constantly growing.
Renal Hypertension is caused by renal disease. What it does is decreases perfusion of renal tissue due to stenosis of a main or branch renal artery activates the renin-angiotensin system. 

While high elevated blood pressure alone is not an illness, it often requires treatment due to its short- and long-term effects on many organs. The risk is increased for strokes, heart attack, heart failure, damage to the eye, and renal failure.

Although few women of childbearing age have high blood pressure, up to 10% develop hypertension of pregnancy.

Diagnosis of hypertension is generally on the basis of a persistently high blood pressure. Usually this needs three separate measurements at least one week apart. Obtaining correct blood pressure measurements depends on following several rules and understanding the many factors that influence blood pressure readings.
For instance, measurements in control of hypertension should be at least one hour after caffeine, 30 minutes after smoking and without any stress. Cuff size is also important. The cuff should go right around and cover two-thirds of the length of the upper arm. You should be sitting for at least five minutes.

Doctors recommend weight loss and regular exercise as the first steps in treating mild to moderate hypertension. These steps are highly effective in reducing blood pressure, but easier to suggest than to achieve, and most patients with moderate or severe hypertension end up requiring indefinite drug therapy to bring their blood pressure down to a safe level. Stopping smoking, does not directly reduce blood pressure, but it is very important for people with hypertension because it reduces the risk of many dangerous outcomes of hypertension, such as stroke and/or heart attack. Mild hypertension can usually be treated by diet, exercise, and improved physical fitness. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fat-free dairy foods, and foods low in fat and salt lowers blood pressure in people with hypertension. Regular mild exercise improves blood flow, and helps to lower blood pressure. Reduction of environmental stressors such as high sound levels and over-illumination can be an additional method of ameliorating hypertension.

There are many medications for treating hypertension, called antihypertensives, which lower blood pressure. Reducing blood pressure by 5-6 torr can decrease the risk of stroke by 40%, reduce coronary heart disease by 15-20%, and reduce the likelihood of heart failure. Commonly used drugs include beta blockers such as metoprolol, atenolol, labetalol, carvedilol, ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril, quinapril, fosinopril, captopril, enalapril, ramipril; angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) such as losartan, valsartan, irbesartan; calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, verapamil; diuretics, such as chlortalidone, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), combination products (usually contains HCTZ and another drug), and alpha blockers such as terazosin and prazosin.

The aim of treatment should be blood pressure control (<140/90 torr for most patients, and lower in certain contexts such as diabetes or kidney disease. Each added drug may reduce the systolic blood pressure by 5-10 torr, so often many drugs are necessary to control blood pressure.

It is the amount of goods that people want to buy at a given price. Prices go up when supply is less, and demand is more.It follows the law of demand where as price increases, quantity demanded decreases and vice versa showing an inverse relationship between quantity demanded and price.

On 6 July 1923 it was decided that the flag was to consist of a red cloth with the state coat of arms of the Soviet Union in the centre. The unusual flag format 1:4 was selected. This flag was used however never to used very much and was only used officially for four months.

The third meeting of the Exekutive commitees of the Soviet Union changed the flag on 12 November 1923 into the more well-known version. The more common format 1:2 was selected. The state coat of arms was replaced by a gold sickle and hammer, and a red five-pointed star bordered in gold above them.

Minor changes to the shape of the hammer and sickle were made in 1955, and on 15 August 1980 the red was made a bright red. This design stayed the national flag until the break-up of the Soviet Union on 3 December 1991.

On 6 July 1923, the Central Executive Committee (CIK) started a project to create the coat of arms. It was finished on 22 September 1923. The constitution of the Soviet Union confirmed the new coat of arms officially in 1924. At first it had six red ribbons on the ears of wheat. The motto "Workers of the World, Unite!" was written on each ribbon, each in a different language. The first six languages were Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Georgian, Armenian, and Turko-Tatar.

Over the next several years, many more languages were added. In 1937 there were 11 languages, and in 1946, there were 16. In 1956 the Finnish text from the coat of arms was removed, and up to the end of the Soviet Union there were 15 languages on the coat of arms.

Möglingen, Ludwigsburg and Remseck at the Neckar (all district Ludwigsburg) as well as Stuttgart (urban area)

The municipality of Kornwestheim consists of the town centre and Pattonville. The latter became a part of Kornwestheim only at the beginning of the 1990s, having belonged to the Gemarkung Aldingen initially. The settlement was established in 1954 by the US army. After their departure a Company bought the area from the Federal Republic of Germany and divided it between the towns of Kornwestheim and Remseck am Neckar. Pattonville has since been converted from a military to a civilian settlement. 

The tower of Kornwestheim's town hall was built in the year 1935 by the architect Paul Bonatz. It serves not only as town hall tower, but also as water tower with a container of 800 cubic meters volumes and as clock tower.

Karate

Karate is a form of fighting (called a martial art) which originated in Okinawa, an island in Japan. Karate uses all parts of the human body as a weapon such as the hand, fist, elbow, leg and knee. 

Gichin Funakoshi, a school teacher from the Japanese island of Okinawa, introduced Karate to mainland Japan in the early 1900s. Traditional karate is different from boxing, wrestling and kickboxing: in karate, there is just as much importance on the strength of the mind and good manners as there is on strength of the body.

Karate became more known around the world because of Karate movies in the 1960s and 1970s. Now people all over the world learn Karate.

After World War II, Karate also became popular in Korea, where it was known under the name "tangsudo". The full name of Karate is "Karate-do" which means "the way of the empty hand" in English. A person who does Karate is called a "Karateka". There are many different styles of Karate including Shotokan, Wado ryu, Goju ryu and Kyokushinkai. 

Famous Karateka include: Gichin Funakoshi, his cousin Kenneth Funakoshi, Shigeru Egami, Masutatsu Oyama, Chuck Norris and Fumio Demura.

When people practice Karate, they wear special clothes called a karategi. The karategi is made up of a white jacket and white pants. People who practice Karate also wear a coloured belt, which tells other people the rank you have in karate not how good you are. Two people wearing different colored belts means not how long they have been doing karate but they have tested and know more about karate. 

Different schools of Karate have different colours of belts for their ranks. You cannot know precisely how good they are without either asking them or knowing how their school arranges the belt colours in ranks. Usually the black belt is for the students who try very hard to be the best that they can be for a long time. 

Some schools have several degrees of black belts. They show this by having a white stripe, called a Dan, on the one end of the belt, for the black belt degree the person has. For instance a "3 Dan black belt" would have 3 white stripes on his black belt and would be higher ranked than a "1 Dan black belt".

Kickboxing

Kickboxing is a descriptive term for martial arts that, while similar to boxing, use the feet just like the hands to hit. Kickboxing can be practiced for general health, or as the fight sport. The word kickboxing represents a set of disciplines or sports of combat that use the feet and the fists. Especially, kickboxing is one of the disciplines of "Boxe pieds-poings" which was developed at first by the Japaneses and afterwards by the North Americans. There are different kinds of kick boxing, most popular form is one where kicks are allowed towards head & torso only.

In the middle of the years 1960, the Japanese Kurosaki, who trained in Kyokushinkai Karate, travelled to Thailand discovering Thai boxing. In his returning to the Japan decided to combine his techniques of karate with that of Thai boxing, removing elbow strikes (the Americans also removed knee strikes), so a new sport called "kickboxing" was born. 

Among the non-Japaneses that gained more successes, a special consideration should be given to Frenchman Christian Guillaume who in 1969 gained four victories and two draws; and American Benny "The Jet" Urquidez who in 1977 defeated Tatsuyuki Suzuki in four rounds. 

In 1973 Urquidez and Howard Hanson created the W.K.A. (World Karate Association), changing years after the "K" de karate for that of Kick-Boxing. 

The more known champions are Rob Kaman, Benny Urquidez, Dennis Alexio, Ernesto Hoost, and Marek Piotrowski. 

The punches and kicks are permitted for above the waist, the sweepings and the "low kicks" (kicks to the thigh) also are permitted. 

The "amateur" combats take place in three rounds, and the professional ones last five rounds; 10 in championships of Europe and 12 in the championships of the world, with a one-minute half-time (break) between rounds. 

The kicks to the thigh ("low kick") usually decide about the difference in the combats. 

Pants (long or short), boxing gloves and protectors for the teeth and for the genitals; in the female combats, women should also wear protector of chest and boots (not required in the professional combats).

Hoyerswerda

Hoyerswerda (Upper Sorbian: Wojerecy, Lower Sorbian: Wórjejce) is a city in the north of the Saxonian Upper Lusatia, lying north east of Cottbus and from Dresden, (Saxony). It is in the Sorbian settlement area. The city is one of the six centers of the Free State of Saxony and is a member of the Euroregion Neisse, a group which helps international trade and cooperation in the area.

The first time Hoyerswerda was mentioned in a document was in 1268. In the year 1371 the emperor Karl IV. made it a market place. The people were allowed to choose their own council . This right was given to them by "Baron von Duba". In the year 1705 the Elector of Saxony August the Strong gave Hoyerswerda to Katharina of Teschen. She was an important person in the small town. She helped the town to develop its trade and handicraft.

In 1759, during the Seven-Years War between Prussia and Saxony, there was a fight between Austrian and Prussian troops which is called: the Battle of Hoyerswerda.

After the Congress of Vienna in the year 1815 Hoyerswerda was given to Prussia. In 1825 it became part of Selesia. In 1873 the railway came to Hoyerswerda – opening up access to other parts of the country. This brought economic prosperity. A large repair workshop was built. In 1912 the Sorbians formed an organization called "Domowina" in Hoyerswerda. In the year 1945 a lot of Hoyerswerda was destroyed because it was a military stronghold of the German army. The invading troops of the Red Army set parts of the city on fire.

In 1955 the brown coal industry developed close to the city. Today this industry is partly in Brandenburg. Houses were built here for the families of the people working in the industry. From 1957 the need of for housing increased even more. The first large blocks of flats were built. Altogether ten residential complexes were built creating housing for tens of thousands of people. In the year 1981 the number of inhabitants of the city reached its maximum of 71.124. At this time Hoyerswerda had the highest birth rate in the GDR. In 1990 the former Prussian province of Lower Saxony decided by popular vote to go over to the Free State Saxony.

In 1991 rioting took place in Hoyerswerda outside a hostel for foreign asylum-seekers. People used the word "Ausländerfrei" ("foreigner-free"). This word was voted the "Unwort" (politically incorrect word) of 1991.
Since the fall of the Iron Curtain many people have left the town. Since the number of inhabitants continued to decrease after 1999, many iron buildings were pulled down. From 1 January 2008 Hoyerswerda will no longer be able to rule itself as there will be changes to the administration of Saxony, and Hoyerswerda will become part of a district (Kreis) instead of being a kreisfreie Stadt.

The Palace of Soviets (Russian: Dvorjez Sovjetov / Дворец Советов) was a building project planned by the government of the Soviet Union. A contest was held for the architectural design of the building from 1931 until 1933. Construction was started on the building in 1937, but was stopped in 1941 because of World War II. The building was going to be used as a administrative center and meeting place. It was to be built in Moscow near the Kremlin. The palace would have had a height of 415m. This would have made it the largest building of the world at that time.

The design of the building was created by the architect Boris Iofan. During its design, there were many changes to how it would look and to the location of the palace in Moscow.

<doc id="37094" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37094" title="Battle of the Somme">
Battle of the Somme

The Battle of the Somme was a big battle that happened during World War I. It started on 1 July 1916 and finished, without any noticeable change in positions, on 18 November 1916. The Somme is a river in northern France. The "Battle of the Somme" took place around the river. On the first day, there were about 60,000 casualties in the British force and 20,000 of those died. More than one million people died, were wounded or went missing, in the battle. Today, it is considered the worst battle of World War I, especially by Great Britain. In the minds of the French and the Germans, the Battle of Verdun (which was very similar) is considered to be the worst. In total between 300,000 German, British Empire and French soldiers were killed in the Battle of the Somme. This is very similar to the casulties of the Battle of Verdun.

The first day on the Somme was the bloodiest day in British military history. For five days before 1 July, the British army shot non-stop at the German trenches, to destroy their trenches and the barbed wire that was in front of them. Thinking that most of the German defense was destroyed, at 7:30 am on the morning of 1 July, the British generals told all of the British soldiers to get out of their trenches and walk slowly over to the German trenches. They thought that it would be safe to do this, but they were very wrong. It was clear weather, which was perfect for the Germans because they could see everything the British and French were doing, and it meant the British and French could not surprise the soldiers. As the British soldiers climbed out of their trenches the German soldiers started to shoot them. The soldiers had to do what they were told and keep walking over to the German trenches, even though they were walking straight into bullets. This is why so many soldiers died. Many of the soldier's bodies lay in the mud for weeks after they had been killed because it was too dangerous for other soldiers to go and get them. 1.73 million bombs were dropped on the German trenches and 1/3 of them did not work. This was because many of the artillery and bombs were not made properly.

Many different types of artillery were used during the Battle of the Somme. They were quite different to the weapons used in conflict today. We have a lot more technology available today and it is easier to find the weak spots of the enemy bases. The main weapons used were bolt-action rifles, machine guns, tanks, poison gas, howitzers and mines.

The Germans used poisonous gases as weapons first. They used chlorine gas to begin with but it gave off a strong smell and was green so it could be easily seen by the enemy. It also blew back on the Germans when they used it. They began to wear dampened material over their mouths and noses. It was more effective if they used urine (wee) instead of water! The British soldiers were given cotton pads and respirators. Death from chlorine gas was very painful and you suffocated after suffering from a burning pain in your chest. The Germans then started to use a different gas called phosgene which they mixed with the chlorine. Phosgene was more deadly than chlorine and was colourless and smelled like mouldy hay but it took 24 hours to work.

Rifles were used by the soldiers in the trenches. The main type of rifle that they used was the bolt-action rifle which could fire 15 rounds per minute and could kill a person 1.4 kilometres away. This type of rifle was invented by a Scottish man called James Paris Lee, in America. The bolt-action rifle had a metal box where the cartridges were put on top of a spring. As the bolt opened, the spring forced the cartridges up against a stop and the bolt pushed the top cartridge into the chamber as it closed. After the rifle was fired, the opening of the bolt ejected the empty cartridge case and the return stroke loaded a fresh round. The cases held 3, 5 or 6 cartridges each.

The machine guns used were very big and needed at least 4 men to work them. They had to be put on a very flat surface. They had the power of 100 rifles and the infantry men hated the machine gunners. If a machine gunner was caught, he was more likely to be killed. Larger field guns needed up to 12 men to operate them. They fired shells which exploded when they hit.

The first tank was called ‘Little Willie’ and it had a crew of 3 men. The maximum speed that it could travel was 3 mph and it was not able to cross the trenches. The first tank battle, Flers-Courcelette named after the two villages that were the objectives for the attack, started on 15 September 1916. Out of the 49 tanks that should have been there only 36 arrived. This was the first time that tanks had been used in World War I but because they were only armed lightly and the mechanics of them often went wrong they did not make a great impact. However, casualties were low in the tank crews.

Mines are a way to blow up the enemy and really shock the enemy. Anti-infantry land-mines have been in use since the invention of gun-powder and were used in the defence of breaches of fortresses in the 18th and 19th century (the British assault on the breach at Badajoz suffered many casualties from mines). However these were activated remotely by a defender lighting a very fast burning fuse at the appropriate moment. The British used 10 mines on the first morning of the Battle of Somme to startle and damage the German front line. The holes left by the mines were used by the Germans for machine guns though.

There was a lot of disease in the trenches. The toilets in the trenches were mainly buckets and holes. This meant that diseases like dysentery spread very quickly. Dysentery causes stomach pains and diarrhoea and sometimes sickness. The body can become very dehydrated which can cause you to die. The water supply in the trenches was not very good. They added chloride of lime to purify the dirty water that the men collected from the shell holes but the soldiers did not like the taste of the chloride of lime – it tasted a bit like our swimming pool water! 

The soldiers in the trenches suffered from lice. One man described them as, "pale fawn in colour, and they left blotchy red bite marks all over the body.” Another soldier said, "The things lay in the seams of trousers, in the deep furrows of long thick woolly pants, and seemed impregnable in their deep entrenchment. A lighted candle applied where they were thickest made them pop like Chinese crackers. After a session of this, my face would be covered with small blood spots from extra big fellows which had popped too vigorously." As well as causing lots of scratching, lice also carried disease. This was known as pyrrexhia or trench fever. The first symptoms were shooting pains in the legs and this was followed by a very high fever. The disease did not kill the soldiers but it did stop them from fighting.
Trench Foot was an infection caused by standing in the wet for a long time and not being able to dry your shoes and socks out. Your feet would go numb at first and then turn red or blue, and if you got gangrene you may have to have your foot amputated. Brigadier-General Frank Percy Crozier argued that: “The fight against the condition known as trench-feet had been incessant and an uphill game." The only way to get rid of trench foot was to dry your feet and change your socks several times a day.

Lots of men injured in the trenches had parts of their bodies amputated. This was from being wounded or having them blown off by mines or shells.

The rats were there because there were loads of corpses of dead people. One soldier claimed they were as big as cats his name was Harry Patch. Another one said “The rats were huge. They were so big they would eat a wounded man if he couldn't defend himself." The rats were found on corpses and they went for the eyes first then they burrowed into the corpse and ate the insides of the corpse.

The area between the two sides was called No Man’s Land and it was very dangerous because there was lots of barbed wire and shell-holes and no man’s land is usually a sea of mud. Also the soldiers that went over the top were easy targets for enemy machine gunners. Over the whole battle the whole of the Allies lost about 600,000 men but the Germans lost just as many.

The Prince of Wales served on the Somme as a Staff Officer. Although genuinely disappointed not to be involved in the fighting, the understanding his service gave him of ordinary men and the rest admiration he earned from them, strongly influenced the rest of his life both as Prince of Wales

Today, the place where the Battle of the Somme took place has lots of cemeteries, war memorials and museums for people to visit and pay their respects.

Ballade

A ballade is a medieval French verse or song which tells a story. Like the rondeau and the virelai it was very popular in 14th and 15th century France. All these three songs were originally dances. Famous composers like Guillaume de Machaut wrote ballades. 

Ballade verses often had three stanzas which had the same metre and rhyme scheme, and the last line was often the same. They might end with an envoi which meant that it was addressing a king or prince. The great English poet Geoffrey Chaucer wrote ballades.

Ballade (musical form)

"This article is about the instrumental ballade that was popular in the 19th century.
For the medieval French ballade see Ballade".

A ballade is a piece of music, usually for piano. It has several tunes, and one can easily imagine that it is telling a story (a ballade is a medieval French song which tells a story).

The first composer who used the title “ballade” for his piano pieces was Frédéric Chopin. He wrote four ballades. They are quite free in form. Chopin does not tell us about any particular story he had in mind. Perhaps they are just musical stories. They are four of his finest works.

Later on other composers also wrote ballades: César Franck and Franz Liszt in particular. Johannes Brahms wrote ballades for piano which are quite like songs in their form. Edvard Grieg wrote a ballade which was based on a Norwegian song.

Gabriel Fauré wrote a ballade for piano and orchestra. Some composers wrote ballades for orchestra, but they are really like short symphonic poems.

For the rights of the use of a name of the stadium Borussia Dortmund releases estimated 20 million euro with optimal sporty success. The contract over renaming between Borussia Dortmund and the signal Iduna group of insurance applies up to the season 2010/2011. The Dortmunder fan scene is divided opinion over this step, since he offers on the one hand the financial safety device, but on the other hand a tradition break represents.

The district agency city center west decided at the beginning of the year 2006 to call a road in stadium proximity at the "Westfalenstadion". The association rated this decision as unsensibel opposite the sponsor, while many BVB fans and Dortmunder were pleased that the steeped in tradition name remained now with the road.

Coat of Arms of Germany

The coat of arms of Germany (German Wappen Deutschlands) is a symbol of Germany; the coat of arms feature an eagle. The coat of arms are similar to those of the flag of Germany (black, red and gold ). It is the oldest existing state symbol in Europe and is one of the oldest insignia in the world. Its history as an emblem is far longer, however. To the Germanic tribes the eagle was the bird of the god Odin, and by the Romans, too, it was revered as the symbol of the supreme god, of the emperor and of invincibility. From there and through its religious significance in Christendom it came to be incorporated into medieval symbolism.

The Mazurka is very similar to the Kujawiak which is a dance from another district near Warsaw.

The Mazurka is a lively dance in 3/4 metre. It has lots of dotted rhythms and the fourth note of the scale is often sharpened. The dancers often click their heels on the 2nd or 3rd beat of the bar. The speed is not always fast, it can be slow, but it is a wilder dance than the waltz which is also in 3/4 time and had become very popular as a ballroom dance.

The composer Frédéric Chopin wrote more than 50 mazurkas for the piano. Chopin really shows his genius in these pieces. They are very beautiful and there is a lot of variety and interest in them. Many of them are not all that difficult to play. Some of them have very chromatic bits in them.

There were other classical composers who wrote Mazurkas, but none of them are as good as those of Chopin. Some Russian composers like Glinka and Tchaikovsky wrote several mazurkas. It was danced a lot in Russia in the 19th century and it is mentioned a lot in Russian novels. In the 20th century Karol Szymanowski wrote several mazurkas.

British Airways

British Airways plc (sometimes known as just "BA") is the UK's largest airline. It was formed when the UK's two government owned airlines, the British Oversea Airways Corporation and British European Airways were joined together. It operates domestic flights within the UK as well as international flights to Europe and the rest of the world. It was formed from a group of other UK airlines joining together to make a big one: British Airways (BA). BA have one of the biggest fleet of aircraft in the world operating Boeing 737, 747, 757, 767 and 777 aircraft as well as Airbus A320 family planes and regional planes such as the Embraer ERJ-145. For a time during the 1990s BA had a World Tails scheme on their planes, each tail was painted in a design to symbolise a country of the world; Botswana, Germany, Sweden and Scotland were countries represented but many more were as well.

British Airways has its own terminal at Heathrow Airport in London, England Terminal 5 or T5. It was opened on 14 March 2008 by the UK monarch Queen Elizabeth II, at a cost of £4.3 billion to build ( $6.2 billion )set between two of Heathrows runways 27L/09R and 27R/09L. covering a 260 hectare site.

British Airways has sole use of T5, other airlines that fly to or from Heathrow use one of the other four terminai. At the moment, not all British Airways' flights go to/from T5. Flights to Bangkok in Thailand, Singapore and Sydney in Australia depart from Terminal 4. British Airways intend to move these routes to Terminal 5.

British Airways has a fleet of 238 planes: 33 Airbus A319s, 30 Airbus A320s, 11 Airbus A321s, 33 Boeing 737s, 57 Boeing 747 Jumbo Jets, 11 Boeing 757s, 21 Boeing 767s and 24 Boeing 777s. plus 67 aeroplanes on order. 2 Airbus A318s, 19 Airbus A320s, 12 Airbus A380 "Super Jumbos", 10 Boeing 777s and 24 Boeing 787 "Dreamliners".

British Airways also owns two other smaller airlines called BA CityFlier and OpenSkies, which run different services than the large airline.

BA CityFlier runs flights from London City Airport to other major cities in the UK (like Edinburgh and Glasgow) and the rest of Europe (like Nice in France, Dublin in Ireland, Frankfurt in Germany, Madrid in Spain and Zurich in Switzerland). It is a fairly new airline that only started running in March 2007. It is also very small, only running 12 British Aerospace Avroliners.

OpenSkies in an even smaller airline with only two aircraft, old Boeing 757s from the British Airways collection. At the moment, it only flies to/from Amsterdam in The Netherlands, Paris in France and New York in the USA. The two Boeing 757s has only 40 Premium Economy seats and 24 Business Class seats with no Economy Class seats.

Oneworld is a partnership between 9 airlines: American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, Iberia, Japan Airlines, LAN, Malev Hungarian Airlines, Qantas, Royal Jordanian Airlines and British Airways. It also includes these airlines' partners such as BA CityFlier (but OpenSkies is not part of oneworld). 

Being part of oneworld means that the airlines sell their own tickets as well as other members, (so for example, British Airways would sell tickets for American Airlines flights). This is good for the airlines because the customers like getting their tickets in one place and it lets the airlines use flights that they wouldn't normally have. Also, oneworld has a "frequent flyer" scheme, where all the member airlines' schemes can be turned into this oneworld scheme which is recognised across all the member airlines. The three levels are Oneworld Ruby (lowest), Oneworld Sapphire (middle) and Oneworld Emerald (highest). It is up to the airlines to decide what levels are the same as their own levels.

G8

The Group of Eight (G8) is a group made up of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia the United Kingdom and the United States. The European Commission is also represented in the committee. The group has conferences or meetings throughout the year, it researches policies, and has a summit meeting once a year. The heads of government of each G8 country attend the summit meeting.

Each year a different country takes over the presidency of the group for the duration of the year. The country that holds the presidency sets the agenda for the year and hosts the summit for that year. 

The G8 is not considered an international organization because it does not have administrative structure. This means that besides the president, there are no official titles for the members, they are all considered equal. Their meetings are not formal. The goal is to talk about global topics and problems in a relaxed manner. 

There are many global problems and issues that can be discussed at meetings. Some common topics of discussion include: health, law enforcement, labor, economic and social development, energy, environment, foreign affairs, justice, terrorism, and trade.

The member country holding the G8 presidency is responsible for organizing and hosting the year's summit. It's usually held for three days in the middle of the year. The first summit meeting was held in November of 1975 in France. 

The 8 countries that make up the G8 represent about 14% of the people in the world but produce over 65% of the world's economic output measured by gross domestic product (GDP).

Students for a Democratic Society

The Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) was a student activist movement in the United States in the 1960s (1960 to 1969).

A new SDS group was also begun in 2006. 

SDS held its first meeting in 1960 at Ann Arbor, Michigan. They had their first convention in 1962, and criticized the political system of the United States for not bringing international peace or fixing problems in society at home. It also called for non-violent civil disobedience so that student youth could bring forth a "participatory democracy."

In the school year 1962-1963, the President of SDS was Tom Hayden, who later became famous. There were nine chapters around the country with at most, about 1000 members. The national office (NO) in New York City had only a few desks, some broken chairs, a couple of filing cabinets, and a few typewriters. 

On October 1, 1964 the University of California, Berkeley exploded into the free speech movement. Led by a Friends of SNCC student activist named Mario Savio, more than three thousand students surrounded a police car where a student, arrested for setting up a card table against a ban by the University, was being taken away. The sit-down stopped the police car from moving for 36 hours. The demonstrations, meetings and strikes all but shut the university down. Hundreds of students were arrested. SDS leaders watched and learned from this lesson.

In February 1965, US President Lyndon Johnson made the war in Vietnam much bigger by bombing North Vietnam and putting ground troops right into fighting against the Viet Cong in the South. The draft became a very real issue in the lives of students in America. Campus chapters of SDS all over the country started to lead small, local demonstrations against the war and the NO became the main group that organized the March against the war in Washington DC on April 17. 

The first teach-in against the war was held in the University of Michigan. Soon hundreds more, all over the country, were held. The demonstration in Washington, DC attracted about 25,000 anti-war protesters and SDS became the leading student group against the war on most U.S. campuses.

The 1965 summer convention was held at Kewadin, Northern Michigan. and the National Office, moved from Manhattan to Chicago at about the same time. This brought more changes. 

"For the first time at an SDS meeting people smoked marijuana; Pancho Villa mustaches... blue workshirts, denim jackets, and boots were worn by both men and women. These were people generally raised outside of the East, many from the Midwest and Southwest

The Winter and Spring of 1967 saw more militancy of the protests at many campuses. Harassment by the authorities was also on the rise. The hippie movement really began to take hold. The 1967 convention spoke on the draft and resisting within the Army itself, and made a call for immediate withdrawal from Vietnam. Also, a women's liberation vote was passed for the first time.

That Fall saw more anti-war actions. The school year started with a large demonstration against the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wisconsin on October 17 for letting Dow recruiters on campus. Peaceful at first, the demonstrations turned to a sit-in that was violently broken up by the Madison police and riot squad, causing many injuries and arrests. A rally and a student strike then closed the university for several days. Demonstrations against the draft led by members of the Resistance, the War Resisters League, and SDS added fuel to the fire of resistance. After regular civil rights tactics of peaceful pickets, the Oakland California Stop the Draft Week ended in mass hit and run fights with the police. The huge (100,000 people) October 21 March on the Pentagon saw hundreds arrested and hurt. Night-time raids on draft offices began to spread.

In the spring of 1968, National SDS activists led an effort on the campuses called "Ten Days of Resistance" and local chapters held rallies, marches, sit-ins and teach-ins, ending in a one-day strike on April 26. About a million students stayed away from classes that day, the largest ever student strike in the history of the United States. It was mostly ignored by the New York City-based national media, which was more focused on the student shutdown of Columbia University in NYC, led by an inter-racial alliance of Columbia SDS chapter activists and Student Afro Society activists. Because of the Columbia Student Revolt, "SDS" became a household name in the United States for a few years; and membership in SDS chapters around the United States grew greatly during the 1968-69 school year. 

In the summer of 1969, the ninth SDS national convention was held at the Chicago Coliseum with some 2000 people attending. Many groups of the movement were there, even Communists, and set up their tables all around the edges of the hall, together with undercover spies, creating an air of excitement. 

Each of the delegates was given a paper saying "You don't need a Weatherman to know which way the wind blows" (a lyric from a Bob Dylan song, "Subterranean Homesick Blues"). This was written by a group who later became called the Weathermen and were involved in more violent protests. They took over by voting out another large group, the convention quickly fell apart, and so did SDS.

Beginning January 2006, there is a movement to start a new SDS. A small group of old SDS members joined with a Connecticut high school student to call for a new SDS fighting for civil rights and against war. Several chapters at various colleges were later started. On Martin Luther King Day of 2006, these chapters called for the first national convention since 1969 to be held in the summer of 2006 

Lately SDS has been in actions against war. The Pace University chapter of SDS protested against a speech by Bill Clinton held at the campus, causing the university to hand over two students to the United States Secret Service. When the school was going to kick these two students out of school, Pace SDS began a movement in March 2006 protesting the University's actions.

On March 19 2006, SDS marched in New York City against the war in Iraq. Seventeen people were arrested at the Times Square Recruitment Center, including several SDS members. Beginning in March and continuing into April and May, SDS chapters across the country participated in the Immigrant Rights Movement. On April 29 2006 SDS was in the march for Peace, Justice and Democracy in Manhattan, NY. As of July 2006, there are 150 SDS chapters located around the country and over 1000 members.

The newly formed SDS held its first national convention from August 4 to August 7, 2006 at the University of Chicago .

Postulate

A postulate (also sometimes called an axiom) is a statement that is agreed by everyone to be obvious and correct. This is useful for creating proofs in mathematics and science, and postulates are often the basic 
truth of a much larger theory or law.

Postulates themselves cannot be proven, but since they are usually obviously correct this is not a problem. Here is a good example of a postulate (given by Euclid in his studies about geometry).

Using this postulate and four others like it, Euclid brought a new understanding of geometry to the world, and many people think they are some of the most influential works in geometry even now.

There are also a few characteristics that all postulates should have.

Postulates are sometimes proved to be wrong after they have been known for a long time, but this is usually because something new has been discovered, and the original creator could not have known any better.

Influence

Influence is a force (or power) of change that comes from the outside of the person or thing that is influenced by it. It can be either planned by others on purpose, or an unplanned result of other events.

The adjective influential means "having much influence", so influential people or things have the power to change other people or things in some way. This word is often used to describe famous people. For example, Mohandas Gandhi was a very influential person, because the things he did and said changed many peoples lives, and many people believe he has even influenced the world.

Influence can be a bad thing too. For example, World War II influenced many people's lives, making it very difficult for them to live happily even after the war ended.

In law, "driving under the influence" (or DUI) usually means drunk driving; in other words, driving a car or other vehicle, which is a crime in most places.

Existence

Existence usually means "the state or fact of being", but there are many different views on the meaning of the word existence, and what it means to exist.

In English, existence is usually connected with the verb "to be".
The first sentence can be understood to say "I "exist" as a human", and simply speaking, this is probably true. The fourth sentence is more difficult to understand, because it can be understood to say "seven "exists" as the sum of four and three", but "seven" is not something that we can see or touch like a pen or a human.

The question "What is existence?" is a very important one for philosophers, and many people think Aristotle is the first human being to have thought seriously about the question.

<doc id="37256" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37256" title="Viennese waltz">
Viennese waltz

A Viennese waltz (Valse in French, Waltzer in German) is a music and dance which started in Vienna in the late 18th century. It is a ballroom dance in 3/4 time. It is the most famous of all dance forms. It became extremely popular during the 19th century, and is still danced today. Many famous composers wrote waltzes for piano or for orchestra. The rhythm of the waltz can be heard in lots of music, not just in pieces which are called a 'waltz'.

It is difficult to know exactly when the waltz started. The word comes from a German word “walzen” which means “to turn”. This is because the dancers turn around as they spin round the dance floor. There were German dances called Ländler which were simpler than the minuet and popular amongst ordinary people. The waltz developed from these dances. Schubert wrote many pieces called 'Ländler'. He also started to use the title 'Waltz'. Beethoven wrote 30 variations on a waltz that had been composed by Anton Diabelli.

Many people thought that the new dance was bad. This was because the dancing couples stood very close to one another and held one another in their arms (in the old minuet they held hands politely). Some people thought that it was very immoral and wrote angry letters to the newspapers saying that it was the end of civilised society. However, the waltz continued to be popular, and many dance halls were opened where people could waltz.

Composers became interested in the music of the waltz. Weber wrote a piece called 'Invitation to the Dance'. It has a main tune, then a set of variations, and at the end it comes back to the first tune. This form became a common way of writing a group of waltzes. Two composers in Vienna who became well-known for their waltzes were Joseph Lanner (1801–1843) and Johann Strauss (1804–1849), but the most famous of all was one of Strauss’s sons, also called Johann. Father and son are sometimes called Johann Strauss I and Johann Strauss II. The son is often called the 'King of the Waltz'. He wrote many waltzes which are still very popular today. On New Year’s Day the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra always give a concert which can be seen worldwide on television. They play lots of Strauss waltzes. The most famous one is called 'The Blue Danube' (German: 'An den schönen, blauen Donau').

In the Romantic period there was hardly a composer who was not influenced by the waltz. Chopin wrote about 15 piano waltzes, some of them are very fast, some are slower and more melancholy (sad). Brahms wrote 16 waltzes for piano duet. Many composers wrote waltzes in their operas, especially when the story is about people dancing at a party. The waltz was used a lot in operettas and ballets. Tchaikovsky wrote lots of waltz music in "Swan Lake", "Sleeping Beauty" and "The Nutcracker". Even Wagner, whose music is mostly very serious, wrote a waltz in his opera "Parsifal ". The rhythm of the waltz can be heard in a lot of orchestral music, e.g. Berlioz’s "Symphonie Fantastique". The great composers Anton Bruckner and Gustav Mahler preferred to use the old German Ländler in their symphonies.

Although the 19th century was the greatest period of the waltz, people continued to write and dance waltzes in the 20th century. In his opera "Der Rosenkavalier" (1909) the German composer Richard Strauss (no relation of Johann Strauss) the story is about Vienna in the old days, and so he uses the waltz to create the feeling of a time that was past. The waltz continued to be used in a lot of operettas, e.g. by Franz Léhar in "The Merry Widow ". The French composer Maurice Ravel wrote waltzes, including a brilliant piece for orchestra which was simply called "La Valse". Like Richard Strauss in "Der Rosenkavalier", Ravel was trying to describe the music of a century ago. "La Valse" is a piece which lasts about 20 minutes in one continuous movement. Lots of different instruments have a share in playing many different tunes.

The Viennese waltz is one of the five dances in international ballroom dance. It is the only one not invented in the early 20th century. It is the only one where the figures which competitors dance is restricted. Only nine figures are permitted by the World Dance Council.


Thus in this dance marking is influenced entirely by the actual dancing, and the value of choreography is almost nil.

Musk deer

Musk deer are a group of even-toed ungulate mammals. They form the family Moschidae. There are four species of musk deer, but they are all very similar. Musk deer are more primitive than true deer. 


Musk deer are about 90 centimeters long and about 60 centimeters high. They weigh about 10 kilograms. Musk deer mostly have a dark brown fur. Males have long upper canine teeth (called tusks), which can be up to 7 cm long. Musk deer do not have antlers. Male musk deer also have a musk gland. 

Musk deer live in Asia. They live in the mountains, mostly at heights of 2500 to 3500 meters. They live in dense forests. 

Musk deer are mostly active at night. Musk deer eat grass and moss; in winter they also eat twigs and lichen. 

Musk deer live alone. They only come together to mate. If two male musk deer meet, they fight, during which they can seriously hurt each other with their tusk-like teeth. 

The female gives birth to 1-2 babies. A musk deer baby has spots on its fur.

Male musk deer have a gland that produces musk. Musk is used to make perfumes and soap, and it is also used in Traditional Chinese medicine. One musk gland has about 25 to 30 grams of musk. Musk deer have been hunted and killed for its musk. Because of this, musk deer have become fewer and endangered. 
Anonther method is to catch a living musk deer, take its musk, and let it go free again. This method takes more time, so it is not used often. There are also musk deer farms.

<doc id="37331" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37331" title="Prelude">
Prelude

A prelude is a short piece of music for a musical instrument. It is called a prelude because it is supposed to be played before something else (Latin "pre"=before; "ludere"=to play).

Preludes started when lutenists (people who played the lute) improvised (which means playing while making it up as they were going along) a simple piece before a concert so that they could check whether their instrument was in tune. During the 16th century composers often wrote pieces which they called a “prelude” which was often a separate piece of music. These were often for lute, guitar or cittern. By the early 18th century the prelude was often a piece of music which was followed by a fugue. Johann Sebastian Bach wrote lots of pieces called “Prelude and Fugue”. Many of them are for organ. Forty-eight of them are from a collection called the "Welltempered Clavier". The first prelude in this collection is very famous. It sounds like an improvisation. It consists of gentle broken chords like a lutenist might play. (This is the piece that Charles Gounod later used for his "Ave Maria". Preludes were also pieces which were followed by a series of dance movements (a “suite”).

In the Classical period, not many composers wrote preludes. More preludes were composed in the 19th century (the period of Romanticism). Frédéric Chopin wrote a collection of short piano pieces which he called “Preludes”. They are not pieces to be followed by anything; they are just separate pieces of music. Chopin’s Preludes have some of his greatest music. Some are not too difficult to play, but others are very hard (virtuoso). Other composers like Alexander Scriabin, Karol Szymanowski, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Claude Debussy and Olivier Messiaen wrote similar preludes.

Some Romantic composers were inspired by the music of Bach and they started writing Preludes and Fugues for organ. Felix Mendelssohn, Franz Liszt and Max Reger wrote some. In the 20th century Dmitri Shostakovich wrote a collection of Preludes and Fugues for piano.

There are also examples of 19th century composers who wrote short pieces for orchestra called “Preludes”. Sometimes, they wrote a short orchestral introduction to an opera which they called Prelude (or German: “Vorspiel”) instead of the usual word “overture”.

The polonaise is a Polish dance. It started as a folk dance and then became popular among the Polish nobility. It is in 3/4 time and feels quite important in character. In the courts of the aristocracy musicians would often play a polonaise from the gallery while the people danced below in the reception hall.

Polish culture was very popular in Europe in the 1830s and so the polonaise became known in other countries. composers started to write polonaises for the piano. Pieces called "Polonaise" had already been composed by Bach, Handel, François Couperin and others, but it was Frédéric Chopin who in the 19th century wrote several Polonaise for piano which became really famous. Most of them are very hard to play, especially the famous "Polonaise in A flat op.53". They really sound very Polish.

Several Russian composers wrote polonaises to give a Polish atmosphere, e.g. Tchaikovsky in his ballet "Sleeping Beauty " and in his opera "Eugene Onegin ".

Malcolm Arnold

Sir Malcolm Arnold (born Northampton, 21 Oct 1921; died 23 September 2006) was an English composer. He is famous for writing symphonies, concertos and film music. People disagree about whether he is one of the really great composers, or just a very skilled musician. His music is often very tuneful, sometimes it is sentimental. He could write music very quickly. His famous music for the film "The Bridge on the River Kwai" was composed in ten days.

In 1938 Malcolm Arnold went to the Royal College of Music to study composition with Gordon Jacob. He started his career as a trumpeter with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, later becoming principal trumpet. By the late 1940s he was concentrating on his composing career.

Arnold was composing at a time when many composers were writing music which was quite atonal which made it hard to understand, but Arnold’s music is tonal and there are many tunes which are easy to remember. He wrote nine symphonies and several concertos for different instruments, even unusual instruments like the harmonica. Some of his best orchestral works are the set of dances: "English Dances ", "Scottish Dances " and "Cornish Dances ". He also wrote 2 operas, 7 ballets and 2 string quartets. His overture "Tam O'Shanter" is very exciting. It tells in music the story in the poem by Robert Burns.

Arnold wrote music for 132 films. The most famous is "The Bridge on the River Kwai" (1957) for which he won an Oscar. He was the first British composer ever to have won this award. This film includes the famous "Colonel Bogey March". This march had been written many years earlier, but Arnold composed a countermelody to it. His original music for the film includes the famous River Kwai March (this is not the same as the "Colonel Bogey March"). Other films for which he wrote music include "The Belles of St Trinian's" (1954), "The Inn of the Sixth Happiness" (1958) and "Whistle Down the Wind" (1961). 

He was made a CBE in 1970 and was knighted in 1993.

Youth orchestras and amateur orchestras enjoy playing his works because they are an exciting mixture of classical, jazz, popular and folk music, and are not too difficult to play.

Arnold’s health was often very poor. At times he fought with alcoholism and depression, and in his later years with dementia. He had moved to Dublin in 1972, but moved back to England in 1984 and settled in Attleborough, Norfolk. His full-time carer Anthony Day helped him a lot during his final years.

Arnold died from a chest infection in September 2006.

Linkin Park

Linkin Park is an American rock band from Aguora Hills, California. They started making music in 1996 and have sold more than 50,000,000 albums all over the world. Since then, they have also won two Grammys. When they released their first album, "Hybrid Theory", they became popular. Their next album, "Meteora", made them even more popular in 2003. Linkin Park changed their sound in their latest album, "Minutes to Midnight", released in 2007. The album's style was very different from their previous work. "Minutes to Midnight" had the third best sales during its first week out of all releases that year. The band has sold over 50 million copies worldwide.

The band was first made up of three friends from Aguora High School, and was named Xero. The first members were Mike Shinoda, Brad Delson, and Rob Bourdon. After high school, they started to get serious and added Joe Hahn and Dave "Phoenix" Farrell. When they could not get a contract from a major music company, Mark Wakefield quit. Dave Farrell also quit to be in another band, Tasty Snax, for awhile.

After a bit of time, Xero added Chester Bennington, who was referred by Jeff Blue, the vice-president of Zomba Music. They soon changed their name to Hybrid Theory. They still could not get a contract. They asked Jeff Blue, now vice-president of Warner Bros. Records, to help. In 1999, they finally got a contract and were renamed Linkin Park. In 2000, the next year, they released "Hybrid Theory."

Linkin Park released "Hybrid Theory" on October 24, 2000. It was the result of over four years of work. It was edited by Don Gilmore. It sold 4.8 million copies in the first year, most of these were in 2001. The singles of the album are "One Step Closer", "Crawling", "Papercut" and "In the End" which made the band famous. This album led them to be nominated for three Grammy awards and win one. The album had made Linkin Park very popular.

They performed on many popular tours like Ozzfest. They also made their own tour, Projekt Revolution, that included other artists like Cypress Hill. In one year, they performed at 320 concerts. Then, Dave Farell rejoined Linkin Park. They then began working on "Reanimation", an album that had remixes of songs from "Hybrid Theory" and "Hybrid Theory EP". It was released on July 30, 2002. It became very successful. The album has only one single, "Pts.OF.Athrty".

Linkin Park began working on their next album. The title was inspired by Meteora, a rocky place in Greece. On March 25, 2003 , they released "Meteora" and instantly became popular world-wide. In their first week, it sold 800,000 albums. By next year, it had sold 3 million copies. The album's singles are "Somewhere I Belong", "Faint", "Numb", "From the Inside", "Lying from You" and "Breaking the Habit".

"Meteora" got the band a lot of awards and honors. The band won MTV's awards for Best Rock Video for Somewhere I Belong. The Viewer's Choice Award for the song "Breaking the Habit" was also won by Linkin Park. Linkin Park also received a lot of awards at the 2004 Radio Music Awards, winning the Artist of the Year and Song of the Year. Even though Meteora was not as popular as "Hybrid Theory", it was the third best selling album in America during 2003. The band toured in early 2004 around the world. They did another Projekt Tour and many European tours during this time.

After "Meteora", the band did not work on another album for over three years. Instead, they kept on giving concerts, and did side projects. Chester Bennington appeared on "State of the Art" by DJ Lethal. He also sang in other songs by Dead by Sunrise, which was a side project band he had recently formed, although their album was not released yet. Mike Shinoda worked with Depeche Mode.

In 2004, Linkin Park started making another remix album with Jay-Z called "Collision Course" which began to be sold in November 2004. The album mashes-up songs from both Jay-Z and Linkin Park. The album's only single is "Numb/Encore", which was successful.

Mike also formed a new hip hop band called Fort Minor. With the help of Jay-Z, Fort Minor released their first album, "The Rising Tied". The album had four singles: "Petrified", "Believe Me", "Remember the Name" and "Where'd You Go". "Where'd You Go" made Fort Minor famous worldwide.

Linkin Park also did a lot of charity. Linkin Park played to raise money for Hurricane Dan in 2004 and Hurricane Matt in 2005. They also raised money for the 2004 Tsunami and made a charity called "Music for Relief." In the 2006 Grammys, they won the best rapped/sung song for Numb/Encore.

In 2006, Linkin Park began writing new songs for their third studio album, "Minutes to Midnight". Even though they said it would be done in 2006, they decided they could not finish it until 2007. They made thirty to fifty songs in August 2006. Then, Warner Bros. Music said that they would start selling it on May 15, 2007. After 14 months, they made it better by taking five songs out. When they first sold it, it sold 600,000 in its first week. The albums's singles are "What I've Done", "Bleed It Out", "Shadow of the Day", "Given Up" and "Leave Out All the Rest". The band also released two more albums in 2008: "Road to Revolution: Live at Milton Keynes", the band's second live album, and "Songs From the Underground", a compilation of previously unreleased songs. The band also made a single with Busta Rhymes called "We Made It".

2009 was a very busy year for the band. They first released "New Divide", a single for the "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" movie, which was one of their biggest hits. Chester's side project, Dead by Sunrise, finally released their album "Out of Ashes". The album's singles are "Crawl Back In", "Let Down", "Inside Of Me" and "Too Late".

In 2010, Linkin Park released their fourth studio album, "A Thousand Suns".

Bamberg

Bamberg is a town in the region of Upper Franconia, Bavaria, and the seat of the district administration Bamberg. 

The town has about 70,000 inhabitants. Bamberg is an university city and administrative city. Its Lord Mayor is Andreas Starke (SPD). Beside being a modern regional centre, the city also has a cultural and historical side.

Bamberg is a famous town because it has many buildings which are very old. The basic structure of the town remained untouched through the centuries. Unlike most other German towns (such as Nürnberg), it was little damaged in World War II. Only 4.6% was totally ruined. The town centre is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Bamberg is like Rome because it is built on seven hills, each one with a church at the top. The cathedral (Dom) is on the main hill. For hundreds of years the prince-bishops of the cathedral ruled over the land. This continued until the beginning of the 19th century after which they just continued in their religious function as archbishops. 

The town centre below is built by the banks of the river Regnitz which splits into two parts. The left arm of the river is where the old town centre lies. The right arm is the Main-Danube canal (Main-Donau-Kanal)which allows big ships to travel from the river Main to the Danube.

Many tourists visit the beautiful city of Bamberg. A good place to start a walk round the town is by the statue of Neptune in the pedestrian precinct. The Bambergers call this statue Gabelmann because Neptune is holding his three-pronged fork (“Gabel”). It is a favourite meeting place for people. 

The area here is called the Grüner Markt (Green Market). This place became centre of the bourgeois settlement which developed around it. Very close by is a big square called Maximiliansplatz. It is very lively here on market days. There are many things for sale, and people eat the traditional sausages which are cooked at the sausage stall, and drink Bamberg beer. When the square is empty it looks very big. There used to be a church at the north-west end, but it was destroyed in 1806 at the time when the archbishops lost their political power. The patronage of St. Martin was taken over by the former Jesuit church which was built by the architect Georg Dientzenhofer until 1693, situated at the Green Market.

The names of nearby streets tell a lot about the town history. There is the Fischstrasse (Fish Street) where fishermen used to live. This leads down to the left arm of the river Regnitz where one can see the place where the boats used to stop to load and unload their goods. The small building by the is the old slaughterhouse. The left arm itself splits for a short while because the Old Canal (Alter Kanal) runs along the east side, making a large island on which there are some very old buildings. The oldest buildings, dating from the 16th century, were built by tanners who became quite rich through their trade of making leather.

Bamberg’s Old Town Hall was built in the middle of the river Regnitz. It is not on the island, but it is was built by the people who drove huge beams of wood into the riverbed. Their town hall therefore stood between the south-west bank where the bishops ruled and the north-east bank where the ordinary tradespeople lived. 

The Old Town Hall is the most-often photographed building of Bamberg. There are two bridges here for pedestrians: the Upper and Lower Bridge. The ancient Lower Bridge passes through the archway of the town hall. On one side there are beautiful Baroque paintings. On the other side one can still see the medieval black-and-white walls. This side was also plastered over with paintings in the Baroque times, but when a bridge nearby was blown up in World War II the plaster fell off, so it is now kept with the original medieval walls showing.

A steep climb up a cobbled street takes us to the Cathedral Square (Domplatz) which is extremely beautiful. All the buildings around the square are made from the local sandstone, although they date from different periods. Bamberg Cathedral (called Kaiserdom i.e. Emperor Cathedral) shows Romanesque and Gothic architecture. 

Everyone should have seen the world-famed Rider or Bamberg horseman inside and many other medieval sandstone figures as well. The Ratsstube is built in the Renaissance style. The Alte Hofhaltung is medieval. It is a 15th century courtyard with a long row of two-storey buildings with a wooden gallery. Across the street from there is the New Residence (Neue Residenz) which is a Baroque palace. A walk through here leads into the famous Rose Garden (Rosengarten). From here one can see Abbey Church of St Michael at the very top of the hill. Just below, going back towards the river, is the Sandstrasse famous for its pubs and night life.

Bamberg is home to the world-famous Bamberger Symphoniker who perform in a new concert hall a short distance from the town centre. There are also many other music groups, including the Musica Canterey Bamberg who perform old music in some of the historical buildings. The 19th century German writer E.T.A.Hoffmann lived in Bamberg. There is a new theatre in the town centre which is named after him.

Bamberg has a railway station from where one can travel to other large towns such as Würzburg, Munich, Nuremberg, Leipzig, Berlin and Hamburg as well as to other towns in eastern Upper Franconia such as Forchheim, Lichtenfels, Coburg, and Kronach.

Bamberg is served by Bamberg-Breitenau Airfield. At "Flugplatz Bamberg-Breitenau" are operating mostly public aircraft, although it is classificated as a military airport (IATA-Code: ZCD, ICAO-Code: ETEJ). 
It is also possible to charter public flights to and from this airport. 
Most international tourists who travel by plane arrive at Frankfurt International Airport or Munich Airport. The nearest bigger airport is Nuremberg Airport which can be reached within half an hour by car or one hour by train.
Bamberg has a problem with road traffic because, although there is a bypass, it cannot go all the way round the town because of the hills. Traffic is not allowed in many streets in the town centre. There is no parking allowed in the beautiful Domplatz except on Sundays.

Because Bamberg is on a river, transport by boat has always been important. The Rhine-Main-Danube Canal begins near Bamberg. It was completed in 1992 and makes it possible for boats to travel from the North Sea to the Black Sea.

In the town itself many people travel by bus. There is also a Park-and-Ride system.

There is a University in Bamberg. About 9000 students study there. The university is spread over lots of buildings in the town centre. It is a good way to make use of many of the large, historical buildings.

There are good schools in Bamberg including 8 Gymnasien. Pupils often choose which one to go to according to the subjects they are good at, because each school is strong in a particular area: science, music, language etc.



Bamberg is famous for its beer. There are ten breweries in the town, of which the most famous is Schlenkerla which makes smoked beer (Rauchbier).

The ten breweries are:

Diving is a form of movement downwards, either from air to ground or to water. Diving is also a sport. Diving is often done from a springboard or an elevated platform.

There are six different types of dives, and four different body positions that a person can use when diving. 

There are six different types of dives. Four of the types depend on whether the diver is facing towards the water or away from the water, and if they rotate towards or away from the water. The other two dives can be a part of the first four. For example, a diver can do a "inward twisting" or a "forward armstand" dive. The basic types of dives are:

The four different body positions are tuck, pike, straight and free.

Pulsar

<onlyinclude>

Pulsars are neutron stars that turn quickly and produce electromagnetic radiation that can be received in the form of radio waves. The strength of radiation changes according to a regular period of time, which is thought to match to the period of time in which the star turns. Pulsars also show a so-called lighthouse effect, which occurs when the light and other radiation from a pulsar are only seen at certain periods of time and not all of the time. Werner Becker of the Max-Planck-Institut für extraterrestrische Physik recently said,

The first pulsar was discovered in 1967, by w:en:Jocelyn Bell Burnell and w:en:Antony Hewish of the w:en:University of Cambridge, UK. At first, they did not understand why pulsars have a regular change in the strength of radiation, they called their discovery LGM-1, for "w:en:little green men"; their pulsar was later called w:en:CP 1919, and is now known by a number of names including PSR 1919+21. The word "pulsar" is short for "pulsating star", and was first seen written in 1968:

w:en:Astrophysicist w:en:Peter A. Sturrock writes that "when the first regular radio signals from pulsars were discovered, the Cambridge scientists seriously considered that they might have come from an w:en:extraterrestrial civilization. They debated this possibility and decided that, if this proved to be correct, they could not make an announcement without checking with higher authorities. There was even some discussion about whether it might be in the best interests of mankind to destroy the evidence and forget it!" (Sturrock, 154) That is to say, when pulsars were discovered, the scientists thought they might be signals from another planet, and the news might be dangerous to society.

CP 1919 produces radio wavelengths, but pulsars have later been found to produce radiation in the X-ray and/or w:en:gamma ray wavelengths. Hewish received the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics for this and similar work about radio astronomy.

Astronomers know that there are three different kinds of pulsars, named by the source of energy that powers the radiation:


Although all three kinds of objects are neutron stars, the things that they can be seen to do and the physics that causes this are very different. But there are some things that are similar. For example, w:en:X-ray pulsars are probably old rotation-powered pulsars that have already lost most of their energy, and can only be seen again after their binary companions expanded and matter from them started falling onto the neutron star. The process of accretion (matter falling onto the neutron star) can in turn give enough w:en:angular momentum energy to the neutron star to change it into a rotation-powered w:en:millisecond pulsar.

In June 2006, astronomer w:en:John Middleditch and his team at w:en:LANL was the first to forecast glitches (a sudden increase in the speed the star turns), with information that they received from the w:en:Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. They used information received from the pulsar w:en:PSR J0537-6910.

The study of pulsars has resulted in many uses in physics and astronomy. Major examples include the proof of w:en:gravitational radiation as forecasted by general relativity and the first proof of planets around other stars.

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords is a RPG video game set in the "Star Wars" expanded universe. It was developed by Obsidian Entertainment and was released in December 2004 on Xbox video game console and in February 2005 on PC.

Developed with the Odissey Engine, the game is set five years after KotOR, or 3.951 BBY. After the Jedi Civil War, Revan left the Galaxy to find something in the unknown areas, something that could be a threat to the Old Republic. There are less than 100 Jedi left in the Galaxy after the brutal war against Darth Malak. They are killed, one by one, by Sith assassins who attack from the shadows.

The player takes the role of the "Jedi Exile", believed to be the last Jedi or one of the last.
The player will meet several companions who will join him in his quest depending on his alignment and on the gender the player has chosen for his character. The Exile can eventually meet up to 11 characters: Kreia, Atton Rand, Bao-Dur, The Handmaiden (if the player is set to male), The Disciple (if the player is set to female), Mira (if the player is set to light-side), Hanharr (if the player is set to dark-side), T3-M4, HK-47, G0-T0, and Mandalore.

Paul Biya

Paul Biya is the President of Cameroon. He has been the country's president since 1982.

Biya was born on February 13, 1933 in the village of Mvomeka'a in Cameroon. At that time, the country was called French Cameroon. He studied at The Sorbonne and the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris in Paris, France. He graduated in 1961 with a bachelor's degree in public law and a diploma in international relations.

After graduating, Biya returned to Cameroon and worked in the government. In 1975, the President Ahmadou Ahidjo gave the job of Prime Minister to Biya. When President Ahidjo resigned on November 6, 1982, Biya became president of the country. Shortly afterwards, Ahidjo and Biya began feuding, and Ahidjo was forced to leave Cameroon.

Biya was elected as the President of Cameroon in 1984, 1988, 1992, 1997 and 2004, but other parties only have been allowed to enter the elections since 1992. The results many of these election results have been called fraudulent (achieved through unfair or illegal ways).

Many organizations, including Amnesty International, have criticized Biya's government for restricting the freedom of the people of Cameroon. These issues include control of the media (newspapers and radio and television stations) and violations of human rights . Biya's supporters point to the country's stability and high literacy rate.

1260s

The 1260s is a decade. It started on 1 January 1260 and ended on 31 December 1269.

Kublai Khan became the supreme leader (a title for their leader) of the Mongol Empire and moved his capital to Beijing. He was at war with the southern Chinese Song Dynasty. The Mongol Empire lost some of its battles. The first time it lost a battle with Kublai Khan as the leader was in Palestine when fighting the Mamluks of Egypt. The Empire also lost in the Caucasus. The Mamluks were led by their new sultan Baibars. The Mamluks were soon were more in control in the Middle East because they took control of a number of crusader states and also stopped the Mongol attacks from happening as much. The Empire of Nicaea took control of Constantinople and also the Latin Empire so it again became the Byzantine Empire.

In Europe there was problems in politics. Arguments about who was the owner of what land let to many wars in the continent. In England there was the Second Barons' War. This was a civil war between the aristocracy who did not like how the King named Henry III behaved. This was because the King wanted absolute monarchy. King Otakar II of Bohemia became the most important prince in Europe. He got more land by fighting wars and also when his family died some of their land became his. Iceland and Greenland knew of and recognised the overlordship of Norway but when the Norse invaded Scotland the Scottish were able to stop them and they made peace. In Spain the Reconquista was still happening and several important cities were captured again from the Moors. The way the pope was elected was made better. The parliaments of Ireland and England met for the first time.

Several important cultural achievements were made in the decade. Roger Bacon published important scientific work named "Opus Majus." Also, Thomas Aquinas published "Summa contra Gentiles". Important pices of architecture and sculptures were made in cathedrals in Europe. These include the Cathedral of Chartres and Nicola Pisano's pulpits for the Duomo di Siena and Pisa's Baptistery. In religion, the Sukhothai kingdom in Thailand adopted Buddhism as its official religion. In Europe anti-Semitism became worse because several authorities made laws which said that Jewish people must wear yellow badges so people knew who they were. Many Jewish people were killed in England and the Talmud was attacked and censored by the Catholic Church.

United States Constitution

The United States Constitution is the highest law of the United States of America. It was put in writing on September 17, 1787 by the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and later put into effect, or ratified, by representatives of the people of the first 13 states. When nine of the states ratified the document, they put forth a union of sovereign states, and a federal government for that union. That government started on March 4, 1789, taking the place of the Articles of Confederation.

The Constitution of the United States is the oldest federal constitution now in use.

Since 1787, changes have been made to the United States Constitution 27 times by amendments (changes). The first ten of these amendments are together called the Bill of Rights.

When it was written in 1787, the Constitution had a preamble and seven main parts, called articles.

The Preamble says:

The Preamble is not a law. It gives the reasons for writing the Constitution. The Preamble is one of the best known parts of the Constitution. The first three words, "We the people," are used very often. The six intentions that are listed are the goals of the constitution.

Article One: says that the U.S. Congress (the legislative branch) will make the laws for the United States. Congress has two parts, called "Houses," the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Article says who can be elected to each part of Congress, and how they are elected.

The House of Representatives has members elected by the people in each state. The number of members from each state depends on how many people live there. Each member of the House of Representatives is elected for two years. The Senate has two members, called Senators, for each state, no matter how many people live there. Each Senator is elected for six years. The original Constitution says that Senators should be elected by the state legislatures, but this was changed later by the seventeenth amendment.

Article One also says how the Congress will do its business and what kinds of laws it can make. It lists some kinds of laws the Congress and the states cannot make. Article One also makes rules for Congress to impeach and remove from office the President, Vice President, judges, and other government officers.

Article Two says that the President (the executive branch) will carry out the laws made by Congress. This article says how the President and Vice President are elected, and who can be elected to these offices. The President and Vice President are elected by a special Electoral College chosen by the states, for four years. The Vice President takes over as President if the President dies, or resigns, or is unable to serve. Article Two also says that the President is in charge of the army and navy. He can make treaties with other countries, but these must be approved by two-thirds of the Senate. He appoints judges, ambassadors, and other officers, but the Senate also must approve these appointments. The President can also veto bills. However Congress can override the veto

Article Three says there will be a court system (the judicial branch), including the Supreme Court. The article says that Congress can decide which courts, besides the Supreme Court, are needed. It says what kinds of "cases and controversies" these courts can decide. Article Three also requires trial by jury in all criminal cases, and defines the crime of treason.

Article Four is about the states. It says that all states must give "full faith and credit" to the laws of the other states. It also says that state governments must treat citizens of other states as fairly as they treat their own citizens, and must send arrested people back to another state if they have been charged with a crime. 

Article Four also says that Congress can make new states. There were only 13 states in 1787. Now there are 50 United States. It says Congress can make rules for Federal property and can govern territories that have not yet been made into states. Article Four says the United States must make sure that each state has a republican form of government, and protect the states from invasion and violence.

Article Five says how to amend, or change, the Constitution. Congress can write a change, if two-thirds of the members in each House agree. The state governments can call a convention to write changes, although this has not happened since 1787. Any change that is written by Congress or by a convention must be sent to the state legislatures or to state conventions for their approval. Congress decides whether to send a change to the legislatures or to conventions. Three-fourths of the states must approve a change for it to become part of the Constitution.

An amendment can change any part of the Constitution, except one — no amendment can change the rule that each state has equal suffrage (right to vote) in the Senate.

Article Six says that the Constitution, and the laws and treaties of the United States, are higher than any other laws. It also says that all federal and state officers must swear to "support" the Constitution. 

Article Seven says that the new government under the Constitution would not start until conventions in at least nine states approved the Constitution.

Since 1787, Congress has written 33 amendments to change the Constitution, but the states have ratified only 27 of them. 

The first ten amendments are called the Bill of Rights. They were made in 1791. All of these changes limited the power of the federal government. They were:
After the Bill of Rights, there are 17 more changes to the Constitution that were made at different times.

Space-time continuum

The space-time continuum is a mathematical model that combines space and time into a single construct. This spacetime is usually explained with a model where space is three-dimensional and time has the role of the fourth dimension. 

If one follows the model of space that Euclid had, our universe has three dimensions of space, and one dimension of time. By combining space and time into a single manifold, physicists have simplified a good deal of physical theory, as well as described in a more uniform way the workings of the universe at both levels: the very large (supergalactic) and very small (subatomic).

Where an important quantity of matter exists, it changes the geometry of spacetime, this (curved) geometry can be understood as gravity. The white lines on the picture on the right do not represent the curvature of space, but instead represent the coordinate system imposed on the curved spacetime which would be rectilinear(straight and uncurved) in a flat spacetime.

In classical mechanics, the use of spacetime over Euclidean space is optional, as time is independent of mechanical motion in three dimensions. In relativistic contexts, however, time cannot be separated from the three dimensions of space as it depends on an object's velocity relative to the speed of light.

The origins of this 20th century scientific theory began in the 19th century with fiction writers. Edgar Allan Poe stated in his essay on cosmology titled "Eureka" (1848) that "space and duration are one." This is the first known instance of suggesting space and time to be different perceptions of one thing. Poe arrived at this conclusion after approximately 90 pages of reasoning but employed no mathematics. In 1895, H.G. Wells in his novel, The Time Machine, wrote, “There is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along it.” He added, “Scientific people…know very well that Time is only a kind of Space.” 

Albert Einstein's 1905 theory of special relativity is the beginning of the concept of spacetime, but the first mathematical theory of spacetime was proposed by one of his teachers, the mathematician Hermann Minkowski, in a 1908 essay. 
His concept of Minkowski space is the earliest treatment of space and time as two aspects of a unified whole, the essence of special relativity. The idea of Minkowski space also led to special relativity being viewed in a more geometrical way, this geometric viewpoint of spacetime being important in general relativity too. The 1926 thirteenth edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica included an article by Einstein titled "space-time".

Esztergom

Esztergom is a city in Hungary, 45 kilometers north of Budapest. 30 928 people live in Esztergom. It is the center of the Roman Catholic Church in Hungary, and the Constitutional court is in the city. There are a lot of rich museums in the city.

Esztergom is on the right side of the river Danube. There are big islands on the Danube. There are mountains to the east, that surround the city. The city is 100,35 km² big.

The city was founded in 972 by Géza of Hungary. It is one of the oldest cities in Hungary. Until 1249 it was the capital of the country. The archbishops built many schools, churches, palaces, and the kings of Hungary built castles. In 1242 the city was attacked and destroyed by mongols, but the castle on the hill was not. After the attack king Béla IV. moved to Buda, and gave the city to the archbishop. In 1543 the city was taken by the Turks, who built many spas. The Hungarians tried to take back the city many times, so it was destroyed again in the wars. The Turks left Esztergom in 1683. In 1822 Alexander Rudnay, the archbishop started building a big temple called a basilica. It is the biggest temple and the tallest building in the country, and the third biggest temple in Europe.

<doc id="37503" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37503" title="Public transport">
Public transport

Public transport (public transportation in the United States) is a way for the public (all the people) to travel around. It is a way for people to travel quickly and cheaply without needing their own cars. Public transport lets many people travel at the same time.

Public transport started around 1826 in Nantes, France and has become the easiest way to travel. The first forms of public transport were ferries (big public boats), and animals, such as horses. Horses also pulled carts. People would sit in the carts and the horses would pull them where they wanted to go.

The main types of public transport are buses, trolleybuses, trams and trains. Trams were first used in the late 1860s and used to be pulled by horses. Now trams are electric and run on a line of cable. Buses drive on the road, like cars do. Trolleybuses are like buses, but they use electricity from two wires above the road. Trains run on a track and are very fast. Many places use trams and trains as a form of public transport.

Many people who do not have cars use buses, trolleybuses, trams to go places near their house, and they use trains to go places far away. Public transport is good because it is easy to use so anybody can go on it.

When using public transport people may need a ticket or card to be able to get on. On trams they get a ticket that they put in a machine and it tells them when their ticket runs out. On buses and trolleybuses they buy their ticket from the driver and put it into a machine, and on trains they use a ticket to get into the train station to catch their train. A timetable tells them when they come.

Public transport is also good for the environment. When people use public transport it means that there are fewer cars on the road. With fewer cars on the road there is less pollution created in the world. Another good thing about public transport is the cost. It is very cheap to catch public transport every day and lots of people like public transport better than their cars.

Public transportation comes in many forms:






Some of these types are often not for use by the general public, e.g. elevators in offices and apartment buildings, buses for personnel or school children, etc.


Stations are an important aspect of any public transportation system. Specific types include:

In addition one can get on or off of a taxi at any road where stopping is allowed. Some fixed-route buses allow getting on and off at suitable unmarked locations along that route, typically called a hail-and-ride section.

Money is needed to build and operate a public transit system. The money comes from ticket revenue, government subsidies and advertisements. If ticket prices are too high, people will not use public transit. So, most systems charge passengers less than the full cost of building and operating the system. The percentage of total revenue that passengers pay is known as the farebox recovery ratio. Sometimes, a small amount of income comes from land development and rental income from stores and vendors, and parking fees. Some subway systems get money from telecommunication companies by leasing tunnels and rights-of-way to carry fiber optic communication lines.

Most—but not all—public transport systems need users to buy of a ticket to use the system. Tickets may either be bought before the time of the ride, at the time of the ride, or both. Tickets can be paper ticket, metal or plastic tokens, or an electronic card (smart card, contactless smart card). Sometimes, a ticket has to be validated (marking the time of the ticket's use). A paper ticket is stamped when it is validated. An electronic ticket is checked in.

Tickets may be valid for a single (or return) trip, or valid within a certain area for a period of time. The fare (price of the ticket) is based on the travel class, either based on the traveled distance, or on a zone pricing.

The tickets may have to be shown or checked automatically at the station platform or when going onto the system, or during the ride by a conductor. Operators may choose to control all passengers, allowing sale of the ticket at the time of ride. Alternatively, a proof-of-payment system allows passengers to enter the vehicles without showing the ticket. Riders may or may not be controlled by a ticket controller. If the rider does not show proof of payment, the operator may fine the rider.

Multi-use tickets allow a passenger to travel more than once. These include "return tickets" where the passenger pay for two trips at one time. It also includes period cards allowing travel within a certain area (for instance month cards), or during a given number of days that can be chosen within a longer period of time (for instance eight days within a month). Some transit systems sell tickets (passes) aimed at tourists that allow free or discounted entry at many tourist attractions, typically include zero-fare public transport within a city. Period tickets may be for a particular journey (in both directions), or for a whole network.

A free travel pass allows free and unlimited travel within a system. Free passes are sometimes granted to particular social sectors, for example students, old people, children, employees ("job ticket") and the physical or mentally disabled. In the United States, an employer can pay for a portion of a travel pass without that payment being taxed. So, transit systems allow employers to pay the system directly and to distribute the passes to employees.

Free or Zero-fare public transport services are funded in full by means other than collecting a fare from passengers. 

Zero-fare services may be funded by national, regional or local government through taxation or by commercial sponsorship by businesses. They usually use relatively small vehicles such as buses and trams.

Several mid-size European cities and many smaller towns around the world have converted their entire bus networks to zero-fare.

Local zero-fare shuttles or inner-city loops are far more common than city-wide systems.

Some means of rail-based public transport are also tourist attractions and/or well known landmarks in their own right. These include San Francisco's famous cable cars, the Molli steam powered train in Bad Doberan, the kusttram along the whole Flemish coast, the Schwebebahn Wuppertal, the Seattle Monorail, and the Christchurch Tram

Crofton is a town on Vancouver Island, in British Columbia, Canada. It is a small town with only 2,500 people living in it. Crofton lies alongside the water. A miner named Henry Croft founded the town in 1902 so he could do better mining on the mountains around Crofton. But soon after, the mining stopped. In 1956, a mill that makes paper was built in Crofton. Today, that mill has over 1,000 workers. Because Crofton is on the water, it has a ferry that takes people to Salt Spring Island, which is nearby.

Western Australia

Western Australia is one of the six states of Australia. It is the biggest state in Australia measured by amount of land. It has a population of about two million people. Its capital city is Perth.

In 1827, a Captain in the British army, James Stirling, sailed up the Swan River and liked what he saw. He told the British government, and in 1829, Britain sent settlers to Western Australia. On June 18, 1829, the new Governor James Stirling claimed all the land of Australia that was not already included in New South Wales as the new colony of Western Australia. 
as well as many buildings for the government. In 1868, Britain stopped sending convicts.

Until 1901, Australia did not exist - it was six separate colonies governed by Britain. This worked well when everybody was British and there were only a few people. But now there were thousands of people and many of them had never been to Britain, an eight month journey away by sea. 

They decided to join together to form one new country, the Commonwealth of Australia. This was called Federation, and happened in 1901. Western Australia did not want to join, because the other colonies were thousands of kilometres away. They joined when the other colonies promised to build a railway to Perth.

In 1933, the Western Australian people did not want to be part of Australia any more. The main reason was that Western Australia had to give money to the rest of Australia to pay for national services like the army and education, but they were not seeing the benefits. As well, the Great Depression had happened and many people were homeless and poor all over the world, including Western Australia. 

The government decided to hold a referendum and ask the people whether they wanted to start their own country, and 68% said yes. However, the rest of Australia and the British Parliament stopped it. Even today, the indian Western Australians do not want to be part of Australia but they have to cause they are connected to it.

After that, things got back to normal. The Great Depression ended and the Second World War began, and many Western Australians went off to fight. Some of them had to stay here, because in 1942, the Japanese bombed the town of Broome in the far north.

When the war ended, a lot of people from Europe who had lost their homes in the war came to Western Australia, as land was still very cheap. In the 1960s, iron ore was found in the north of the state, which could be made into steel. This discovery made Western Australia very rich, and iron ore still brings in a lot of money.

Perth grew from being a small town to being a big city in just 30 years. By 1985 it had over a million people and is still getting bigger today. Due to the mining boom in the state, there has been an influx of people from the Eastern states to take advantage of the higher wages in industry.

South Australia

South Australia is one of the six states of Australia. Its Capital is Adelaide.

South Australia is in the southern central part of the country. It is one of the driest parts of the continent. South Australia gets very little rain. 

The state has a total land area of 984,377 km² (380,070 sq mi). It is the fourth largest of Australia's states and territories. In 2006 there were 1,554,397 people living in South Australia.

Sturt's Desert Pea, Swainsona formosa, is the flower that represents South Australia. It was made the emblem on November 23, 1961.

South Australia was a "freely-settled", planned British province. Settlement began on December 28, 1836. This was when the state was "proclaimed" at The Old Gum Tree by Governor Hindmarsh. The aim was to create the province as a center of civilization for free immigrants, promising civil liberties and religious tolerance. 

Today, the state is known for its festivals and fine wine.

The highest temperature recorded was 50.7°C at Oodnadatta on 2 January 1960.
The coldest temperature recorded was -8.2°C at Yongala on 20 July 1976.
The highest rainfall recorded was 272.6 mm at Motpena on 14 March 1989.

This comic book is about a teenage boy named Archie Andrews and his friends: Betty Cooper, Veronica Lodge, Reggie Mantle, and Jughead Jones. Every single character in this comic book is fictional and are created by Bob Montana. All characters were based on people he knew in Haverhill, Massachusetts. Other popular titles include "Sabrina the Teenage Witch", "Sonic the Hedgehog", and Josie and the Pussycats. Archie's first appearance was in Pep Comics #22 on December 22, 1941. This addition was drawn by Montana and written by Vic Bloom.

Archie lives in a small town named the "Riverdale". The state, or the general location of this town is not known. However, in the early years of the Archie comics, Riverdale was in Massachusetts, and Mr. Lodge was a senator for that state, but this is no longer part of the story.

<doc id="37559" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37559" title="Heroin">
Heroin

Heroin (also called Diacetylmorphine or Diamorphine) is a semi-synthetic opioid. It is an analgesic (a painkiller). It is made from the sap of the poppy plant. It is like other drugs made from the poppy plant sap, for example, opium or morphine. There is a high risk of getting addicted. Many countries consider it to be an illegal drug unless it its taken for medical purposes.

Heroin is a white or brown powder. People smoke or inject heroin to get a calm feeling of relaxation called "being high," or "euphoria". Heroin is a very addictive drug. This means that once a person starts taking heroin, they will want to take more heroin, even if it's making them sick. 

It is illegal to make, sell, and use heroin in most countries, unless a doctor has prescribed it for a person. Many people smuggle heroin and sell it illegally on the streets to make money. 

If people use heroin, they may take too much and get sick or even die. This is called an "overdose" (taking too much). As well, when people take heroin, they get intoxicated (like being drunk on alcohol). When a person is intoxicated, they can get hurt if they drive a car or other vehicle. As well, when a person is intoxicated, they may do dangerous things, such as have unsafe sex with a person that they do not know, or get into a violent fight with a person. There is also the danger of "Withdrawal". Withdrawal is when someone quits using an opiate, like Heroin, after they've been using it for a while. A user can have withdrawal symptoms even just after 3 days of continued use. Withdrawal can be one of the worst fears of a user, and they will do anything to not have to go through it. Withdrawal can make someone feel like they have the flu. Other symptoms are hot and cold sweats, chills, body aches, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and not being able to sleep. 
Heroin is a very addictive drug. This means that if a person starts taking the drug, they will want to keep taking it, and it will be hard to stop, even if the drug is making a person sick (ill). Addiction means that a person will do much more than usual to get enough money to buy another dose of the drug. Most of the time, this means that they will sell things they have. At some point, the person may have sold all their belongings. Sometimes, the only options left then are to work as a prostitute (that is to sell having sex for money), or to become a criminal, and do things like theft, robbery, or fraud. By making some drugs legal, it is possible that prices for hard drugs will drop, and the people addicted might become less involved in such extreme behaviors. 

Another danger from using heroin is infection with dangerous diseases such as HIV or Hepatitis C. When a person is injecting heroin, a person can get an HIV or Hepatitis C infection from another person if they are sharing the same syringe (needle). As well, if a person is "high" on heroin, they could get an AIDS or Hepatitis C infection from having unsafe sex with a person that they do not know.

There are many slang street names for this drug, and they can be different from place to place. Some of them are: China White, Dope, Horse, Junk, H, Smack and some call it by its name Heroin. In the early 1970s in Harlem (NYC), drug lord Frank Lucas had 98-100% pure product from Thailand called "Blue Magic."

Heroin was made in 1898, by the Bayer Company in Germany. It started as a cough medicine, and pain killer. People thought it would help with morphine and opium addiction. Instead it became a very addictive drug. Twelve years later doctors realized it was heroin that people became addicted to. The Harrison act of 1914, was the first of many attempts to control the use of heroin. The word "heroin" comes from the German word, "heroisch", which means powerful and heroic.

Kapellmeister, (pronounce: Ka-PEL-my-ster), is a German word which means a musician who is in charge of music-making. The word comes from the Latin word for "chapel". In German "Kapelle" got the meaning: "choir" (because they sang in a chapel). "Meister" means "master". 

The French word is maître de la chapelle. In Italian he is Maestro di Capella. In English he might be called Chapel Master or, more generally, Director of Music.

The word Kapellmeister is used to describe musicians in Germany who worked for a king, prince or rich nobleman. Until about 200 years ago, these people often had their own private orchestras. The Kapellmeister was like a Director of Music. He would be responsible for choosing any new musicians, rehearsing and conducting the orchestra, and composing any music that was needed.

Many famous composers had jobs as Kapellmeister. Johann Sebastian Bach worked from 1717 to 1723 as Kapellmeister for Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen. George Frideric Handel was Kapellmeister for George, Elector of Hanover, who later became George I of Great Britain. Joseph Haydn worked for many years as Kapellmeister for the Eszterházy family, a very important noble family of the Austrian Empire. 

A Kapellmeister could also be the Director of Music for a church. Sometimes, this would be called "Kantor" in Germany. Johann Sebastian Bach was called "Kantor" when he was Director of Music at the church of St Thomas in Leipzig from 1723-1750. 

By the 19th century, society in Europe had changed. The nobility were not as rich as they had been before, and many composers started to make a living as a freelance composer. Beethoven, for example, never became a Kapellmeister.

Sometimes, the word "Kapellmeister" is used in German today to mean the Director or conductor of an orchestra or choir. The title shows that they have to organize the orchestra or choir as well as conduct it.

Rabbi

Rabbi (in the Hebrew classic רִבִּי "ribbi"; in the Hebrew modern רַבִּי "rabbi") in Judaism signifies "professor, master" or literally "grand". The word ""Rabbi"" ("My Master") derives from the Hebrew root ""Rav"", that in the Hebrew biblical signifies "grand" or "distinct" (in knowledge). 

In Judaism, "rabbi" is a title of respect for a particularly learned member of a Jewish community. Most rabbis earn their title by studying Jewish law at a seminary or yeshiva. The primary role of a rabbi is to teach Torah. In addition, rabbis often act as the religious leader of a Jewish community. In contrast to many other religions, a rabbi is not required to be present at life cycle events in Judaism. Nevertheless, rabbis still normally preside over life cycle events.

Historically, only men could be rabbis. This is still true in Orthodox Judaism. Most non-Orthodox Jews allow women to be rabbis as well.

Three rabbis together can form a rabbinic court, or beit din. This is done when there is a legal conflict between two Jews. They judge the conflict based on Jewish law. This is also done when somebody wants to convert to Judaism.

Rabbis are also sometimes asked to supervise food preparation to make sure it is kosher. The presence of a rabbi does not make the food kosher or unkosher. It is just supervision. When this is done with packaged food, the packaging is often labeled with a hechsher. A hechsher is a symbol which means that the content of the package is kosher.

<doc id="37602" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37602" title="Super Mario Galaxy">
Super Mario Galaxy

Super Mario Galaxy is a video game by Nintendo. The game is for the Wii. "Super Mario Galaxy" is very different from older Mario games, and has some new gameplay in it. A sequel, Super Mario Galaxy 2, was also made.

Bowser has captured Princess Peach again, this time using a surprise attack over the so-called Mushroom Kingdom, with a battle fleet of flying boats by pulling the castle out of its foundation. Mario barely grasps onto the dug out piece of Earth, but is knocked off by one of Bowser's allies. He drifts out into intergalactic space, unconscious.

After waking up on a peculiar planet, Mario finds a playful star like creature, named a Luma and he must play hide and seek with the Luma and his friends to gain information about where he is. After successfully capturing all Lumas, the first Luma leads Mario up to a podium, where a beautiful woman in blue robes stands waiting. The woman is named Rosalina and she moves around space by using her mobile Observatory. It was her who gave the name 'Luma', after finding the first Luma, named 'Luma'. According to her story, one day she finds Luma stranded on Earth; this is the first time for her meeting Luma. She says that the observatory after Bowser stole its Grand Stars, which give the observatory its power. 

Mario must follow Bowser all the way out into outer space, find power stars and Grand Stars, defeat him, and rescue Peach with help of Lumas, launch stars, natives of different kinds of galaxies, and the Toad Brigade, a group of Toads. 

The game play is very similar to "Super Mario 64" with special moves done with the Wii Remote.

In Super Mario Galaxy, Mario can do a Star Spin attack, and can jump from planet to planet. The creator of the Mario games, Shigeru Miyamoto, is the director of this game, and gave Mario moves he has never had before.

Like the shines of "Super Mario Sunshine" or the stars of "Super Mario 64", "Galaxy" has things called star bits. They may be used to progress in certain parts of the game, or they can be used to stun enemies. Mario can collect star bits using the Wii Remote, simply by pointing at them. Mario can gain a life if he collects 50 of them.

The coin system has also changed. In the previous two games, every 100 coins collected earned a life, but in "Galaxy" he only needs 50. Also, Mario will not be able to collect 100 coins to get a star in a level; instead, once he defeats Bowser for the last time, the player can choose to return to a level, select the "Purple Comet" star, and can try to collect 100 purple coins (not normal coins) to earn a star.

Walmart () is a company created by Sam Walton in 1962. It is one of the world's largest companies, behind Exxon Mobil. Wal-Mart stores are large department stores that sell many different things. There are more than 8,000 Wal-Mart stores around the world, and over 2 million people work for Wal-Mart. 

Walmart is criticized for having a poor record on labor rights, especially regarding anti-union activity. It has also been criticized for once promoting "made in America" for its' products but now largely importing the products it sells, from developing nations. Many of these jobs replaced manufacturing jobs in the U.S. along with the fact that Walmart retail jobs replaced many "mom and pop" stores in the U.S. In 2005, movie director Robert Greenwald made a documentary movie called "Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Cost" that criticized Walmart. After this movie was announced, director Ron Galloway made a film that ended up being released at the same time called "Why Wal-Mart Works; and Why That Drives Some People C-R-A-Z-Y". This movie had a positive view of Walmart.

On October 29, 1929, the stock market crashed on what is known as Black Tuesday. A "crash" means that the prices of stock were lowered greatly, and no one wanted to buy it. Instead, they sold the stock for cheap prices. Also, banks were trying to buy stock with people's money (stored inside the bank), so the banks ran out of money too. Because people could not get money back from banks, only a few people could afford the cost of living. This was the start of the Great Depression.

Sir Thomas Stamford Bingley Raffles (July 6, 1781 – July 5, 1826), also known as Stamford Raffles, was the founder of the city of Singapore, and is one of the most famous Britons who expanded the British Empire.

Raffles was born on a ship "Ann" to Captain Benjamin Raffles (Father) and Anne Raffles (Mother). Although his family was in debt, they managed to give him money for his education. When he was 14, he started working as a clerk in the British East India Company. The company sent him to Southeast Asia to look for another port as the trade between Britain and China is increasing.

He married Olivia Mariamne Fancourt, who was a widow of Jacob Cassivelaun Fancourt, an assistant surgeon in Madras who had died in 1800.

When the British East India Company sent Raffles to Southeast Asia to look for a port, the company already had two ports, Penang and Bencoolen. However, these two ports were at a place far from the main trading area, the Straits of Melaka. Dutch's ports, Melaka and Java, were closer to the trading area, which made them able to control the trade. They cut off the trade between Penang and the important trading centres at the Malay Archipelago.

The British East India Company thus needed a new port south of Melaka to protect British ships, and so they chose Singapore for it had a lot of drinking water and a good location, in the centre of the Straits of Melaka.

Sega Dreamcast

Sega Dreamcast (Japanese: ドリームキャスト; originally called "Dural," and "Katana") is the fourth and last machine made by Sega that can play video games. It was sold before the PlayStation 2, GameCube, or Xbox came out. However, not many people bought it after the PlayStation 2 was released, so in the end Sega decided to stop making them. 

When it was time to make another video game machine after the Sega Saturn was released, Shoichiro Irimajiri asked Tatsuo Yamamoto from IBM Austin and his group to create it. However Hideki Sato's old group that made video game machines did not like this. Because of this, the two groups were in a competition to make the best machine.

Hideki Sato's group used Hitachi SH4 and PowerVR to make a video game machine called "White Belt". The name was later changed to "Guppy" and then "Katana".

Tatsuo Yamamoto's IBM/Motorola PowerPC 603e and 3dfx Voodoo 2 to make a video game machine called "Blackbelt" and then renamed to "Shark" in United States. In Japan, the machine was first called "Dural" and then renamed to "Katana" 

On April 1997, 3dfx told people that Sega was using their 3dfx Voodoo 2 for a video game machine. Sega however wanted this to be a secret and became very angry. Because of this, Sega used Hideki Sato's "Katana" machine instead of Tatsuo Yamamoto's.

Later on, 3dfx sued Sega because they thought Sega broke their promise to them.

After Sega released their Dreamcast, many other video game companies also released their video game consoles. This includes Sony, who released the PlayStation 2; Nintendo, who released the GameCube; and Microsoft, who released the Xbox.

The Dreamcast was released in Japan in November 27, 1998, and then released September 9, 1999 in North America. Originally, many people liked the Dreamcast and it sold a lot. In the United States, 300,000 machines were sold on the first week and Sega earned $98.4 million dollars.

To help the Dreamcast sell even more, Sega told many stores to show some of their best games to customers, like "Soul Calibur", "Sonic Adventure", "Power Stone", and "Hydro Thunder".

Electronic Arts, a video games company, said that they did not want to make games for the Dreamcast until it sold one million machines. This is because Electronic Arts' video games on the Sega Saturn did not make a lot of money. However, in three months when the Dreamcast did sell one million machines, Electronic Arts still did not want to make games for the Dreamcast and made games for the PlayStation 2 instead. 

In places like Europe Sega decided to let other companies make ads for the Dreamcast. However, Sega did not give the companies enough money, so the companies could not make as much ads as the PlayStation 2, another video game machine that was competing with the Dreamcast.

Many of these companies also forced people to pay a lot of extra money for the Dreamcast than in the USA and Japan. 

Some games were not even sold in Europe, because Sega was spending most of their time on selling the Dreamcast in the USA. Because of this, a lot of people who used to like Sega now liked Sony.

Sega's prestige among gamers was at the time heavily damaged because of the lack of good management/marketing back from the Sega Saturn, this also affected certain game developers such as Electronic Arts refusing to develop for the system because of the risk of the Dreamcast becoming just like the Sega Saturn, not selling well. This was a factor is why this Incredible ground breaking console did not reach its full potential. 

In the end, Sega told people on January 31, 2001 that they would be discontinuing the console production. Sega's last video game sold for Dreamcast was "Puyo Pop Fever", which was released on February 24, 2004. From then onwards, other people are still making Dreamcast games.

These accessories were sold by Sega to be used on the Dreamcast:

Counting

Counting is something people do to find out how many things there are of any kind. 

The person counting usually starts with the number one, and gives this number to the first thing. The next thing is given the number two. Then, the next thing is given the number three. If there is another thing, it gets the number four. If after this there is another thing, it gets the number five. More things get more numbers. Each thing gets its own number in this way. The last number given to the last thing counted shows how many things there are.



Counting is starting at a number and changing it up or down a certain number of times. In the examples above, counting started at one and then it changed by one each time something was counted. So at first the count was one. Then the count was changed by one, and one plus one is two, so the count was two. Then the count of two was changed by one again, and two plus one is three, so the count was three. 

Counting can go up or down. Counting can be done on fingers.

Space Shuttle

The Space Shuttle was a spacecraft which was used by the American National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or NASA. Space Shuttles were used to carry astronauts and cargo into space. Cargo such as satellites, parts of the International Space Station or scientific instruments were taken up into space by the space shuttle. It was a unique spacecraft because it could be used again and again.

The Space Shuttle was made up of 3 parts. These were the orbiter, the external fuel tank and solid rocket boosters. 

The orbiter was shaped like a large airplane with wings and a tail. This allowed the Space Shuttle to glide and land on a runway. This allowed the reusable part of the Shuttle to be very large. Many spacecraft which came before the Space Shuttle, like the Apollo used parachutes when landing, and landed on the ocean. People have said that the Shuttle was very much like a pickup truck because of its usefulness. 

The shuttle was launched out of Earth's gravity and into space by 3 rocket engines on the back of the orbiter along with help from 2 long white Solid Rocket Boosters (also called SRBs) Fuel for the shuttle was stored in the large, usually orange, External Fuel Tank (also called ET). Before the shuttle reached orbit, the SRBs were released and fell into the Atlantic Ocean where they were towed back to shore for reuse. The ET was also released but broke up and fell into the Indian Ocean and was not reused.

The US space shuttles were:

A '†' next to a name means that the Shuttle was destroyed.

There was a Russian Shuttle called Buran. It flew one unmanned flight before being retired. The Buran was destroyed in a hangar collapse in 2002.

The shuttle was created in 1973. It replaced the Apollo capsules. The first flight was a test of the landing and maneuvering abilities of the shuttle. This flight was done by the Space Shuttle Enterprise. The first shuttle flight in space was on April 12, 1981. It was done by the Space Shuttle Columbia.

On January 28, 1986 the Space Shuttle Challenger disintegrated 73 seconds into the flight of STS-51L. It caused a year long stall in space flight.

In the 1990s the Shuttle began working on the International Space Station (ISS). This was its main job of the shuttle since then.

Also in the 1990s, the Space Shuttle launched the Hubble telescope into space. Shuttle missions returned 5 times to repair and improve cameras and scientific instruments on the telescope.
On February 1, 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia broke up while returning STS-107 to Earth over Texas. The accident was caused by damage to the heat-shield which protects it from the heat of reentry into the Earth's atmosphere. It again caused a long delay until the next shuttle flight.

Now all the shuttles have retired they may be replaced by the Orion (spacecraft). But the government has not yet funded this spacecraft.

The three remaining shuttles will go on display at museums. Enterprise, currently at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia; will move to the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum, in New York City and the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center will receive the Discovery. Endeavour will go to the California Science Center in Los Angeles and Atlantis will stay in Florida at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.

Thor is the red-haired and bearded god of thunder in Norse mythology. He is the son of Odin and Jord. The ancient Norse believed that during Ragnarök, Thor would kill and be killed by Jörmungandr. 

Thor was one of the most powerful Norse gods. He was well known for his fights with the race of giants. He was said to protect Asgard (the home of the gods) and Midgard (the home of man). 

Thor was believed to be the son of Odin (Wotan or Woden) and the giantess Jörd (Jord, the Earth). His wife is called Sif. With his mistress, the giantess Járnsaxa, Thor had his sons Magni and Modi, and with Sif he had his daughter Thrud. Thor also had a stepson called Ull who was a son of Sif.

Thor was said to travel in a chariot drawn by the goats Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr. 

According to writings known as sagas, Thor owned a short-handled war hammer, Mjolnir. When the hammer was thrown, it returned magically to the owner. The strike of the hammer caused thunderclaps. With the hammer, Thor performed his giant-killing duties.In English, Thursday is named after Thor.

Windsurfing

Windsurfing is a water sport invented in the U.K. by Peter Chilvers in 1958 on Hayling Island, Hampshire. It is performed on a large board with a sail. The sail both empowers the board and helps the board change directions. The sport is a combination of surfing and sailing. Windsurfers can travel on either flat or rough water, as long as there is wind. Windsurfing is done mostly in the summer and spring.

Windsurfing competitions can be freestyle or racing around buoys and it features in the Olympics.

Windsurfing sails come in many different sizes. The larger the sails are, the more human strength is needed to control them, but the more power is given to go faster. The different sizes of board affect the speed. Again, the thinner the board, the faster you will go. The range of thickness depends on the materials used. 

Another sport similar to windsurfing is kite surfing. All these sports have boards that range in size and price, but all need much practice to be done well. There are many sporting places around the world that people travel to just to go surfing. Some of the best places are in the west coast of the United States, Hawaii, Australia, and Indonesia.

Thoroughbred

Thoroughbred is a type of horse. They are mainly used for racing. 
Horses have been used for many years, for farm, racing to harness work. Horses were the fastest way for people to travel on land before cars were invented and the only way to travel long distances in a reasonable amount of time. Most horse breeds have been bred for a specific reason; the thoroughbred race horse was bred to run. Thoroughbreds originate from the Arabian breed, and all thoroughbreds can be traced back to three original sires (fathers): The Byerley Turk, The Darley Arabian, and The Godolphin Arabian.
Thoroughbreds are known around the world for their speed, but also for their jumping ability, which make them good for show jumping and other horse activities. Although thoroughbreds generally are slightly temperamental, they are very trainable and loyal. 

Thoroughbreds are generally tall and sleek, with long legs to help carry them along the race track. Thoroughbreds can be many colours, such as bay (a colour which is brown with a black mane and tail), chestnut (red-brown), black and gray.

The appearance of the Thoroughbred reveals its Arabian ancestry. It has a refined head, with widely spaced, intelligent eyes, a long, arched neck and prominent withers. The shoulder is extremely sloped. The heart girth is deep and relatively narrow. The croup is high and the quarters are substantial. The legs are clean and long with pronounced tendons. It has a long, low stride, giving it incomparable speed as a race horse. The Thoroughbred is predominately bay in color, but gray, black, brown and chestnut are also found. It stands between 15 and 17 hands. The Thoroughbreds best suited for sprinting have shorter backs, more substantial quarters and less height. 

The Thoroughbred's genetic origin is Arabian. The Arabian foundation stallions which were brought to Britain in the late 1600s and early 1700s were bred to domestic mares – very probably Scottish Galloways – although they may have been bred to Arabian mares, too. A substantial number of early Thoroughbreds were bred in the vale of Bedale in the County of Yorkshire in Northern England. 

The foundation stallions of the Thoroughbred breed and years in which they arrived in England were: the Byerly Turk (1689), the Darley Arabian (1705) and the Godolphin Arabian (1728). Their progeny were the first Thoroughbreds, per se, and although the foundation stallions had many off-spring, three of their descendants stand out as supreme: Herod, Eclipse and Matchem. In the lines of these horses were some outstanding Thoroughbreds: for instance, Princequillo and Round Table descend from Herod; Citation and Sir Ivor descend from Eclipse; and Man O' War from Matchem. 

The first Thoroughbred to arrive in America was a stallion named Bulle Rock, by the Darley Arabian. He was imported to Virginia in 1730 by Samuel Gist. In 1757, Janus, a grandson of Godolphin Arabian, was imported and became the founder of the Quarter Horse breed. Diomed, who was imported in 1800 was the most important Thoroughbred imported to America in its early years. Lexington, by Boston, was foaled in 1850 and was the greatest sire of the 1800s.

Sound card

A sound card (audio card) is the part of the Computer hardware that controls the input and output of the sound signals. A sound card is what is known as an expansion card. This means that the card can be added to the motherboard.

Nowadays, most of the audio cards are integrated with the motherboard. That means they are build in onto a mainboard and can not be removed. In other words it is not an expansion card anymore. They offer only line-in, speaker, and microphone connections. For most users this is enough. When thinking of computer architecture the integrated circuit sound cards occupy less space and thus became very popular and practical, especially for laptop computers. For more features like MIDI ports for connection of musical instruments and low latency requirements (so that the sound does not come distorted under heavy system usage) sound cards as expansion cards can be used. Modern expansion sound cards use the PCI computer bus standard. Earlier sound cards used the ISA computer bus, which was half-duplex, so the sound cards could not record and play simultaneously.

What we hear in speakers is an analog (current, voltage or electric charge) output of the signal. For example stored on a hard disk digital code is transferred under a control of some application (for example Winamp) to the sound card. Up in there, a special chip, called digital-to-analog converter, changes the binary code into the analog sound. Afterwards, signal is sent to jack (in modern audio cards it has the green color) where the speakers are connected. The result is a nice waveform of our favorite digital medium, e.g. an mp3.

A typical sound input device is a microphone, connected to the red/pink jack socket. The sound wave is digitized and then it may be stored as a file using data compression algorithms which make the file smaller. Of course all of this is done under the control of some software.

Charlie Chaplin

Sir Charles Spencer "Charlie" Chaplin (April 16, 1889 – December 25, 1977) was a famous English actor and movie maker. He was very famous in silent movies (where there was no talking or sound). He acted, directed, scripted, and produced most of them.

Charlie Chaplin was a performer for nearly 70 years, starting at the age of five, and going until the age of 80. The character that Charlie Chaplin played most was called "the Tramp". The "Tramp" was a man of good manners, who wore a coat, a pair of big trousers, shoes, and a black hat. 

Charlie first started acting at age five. He acted in a music hall in 1894, standing in for his mother. When Charlie was a child, he was kept in bed for many weeks from a bad illness. At night, his mother would sit at the window and act out what was going on outside. His first important work came when he joined The Eight Lancashire Lads. In 1900, his brother Sydney helped him get the role of a comic cat in the pantomime "Cinderella". In 1903 he was in a play called “Jim: A Romance of Cockayne”. Chaplin was in Casey's 'Court Circus' variety show. The next year, he became a clown in Fred Karno's 'Fun Factory' comedy company.

Chaplin won two special Oscars. Chaplin had first been chosen for both "Best Actor" and "Best Comedy Directing". But then, instead, he was given a special award "for versatility and genius in acting, writing, directing and producing". Chaplin's second special award came 44 years later, in 1972. When getting this award, Chaplin had the longest standing ovation (people standing up and clapping) in Academy Award history.

On March 9, 1975, Charlie Chaplin was knighted in England by Queen Elizabeth II. 

Chaplin died on Christmas, 1977, in Switzerland. He died of a stroke, at the age of 88. On March 1, 1978, his body was stolen by a small group of Swiss people. They were trying to get money from Chaplin’s family. This plan didn’t work. The perpetrators were caught, and Charlie’s body was found 11 weeks later near Lake Geneva. He was buried under concrete to prevent further incidents.

Field hockey

Field Hockey is a well-liked sport for both men and women. It is played in many countries all around the world.

The game is played between two teams and each team is made up of eleven players. 

Field hockey is played with a ball on natural grass, or on sand-based or water based artificial turfs with a small hard ball. 

The field played on is rectangular and has a goal at each end. A semi-circle about 15 meters from the goal is known as the shooting circle. Goals can only be scored when the ball is in the shooting circle. 

The hockey stick that is used is a J shape and made out of wood, glass and fibre. The stick has a curve hook at the end. 

The positions are similar to the game soccer; in which they have fullbacks, halfbacks and forwards. 
Each team has a selected person who plays the goalkeeper. The goalkeepers try and stop the opposition team from scoring goals. 

Each player has to wear shin guards and a mouth guard, to protect their shins and protect their teeth.

Sudoku

Some magazines spell Sudoku as Su Doku.

To play, a person needs a sudoku grid (with nine rows, nine columns, and nine boxes that are separated by the thicker, darker lines) and a pen or pencil. Using the pen or pencil, the person must fill in all the empty squares without using the same number twice in each column, row, or box.

Many books have been created containing tips and strategies for completing sudoku puzzles. Books containing collections of puzzles have also been made, as well as internet Sudoku generators (computer programs that generate Sudoku puzzles).

There are many Sudoku variations that have been created since the original Sudoku's release. 

Jigsaw Sudoku (also called Squiggly Sudoku or Odd Sudoku) is just like a regular Sudoku puzzle, except that instead of the lines being perfect, they are different. Like regular Sudoku puzzles, you have to complete the grid.

Samurai Sudoku is a Sudoku variation that has 5 overlapping Sudoku grids formed like a big X. These puzzles are big and take a long time to complete. Like regular Sudoku puzzles, you have to complete all 5 grids in order to complete the puzzle.

Mini Sudoku is played on a 6x6 grid with 3x2 regions. The object is the same as in Sudoku, but the puzzle only uses the numbers 1 through 6.

Logic 5 is another Sudoku variation that uses 5x5 grids instead of 3x3 grids, and are in use at the Sudoku World Championships.

Boudica, also spelled Boudicca, known by the Romans as Boudicea (born approx. 25 AD, died 60/61 AD) was the queen of the Celtic Iceni people in Norfolk in the eastern part of Britain. 

Her husband was one of the British kings who tried to get along with the Romans as they invaded Britain. When he died, the Romans ignored his will and stole Boudica's lands and abused her and her two daughters.

She is most famous for leading her people in uprisings against the Roman Empire who controlled the island of Britain at the time. She first attacked what is now Colchester, later burnt Londinium (now London) to the ground and was somewhat successful in her efforts. Hearing of this, the Romans gathered a larger army and there was a battle. Sensing that she was going to be defeated, Boudica chose to commit suicide rather than be taken as a slave. 

A statue of Boudica was put up in the Westminster area of London in 1902. Now she is known by many across the world.

<doc id="37796" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37796" title="Choir (music)">
Choir (music)

A choir is a group of people who sing together. They rehearse together and sing at concerts or for religious services. Some choirs are professional (the singers are paid for their work in the choir). Other choirs are amateur choirs. Some amateur choirs let anyone who is interested sing with them, others may ask people to audition to see whether they are good enough before allowing them to join.
Parts of a choir include soprano, alto, tenor and bass

There are many kinds of choir:

Choirs usually sing in several parts, most often in four parts. This means that there are two or more singers who are singing the same notes. The parts are called soprano, alto, tenor and bass. This is shown as SATB. If the music divides into more than four parts this can be shown in the same way, e.g. SSAATTBB (for music in eight parts: two soprano lines, two alto lines etc) or SSATB (music in five parts with just the sopranos divided into two groups). Young children’s choirs may be unison choirs (all singing the same line), but older children will sing in two (SS) or three (SSA) parts or more.

The word chorus is used for the choir in an opera or oratorio or similar large work where there are also soloists (Soloists and chorus). The word “chorus” can also be used for the name of a choir.

The word choral means “sung”. A “choral society” is a choir of adults. They usually sing music for large choruses, often with an orchestra accompanying. Beethoven’s “Choral Symphony” needs a choir as well as an orchestra.

An a cappella choir is a choir which sings without any instrumental accompaniment.

A small choir is often called a chamber choir .

In popular music a group of singers may be simply called a vocal group .

The word choir can also mean the part of a church or cathedral where the choir sit. The choir is between the nave (the main body of the church) and the sanctuary (where the altar is). The singers will divide into two groups and sit facing one another on either side of the choir area in the “choir stalls”. In cathedrals the singers on the left (when facing the altar) are called “cantoris” and those on the right are called “decani” (pronounce: dee-CAY-nye).

A large pipe organ may have three or more manuals (keyboards). The third keyboard is called the "choir". Traditionally the sound from the choir organ comes from pipes in a separate box behind the organist, facing the choir (the singers). It is often used to accompany them.
Originally it was a separate instrument so that the organist had to turn round to play it. Later it became possible for the organist to play it from the main console. 

Some famous choirs include:

<doc id="37806" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37806" title="Motherboard">
Motherboard

The motherboard or mainboard is the main circuit board in a complex electronic system, like a computer. It is the most 'central' part of a computer. All of the different parts of the computer are connected to the motherboard. This lets them work together. In most computers, the motherboard is a big green board, but many come in different colors like black, red and yellow. 

Normal electrical parts must be kept on the motherboard. These "on-board" parts include transistors and resistors. Many of the major parts that are attached to the board are able to be removed in the future so that they can be upgraded. The CPU and memory (or RAM) are examples of parts that are usually removable.
Parts that are not "on-board" can be bought as a card. In fact, many of the on-board parts on today's computers were at one time an expansion card that became very popular. These were put on the board to free up the card slots for other things. Computers today usually have a memory port, 2 or more USB ports, a parallel port (for use with old printers usually), audio & microphone jacks, a network port and ports for the keyboard and mouse. There are also rare motherboards that have plugs only for very specific parts.

All of the slots and plugs both inside and outside the computer case are shaped a certain way to accept a certain type of part. Some will not even accept parts even one generation behind, such as the CPU and memory. Others, like the video plug have not changed in years. Some of the plugs, such as the video, keyboard and mouse plugs, are a special color. These colors make it easier to pair the plug to the port. The motherboard is also refered to as the PCB which stands for ‘printed circuit board’.

High-definition television

High-definition television (HDTV) is a new television broadcasting system which uses a higher resolution than a normal television. With HDTV, we can watch television in higher quality than old television, giving a more vivid and clear screen.

Most HDTV systems use digital signals with a 16:9 aspect ratio (width to height). This is different to SDTV (standard-definition television) which uses analog signals and a 4:3 aspect ratio.

HDTV picture resolution is at least twice that of SDTV, so it can present a more vivid screen than analog television or DVD. HDTV can control resolution efficiently.

Some videos on the website YouTube are in HD. YouTube is a free video sharing website that lets people upload, view and share videos.

Certain types of dogs are used to keep their owners or their owners safe from danger. These dogs are called guard dogs.

Different dog breeds can be used as guard dogs. A dog will sometimes bark at people it does not know and may alert its owner that way. Such dogs are called watchdogs and do not usually become a guard dog. Guard dogs may be trained to attack when given a command to do so. 

Different breeds of dogs are bred for different reasons, and these dogs are sometimes used as guard dogs: 


Lots of people want dogs to keep them safe or look after things, so they buy dogs that are trained to be guard dogs. Guard dogs have been trained by people to bark at strange people, and sometimes they even attack people that come near them.

Guard dogs are very important to people, but if you ever see a guard dog it is better to leave it alone as it might bark, bite or attack. This is the dogs’ job.

Andrew Fisher

Andrew Fisher (August 29, 1862 – October 22, 1928) was the fifth Prime Minister of Australia. He was Prime Minister three times. His government helped create the Royal Australian Navy and make Australia's own paper money. When he retired he moved to London.

Fisher was born in Crosshouse, Scotland, where he was educated at the Crosshouse Primary School. At the age of 10 he left school to work in the coal mines. In 1885 he moved to Australia where he worked in the coal mines at Burrum and Gympie. He was elected to the Queensland Parliament in 1892. In 1901 he married Margaret Irvine.

When Fisher was Prime Minister a number of important projects were undertaken. The Commonwealth Bank was set up, the Northern Territory of South Australia was transferred to the Commonwealth, the federal capital of Canberra was founded, and the construction of the trans-Australian railway line linking Perth to the other capital cities was begun. As well as introducing maternity allowances, Fisher acknowledged the need for greater political equality for women.

Andrew Fisher is one of Australia's most successful prime ministers because of the changes he made. He was the first prime minister to have a majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. He was able to have more than 110 Acts passed into law.

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is a video game made in 1998 for the Nintendo 64. It was the fifth Legend of Zelda video game and was the first to be in 3D. Many people think that it is one of the best games ever. In the game, the main character Link goes on an adventure to save the magical kingdom of Hyrule from the evil dark King named Ganondorf. To win, Link must fight Ganondorf and all his minions. A special object in the game is the ocarina that Link can play, causing different things to happen.

At the Kokiri Forest, the Great Deku Tree asks the fairy Navi to tell Link to come to him. When Link arrives, he learns that the Great Deku Tree is dying because of a curse placed on him by an evil man. Link is the only one who can save him. Link must enter the Great Deku Tree in order to save him.
Although Link defeats the most of the monsters inside the tree, he is too late to save him. Before the Great Deku Tree dies, he gives Link the Kokiri Emerald, a magic stone, and tells him that it was a man in black armor who put the curse on him. He also tells Link that he needs to go to Princess Zelda of Hyrule at Hyrule Castle. Before Link leaves, Saria, Link's friend, gives him the Fairy Ocarina, an instrument.

At Hyrule Castle, Link sneaks pass the guards and meets Princess Zelda. Zelda shows Link, through a window, a strange man with evil eyes. She tells Link that the man is Ganondorf. She also tells him that Ganondorf wants to steal the Triforce, a magic symbol of the Gods, and control the world. To defeat him, Link needs to find three magical "Spiritual Stones" (Kokiri Emerald being one of them) and the magical Ocarina of Time.

It was a very popular game, and many people liked it. Five million copies of the game were sold around the world after half a year, and 7.6 million copies were sold in all. 

Many people were happy with this game, although there were a few, small problems. One problem was that players cannot skip through the parts when people talk. Another was that players cannot play against the boss monsters that they have already killed. 

Overall, many websites and magazines think this game is one of the best games ever made. GameSpot, "Famitsu", IGN, "Electric Gaming Monthly", "Edge", and "Nintendo Power" all gave the game perfect scores.

The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) (, ) is a partially recognized state that claims sovereignty over the entire territory of Western Sahara. SADR was proclaimed by the Polisario Front on February 27, 1976 in Bir Lehlu, Western Sahara. The SADR government currently controls between 20% and 25% of the territory it claims. It calls the territories under its control the Liberated Territories or Free Zone. Morocco controls and administers the rest of the disputed territory and calls these lands its Southern Provinces. The SADR government considers the Moroccan-held territory occupied territory, while Morocco considers the much smaller SADR held territory to be a buffer zone.

Plutonium

Plutonium is the chemical element with the atomic number 94 and chemical symbol Pu. It is a highly radioactive metal. It is the metal used in most nuclear weapons. The chemical element plutonium has some different isotopes. The most important isotope of plutonium is Pu (or plutonium-239). It takes 24,110 years for half of a sample of plutonium-239 to decay, which is called its half-life. It can be made from natural uranium and is fissile. The isotope that has the longest half-life is Pu (or plutonium-244). Plutonium-244 has a half-life of about 80 million years. The half life of Pu is long enough that some of this isotope of plutonium is found in very small amounts in nature.

Plutonium can react with water, oxygen, carbon, halogens, nitrogen, and silicon. It forms oxides and hydrides in moist air, causing the plutonium sample to expand by up to 70%. Plutonium from the expanding sample can flake off and catch fire at room temperature. Plutonium is also toxic, although it is less toxic than many people think. The reactivity and toxicity of plutonium make it difficult to handle.

<doc id="37868" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37868" title="Al Jazeera">
Al Jazeera

Al Jazeera (in Arabic: الجزيرة‎ al-Jazi'yra) is an Arabic-language television channel from Doha, Qatar. Al Jazeera means "The Island" in Arabic. It is named that way because it is the only independent news network in the Middle East. At first it was a satellite TV channel which broadcast in Arabic only. Now there is also a channel in English, a sports channel, a conference channel, a documentary channel and a children's channel.

Next to its original channel Al Jazeera also has many other channels about specific things.

The first Al Jazeera channel was created in 1996. This was made possible with 150 million US$ from the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa.

In April 1996 the BBC World channel, which operated in Arabic, was shut down. This channel was partly owned by Saudi-Arabia. Many of the journalists from this station started working with Al Jazeera. The channel started broadcasting at the End of 1996. 
Because Al Jazeera was available in the whole region via satellite, it changed the television landscape of the region. Before that people could only watch channels that were censored by the different states. Al Jazeera brought a new level of freedom of speech in television to the Middle East. Al Jazeera has always broadcasted controversial on many governments in the Middle East, for example Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar. It also was critical about Syria's relationship with the Lebanon and of the judiciary in Egypt. For example on January 27, 1999 Al Jazeera had critics of the government of Algeria on their live program "El-Itidjah el-Mouakass" (Arabic for "The Opposite Direction"). To stop people from watching this program in Algeria over satellite, the government of Algeria cut the electricity in large parts of the country. At that time many people outside the Middle East did not know about Al Jazeera. Those people who knew it said generally good things about Al Jazeera. Because of good reporting from the Lebanese Civil War in 2000/2001 Al Jazeera got even more viewers. However it only became know worldwide after it broadcast statements from al-Quaeda leaders in 2001.
Most people think that people that live in the Middle East are given little information and that what they get is biased toward the government. Many people in the Arab world see Al Jazeera as a good and true source of information. Some scholars use the word of "contextual objectivity", which means that Al Jazeera shows both sides of a story, but still manages to be popular with the audience. Because of this it is probably the most watched news channel in the Middle East.
More and more channels, for example BBC and CNN, are using material from Al Jazeera.

The first Al Jazeera can be watched all over the world with several different satellite and cable systems. In the U.S. Al Jazeera can be watched on DVB-S on the Galaxy 25 and 23 satellites. In Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East it can be received via DVB-S on the Astra and Hot Bird satellites. In Australia Al Jazeera can be watched via the Optus C1 satellite and in the United Kingdom it can be watched via Sky and Freesat.

Boron

Boron is a chemical element. It has the chemical symbol B. It has the atomic number 5. It is a metalloid (it has properties of a metal and a non-metal). Much boron is found in chemical compounds in its ore borax. Boron is never found free in nature.

Two types of boron are found (allotropes). Amorphous boron is a brown powder and metallic (crystalline) boron is black and hard and a weak conductor at room temperature.

Pure boron is used as a dopant (a substance added to semiconductors to change how it behaves with electricity) in the semiconductor industry. Chemical compounds of boron are important as to make strong materials not weigh very much, as nontoxic insecticides and preservatives, and for chemical synthesis.

Plants need boron in them to live. Very small amounts of boron are needed in animal's bodies so that they are very healthy. How it keeps animals healthy is not known in a lot of detail. 

Boron was discovered by Sir Humphry Davy, an English chemist, in 1808.

Boron melts at 2075 °C (3767 °F), and boils at 4000 °C (7232 °F).

Fireplace

A fireplace is a brick or metal structure used to hold a fire. Fireplaces are most often used for heating but they can also be used for cooking. The part of the fireplace that holds the fire is called a "firebox" or a "firepit". There is a chimney or flue above the firebox that lets the smoke from the fire go outside.

Until the early 1900s, most homes had one or more fireplaces as a source of heat for the residents of the house. In the mid-1900s, gas, oil, and electric heaters became more common and fireplaces were used less often as a source of heat. In the late 1900s, fireplaces were less commonly built in new houses.

Buffalo Bill has been abducting women and skinning them. 

The movie was released in 1991. Jonathan Demme won an Academy Award for Best Director. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins both won Oscars (for their playing Clarice Starling and Dr. Hannibal Lecter). The movie also won Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture. It is one of only three movies to win the five most important Academy Awards.

Hopkins' performance as Lecter is one of the shortest lead acting Oscar-winning performances ever, as Hopkins is only on screen for seventeen minutes in the entire movie.

<doc id="37914" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37914" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">
Wikipedia:Assume good faith

To assume good faith is an important part of Wikipedia. It basically means to accept many of the edits done by people on here to be of good intentions, whether they made a mistake or not. By letting anyone the ability to edit, we believe that most of the people who work on here are trying to help it, instead of trying to destroy it. This belief must be shared by everyone, for the good of the project. If this was not true, a project like Wikipedia would not work. When you believe that a mistake someone made was an attempt to help the project, correct it without being mean to the editor. When you do not agree with someone, remember that they believe that they are helping. Think about using talk pages to explain, and give others the chance to do the same. This can avoid conflict and stop problems from getting worse.

Be patient with new editors and do not . Wikipedia is different from most cultures and communities, and many people may not know about how we work. They may make mistakes or not show respect for community policies. A new editor may believe that a policy should be changed to match their experience somewhere else. Also, many new editors may be experts or have experiences that are helpful for our project. These people are just trying to help.

Assuming good faith is about intentions (why people do what they do), not actions (what they do). People who try to help sometimes make mistakes, and you should correct those mistakes. However, you should not think their mistakes were meant to be hurtful or vandalism. Correct their mistake, but do not be mean or rude. You will probably not agree with everyone here. Even if they are wrong, that does not mean they are trying to make Wikipedia worse. You may even find it hard to work with some people. That does not mean they are trying to make Wikipedia worse either. It is never necessary that we assume an editor's actions are in bad faith, even if bad faith seems clear, because reverting and blocking can be performed because of actions, not intent.
Saying that the other side in a conflict is not assuming good faith can be a form of not assuming good faith.

This policy does not require editors to continue to assume good faith when there is evidence that they have bad faith. Actions that are not consistent with good faith include vandalism, sockpuppetry, and lying. Assuming good faith also does not mean that no action by editors should be criticized, but instead that criticism should not be attributed to badness unless there is specific evidence of badness.

<doc id="37918" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37918" title="Legion of Net. Heroes">
Legion of Net. Heroes

The Legion of Net. Heroes also called LNH is a "shared universe" setting in which many writers use the same characters, ideas, and places in their stories, often working together. It is also the name of the most important group in the setting.

On April 27, 1992, a member of the USENET newsgroup rec.arts.comics said that his name was Spelling Boy. Two days later, another member, named Dan'l Danehy-Oakes, took the name California Kid and said he was a member of the "Legion of Net.Heroes". Soon others were choosing colourful names for themselves, such as Cheesecake-Eater Lad and CAPTAIN CAPITALIZE. 

On May 5, Steven Librande got fed up with the silly "net.hero" names and chose the name Doctor Killfile a "net.villain". 

Benjamin Pierce or Marvel_Zombie Lad sent out a call for all net.heroes to fight back. Forty-four different writers worked together on the first LNH story, later called "The Cosmic Plot Device Caper". The story was never finished, and that summer most people forgot about the LNH.

In the fall, Todd "Scavenger" Kogutt brought the LNH back. Many new writers and stories appeared. Some writers published their stories in multiple parts or "serials" much like American comic books.

The LNH moved to its own newsgroup, alt.comics.lnh, before finding their permanent home on rec.arts.comics.creative , or RACC. RACC is home to other shared universes, like ASH, OMEGA and 8FOLD. Russ "Eagle" Allbery is RACC's moderator-- a person who makes sure ads and pornography do not appear on the group-- and archivist-- which means he keeps copies of all stories. 

The world of the LNH is called the Looniverse. In many ways it is like our own universe and Earth. But there are some differences. For example, net.heroes, net.villains, and super-powers exist.

Many of the cities in the Looniverse have silly names. The real city of Chicago is called "Sig.ago" in the Looniverse. The LNH itself is based in "Net.ropolis", and many stories take place there.

Many people in the Looniverse know that they are fictional characters-- something which is called "breaking the fourth wall". For example, in one story, "The Case of the Clueless Mystery" by Gary St. Lawrence , the heroes read the script for the story they are in to find out how to beat the villain.

The Looniverse contains many "mutually-exclusive ideas"-- things that can not exist at the same time. Sometimes, characters falling off a cliff are in real danger. Other times, they pop back into shape like cartoon characters. Some characters age in real time. Other characters never seem to age at all. Yet all these characters exist side-by-side. 

Many of the cities in the Looniverse have net-based names: Net.ropolis and Sig.ago, for example.

The headquarters of the LNH (called LNHHQ or LNHQ) is based in Net.ropolis. The team has hundreds of members. Some of them form "sub-groups". For example, one sub-group, the "TSK Force" , deals with small things like bad manners.

Legionnaires (also known as LNHers or LNH'rs) can stay at LNHQ for free. The building is very strange. The size of a room changes to fit the number of people in the room. 

It has been hinted in some stories that LNHQ is alive.

Because the LNH is so large, we can not list all its members in this article. Here are a few.


The LNH began in 1992 in our world. However, in the Looniverse, the LNH has been around a lot longer than that.

In the 19th Century, Net.ropolis was called Babbagetown. After the name of the city changed, there was a building called the Net.ropolis Hotel Grand. It later became the Legion of Net.Heroes Headquarters, or LNHHQ. 

The first LNH was formed in the 1920s by Boy Lad. He was the only member. His sidekick, Boy Lad Jr., was not allowed to join. Boy Lad disappeared.

Other heroes protected Net.ropolis:

1940s and 1950s:

Some members of the Classic Squad later became members of the LNH: Old Comics Man, Golden Man, and Kid Yesterdaze.

1960s and 1970s:

Sig.Lad, a member of the Net.astic Nine, later joined the LNH. Some members of the Legion of Net.Hippies also joined the Legion of Net.Heroes-- Nudist Man, Super Apathy Lad, and Procrastination Boy.

1980s:

Some stories say that today's LNH started in April of 1992, others say it started in the 1980s. 

After the "Cosmic Plot Device Caper", Rebel Yell became leader of the LNH. The entire LNH disappeared. In "501 Blues: The Long Road to Nowhere", Rebel Yell tried to find them all. 

The "Cry.sig on Infinite Net.Earths" was a parody of the DC Comics story Crisis on Infinite Earths. Like that story, it allowed LNH writers to change things about their characters. For example, before "Cry.sig", Cheesecake-Eater Lad was married and farted a lot. After "Cry.sig", he was single and made cheesecakes. It was like the earlier Cheesecake-Eater Lad never existed. In American comic books, this is called a retcon.

After "Cry.sig", the Ultimate Ninja joined the LNH. Rebel Yell shared the leadership with Ultimate Ninja and Continuity Champ. Later, Rebel Yell left the LNH . Ultimate Ninja became leader of the LNH.

The Ultimate Ninja thought an LNH member named Myk-El was a traitor and killed him. In the story "Retcon Hour", Myk-El came back to life and it was proved that he was not a traitor. "Retcon Hour" was one of the biggest LNH stories, and was written by fourteen people. 

In "Looniverse Adrift", the first net.villain, Dr. Killfile, was destroyed. Another villain, Tsar Chasm (a pun on sarcasm), also died. Both later returned from the dead. . .

Pocket Man married Organic Lass in the first LNH wedding .

In 1999, one of the most popular characters, Panta, was retconned out of existence. 

In 2000, Hexadecimal Luthor-- a parody of Superman villain Lex Luthor-- became President of the United States. He won a second term in 2004.

In March of 2001, the city of Sig.ago was destroyed. It was later rebuilt. 

In July of 2001, many characters were married :


Here are some of the best-liked LNH stories. As you can see, not all the stories are silly. There are many different types of stories and characters.












Other groups took ideas from the LNH and made their own groups, or "imprints".








There have been thousands of LNH stories by many writers. Writers work together on stories from all over the world: the LNH has writers from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, the Philippines, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand. It is an "open universe", which means that anyone can join. This is probably why it is still active.

Doncaster

Doncaster is a very large town in the north of England. It is in a Metropolitan County (an area of dense population) called South Yorkshire.

Doncaster is the second largest town in the United Kingdom and is larger and has more residents than many cities. Doncaster has fought to become a city for many years but has failed to achieve this title. Many believe this is due to the closeness to other very large cities such as Sheffield and Leeds whose influence may partially extend over Doncaster.

Doncaster is an ancient town that developed from a Roman fort called DANVM – modern spelling 'Danum' – pronounced (Da'-num) – and was built on a Roman road that linked London to York called 'Ermine Street'. The fort was built where Doncaster Minster now stands.

Later Doncaster developed into a Medieval township with a fortified boundary and historic gates. The location of the gates can still be seen in the town today. Doncaster also has a historic market that has existed for over 750 years!

As the centuries passed Doncaster became an important staging post on the route between London and Edinburgh. An ancient road called the 'Great North Road' passed straight through the very centre of Doncaster and the town grew around and along this road.

When railways were invented Doncaster became an important stop for trains travelling between Scotland and London and still does today. A very big factory for making trains was built in Doncaster.

Doncaster is famous for horse racing. Doncaster is one of the oldest racecourses in the world and hosts two famous horse races – The Doncaster Cup which is the oldest horse race in the world – and the St Leger Stakes which is the oldest classic horse race in the world. There has been horse racing in Doncaster for over 500 years. The horse racing started because of the horses that used to pull horse drawn coaches on the Great North Road.

Doncaster is also famous for steam trains. Some of the finest and fastest steam trains in the world were built in Doncaster. These trains include "The Flying Scotsman", "The Mallard" and "The Sir Nigel Gresley".

Doncaster was one of the first places in the country that made aeroplanes and had an airport. The first airshow in the country was held in Doncaster in 1908.

Doncaster has an international airport which was opened in 2005. The airport is growing very fast and lots of people from across the region and across Europe now use Doncaster as a popular destination – which is something that people have already been doing for the last 2000 years.

Doncaster is also the name of a suburb in eastern Melbourne, Australia. The suburb was no doubt named after the town in England and is home to two excellent state primary schools: Doncaster Gardens Primary School and Doncaster Primary School.

Argentine National Anthem

The lyrics of the Himno Nacional Argentino (the national anthem of Argentina) were written by Vicente López y Planes, and the music was composed by Blas Parera. This song was adopted as the national anthem on May 11, 1813, three years before the formal declaration of independence from Spain. May 11 is therefore "Anthem Day" in Argentina.

The following is the modern version, adopted in 1900, without the vivid attacks against Spain.

2008 comprehensive translation, adapted for the tune
"Same meaning, somehow more positive"

O'Hear "Mortals" these sacred words...
"We Are Free!, We Are Free!, We Are Free!"
O'Hear the sounds of broken old chains,
See enthroned our great noble Flag!
Her glorious passage was for us unveiled,
By "The United Provinces of the South".
And the world's free men now respond...
The Great Argentine people: "We Greet!"
The Great Argentine people: "We Greet!"
And the world's free men now respond...
The Great Argentine people: "We Greet!"
And the world's free men now respond...
The Great Argentine people: "We Greet!"

"Chorus"

May these Laurels be eternal,
Well we knew how to fetch them.
Well we knew how to fetch them.
Let us all live crowned with Glory,
Or full with Glory, let's swear to die.
Full with Glory, let's swear to die.
Full with Glory, let's swear to die.

Emily Dickinson

Emily Dickinson (b. December 10 1830 - d. May 15 1886) was an American poet. She is famous for writing many poems. Almost 1,800 poems she has written are known to this day. However, only a few were published while she was living. The poems she did publish were greatly changed by others before the world could see them. She is from the state of Massachusetts. She is also known for her poems being lyrical and unique. Sources say that she may have grown wildflowers and used them to show her mood in her poems. Today, many think Emily Dickinson's poetry has a big effect on poetry today.

Little is known on Dickinson’s life. Most of what is known about her is from people who knew her and may not all be true. Her family had a good amount of money, and had many friends. She had a normal life when she was a child. When she became an adult she spent more and more time alone and started wearing only white. Only after she died all of her poems were published and until 1955 they were changed to what was style of writing was popular at that time. She is best known for her talent as a poet. Most of her poems have been published and can be found at a library of any sort.

John Wesley

John Wesley (1703, Epworth, England-1791) was one of the founders of the Methodist church. Anglikanish minister and Christian theologian who was an early leader in the Methodist movement. Methodism had three rises: the first at Oxford University with the founding of the "Holy Club" the second while Wesley was priest in Savannah, Georgia; and the third in London after Wesley's return to England.Throughout his life, Wesley remained within the Church of England, and insisted that his movement was well within yet bounds of the Anglican Church.

John Wesley was born in Epworth, England 23 miles (37 km) north west of Lincoln., the son of Samuel Wesley, a graduate of Oxford, and minister of the Church of England. At the age of five, John was rescued from the burning rectory. This escape made deep impression on his mind, and he regarded himself as proventially set apart, as a "brand plucked from burning". In 1869 Samuel married Susanna Annesley. Both Samuel and Susanna had been raised in Disseling.
In 1696 Samuel Welsey was appointed rector of Epworth, where John, the fifteenth child, was born. The Wesley children's early education was given by their parents in the Epworth rector. Each child including the girls, was taught to read as they can could walk, and talk. John was admitted to Charterhouse School, London, when he lived the stations methodical and (for a while) religious life in which he had been trained at here. During his early youth, John Wesley had an a deep religious experience. His biographer, Tyerman, says that he went to Charterhouse a saint, but he became negelient of religious duties and left a sinner.

In June 1720, Wesley entered Christ Church, Oxford, with an annual allowance of 40 pound as Charterhouse scholar. His health was poor and it hard to keep out of debt.A scheme of study which he drew up for 1721 with a time-table for each day of the week is still to be seen in his earlist diary. This first diary thus from April 15. 1725, to February 12, 1727. A Friend describes Wesley at this god humor. He was reading of William Law's Christian Perfektion and Serious call gave him, he said, I note sublience view of the law God: and he resoled to keep it, inwardly and outwardly, as sacredly as possible.

Wesley travelled constantly, usually on horseback. He examined and sent out preachers, began aid charities, prescribed for the sick, helped the use of electric shock for the treatment of illness.

His Aldergate Street London 1n 1738, in which he heard a reading of Luther's preface to Epistle to the Romans, and penned the new famous lines"I felt my heart strangely warmed", revolutionized the character and method of his ministry Wesley wrote many books about Scripture and the Christian life. John Wesley's brother Charles Wesley helped him with many hymns he wrote.

<doc id="37989" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37989" title="Continuity">
Continuity

Continuity is a word used when talking about art, especially "serial art". Serial art is when an artist paints several pictures which all have something to do with each other. 

The six Star Wars films tell one long story which "continues" from part to part. This is where the word "continuity" comes from. Continuity refers to consistency from part to part-- that is, everything should fit together like one whole piece.

At the end of the Star Wars film The Empire Strikes Back, Luke Skywalker loses one of his hands. In the next film, Return of the Jedi, he has a fake hand to replace the one he lost. If he had his real hand again, it wouldn't make sense. The audience would say, did not he lose his hand in the last one? Continuity is making sure things make sense.

Sometimes the word is used to refer to any work of art, like just one film. For example, a woman has a full glass of wine in one shot. In the next shot, the wine is gone. In a third shot, she has a full glass of wine again. That scene would have very poor continuity: it does not make sense, and it reminds the audience that they are watching a movie. Poor continuity is continuity that does not make sense and usually has mistakes.

In American comic books, many different characters live in the same world. For example, Superman and Aquaman live in the same world. But if Superman goes to Atlantis and it's different than Aquaman's Atlantis, it does not make sense. If they are in the same world, Atlantis should be the same no matter who visits it.

Making sure that all the different stories and characters fit together is working with continuity. Sometimes, the word is used to talk about the stories themselves.

Most skinks can only grow to be 12cm long. Some can grow to be 35cm.

Many skinks are carnivorous, which means they eat meat. Some types of skinks eat both plants and meat, making them omnivores, or things that eat both plants and meat.

<doc id="37995" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37995" title="Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis">
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, sometimes called Lou Gehrig’s disease or motor neurone disease) is a chronic, progressive, almost always fatal neurological disease. ALS is marked by slow but steady death of the nerve cells in the central nervous system that control voluntary muscle movement. That is, people with ALS can no longer move, but their heart still beats. The disorder causes muscle weakness and muscle shrinking (atrophy) throughout the body. In ALS, both the upper motor neurons and the lower motor neurons die, making them stop sending messages to the muscles. Unable to function, the muscles gradually weaken and waste away (atrophy). Eventually, the ability of the brain to start and control voluntary movement is lost. However, even patients in later stages of the disease may still have the same intelligence, memory, and personality they had before it started.

ALS does not show many symptoms, making it very hard to diagnose. It usually affects people ages 40-60. The earliest symptoms may include twitching, cramping, or stiffness of muscles; muscle weakness affecting an arm or a leg; slurred and strange-sounding nasal speech; or having a difficult time chewing or swallowing. These general symptoms then develop into clear weakness or atrophy that may cause a physician to believe that a person has ALS.

The parts of the body affected by early symptoms of ALS depend on which muscles in the body are affected first. About 75% of people have limb onset ALS. In some of these cases, symptoms first affect one of the legs, and patients have awkwardness when walking or running or they notice that they are tripping or stumbling more often. Other limb onset patients first see the effects of the disease on a hand or arm as they have a difficult time with simple tasks requiring hand dexterity, or ability to move small things, such as buttoning a shirt, writing, or turning a key in a lock.

About 25% of cases are bulbar onset ALS. These patients first have difficulty speaking clearly. Speech becomes hard to understand and slurred. Speaking through the nose and softer talking are often the first symptoms. Difficulty swallowing, and loss of tongue movement follow. Eventually total loss of speech and ability to keep the airway clear when swallowing are experienced.

No cure has been found for ALS. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first drug treatment for the disease: Riluzole (Rilutek). Riluzole is believed to make damage smaller to motor neurons by decreasing the release of glutamate, a substance that is found in most ALS patients. Clinical trials with ALS patients showed that riluzole gives a better chance of survival by several months, mainly in those with a hard time swallowing. The drug also allows more time before a patient needs breathing help. Riluzole does not heal the damage already done to motor neurons, and patients taking the drug must be watched for liver damage and other side-effects. However, this first ALS therapy offers hope that the assault of ALS may one day be slowed by new medications or combinations of drugs.

Other treatments for ALS are designed to make symptoms less painful and improve the quality of life for patients. This care is best given by teams of health care professionals such as physicians; pharmacists; physical, occupational, and speech therapists; nutritionists; social workers; and home care and hospice nurses. Working with patients and people who take care of the patient, these teams can make a personalized plan of medical and physical therapy and give special equipment that can be used to keep patients as mobile and comfortable as possible.

Fields Medal

The Fields Medal is a prize given to two, three, or four people who study math who are not over 40 years of age at each International Congress of the International Mathematical Union, a meeting that takes place every four years. 

The Canadian mathematician John Charles Fields was the first to propose this medal and it was first awarded in 1936. It has been regularly awarded since 1950. Its purpose is to give recognition and support to younger mathematical researchers who have made major contributions. 

The Fields Medal is viewed, at least in the media, as the top honor a mathematician can receive. It comes with a monetary award, which in 2006 was C$15,000 (US$13,400 or €10,550).

Because of its prestige, the Fields Medal is often described as the "Nobel Prize of mathematics,", but the comparison is not so good. First, it is awarded not only to recognize the valuable contributions of a mathematician but also to encourage him or her to continue his work. The Fields Medals have generally been awarded for a mathematician's whole work, rather than for a particular result. 

Another difference is that the Fields Medal is awarded every four years, and its recipients cannot be over the age of 40. Also, the money awarded with the medal is much lower than the US$1.3 million given with each Nobel prize.

A laugh is a way of showing happiness. It is a noise that a person makes when he hears something funny, like a joke, or a tickle.

Sometimes people laugh when they are not happy. When people are ashamed or embarrassed, sometimes they react by laughing.

There are different ways to laugh. A person can laugh using mostly their voice, mostly their throat, or mostly their nose.

You can write a laugh in different ways. Some people write "ha ha ha", or "he he he", or "hehe". If they are on the internet, they also use "LOL". "LOL" does not sound like a laugh, but it stands for Laughing Out Loud.

Laughter can be observed in human babies from around three or four months and is usually an expression of surprise. Babies' laughter often produces a positive response in adults who will involuntarily copy the child. Video footage, on the YouTube site, of babies laughing was shown to Queen Elizabeth II during her visit, on 16 October 2008, to the Google headquarters, where both she and her husband the Duke of Edinburgh were reduced to 'fits of giggles'.

Beaver

A beaver is a kind of rodent. It is "semi-aquatic", meaning some of the time it lives in water, some of the time it lives on land. Beavers can only be found in North America and Europe. In Europe, they almost became extinct (died off), but they are returning. There are beavers living in the Elbe and Rhone rivers, as well as in Bavaria, Poland and Scandinavia. 
Beavers are known for building and keeping dams in rivers.

Currently there are two different species of beaver, the American beaver ("C. canadensis") and the European beaver ("C. fiber").

This beaver can be found in North America, in Canada, the United States and in Northern Mexico. It is the second largest rodent in the world, and the largest found in North America. The largest rodent of the world is the capybara from South America. 

The European beaver is currently an endangered species. It was hunted almost to extinction. This was done because of its fur, and because of castoreum. Castoreum is made by a certain gland, which is also responsible for the smell of the animal.. People are currently (2007) reintroducing the beaver, because the important role of the beaver for the ecology of rivers was discovered. Beaver dams (or the small lakes that form) provide a habitat for many species.

Early visitors that met Indians saw them wearing animal skin blankets. The fur on these blankets were good for felting. The Europeans wanted felt hats, and the Indians wanted metal: so, fur trading began.

Beaver was the most popular fur for hats. At that time in North America, there were about sixty million beavers. Only the soft inside fur was used for felting. The best time for collecting the beaver's fur was winter, when the fur was thickest. It was also a good time to hunt, since the beaver stayed close to its home in the winter and was easy to catch. The fur trade gave more money to the European traders more than the Indians. The traders made lots of money on the furs they collected; the Indians got the metal tools and pots and beads they wanted, but it cost them their way of life and their land.

The bladder is an organ in the human body. All the liquids that are drunk go through the bladder. The bladder takes in the liquid in order for the body to work. The bladder works with the kidneys. The kidneys clean the liquid we drink. This goes on till the bladder is too full to hold any more. At this point, it is roughly the size of a softball. The bladder then tells the brain that it needs to be emptied. Once this message is received to the brain, the muscles around the bladder start to squeeze and the bladder starts to contract. At the same time the bladder sends a message to the sphincters to relax and let the liquid pass.

Time travel

Time travel is the idea of going back in time to the past or forward to the future. Time travel can not be done with the technology we have now. Still, scientists like physicists say that there's a chance that time travel will be possible in the future.

Light moves very fast, faster than anything else in the universe. The speed of light is very high: 670,616,629 miles in one hour. Most cars can only travel about 100 miles in one hour, and most people can only run 12 miles in one hour. As you can see, the speed of light is much faster than cars or people. 

Scientists say that the closer you get to the speed of light, the slower time moves for you. To give an example, if you went into a rocket ship and flew through space at the speed of light for one day, by the time you came back, it's possible that a whole year could have passed! Albert Einstein was famous for his ideas on time.

Science fiction and fantasy movies and TV shows have been based on stories of people who travel through time. For example the US movie "Back to the Future" tells a made-up story about a professor who builds a machine that can take people into the future or back in the past. The popular British TV show Doctor Who is about an alien who has adventures by time traveling.

Another example of a made-up story about time travel is in "Charmed", but instead of using machines and science, they use magic to go to specific times and places.

Psalms (Hebrew "Tehillim" תְהִלִּים, or "praises") is a book of 150 Hebrew poems in the Bible. The Book of Psalms is part of the Hebrew Bible or Tanakh, and it is also in the Old Testament of the Christian translations. People traditionally believe that many of the Psalms in the Bible were written by King David to God. Perhaps the most famous one is Psalm 23, which starts "The LORD is my shepherd". Psalm 23 is often used for funerals.

There are 150 Psalms in the Biblical canon of Jews, Protestants, and Catholics, but there are also more poems that these religions do not think are holy. Psalm 151 is part of canon of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

The names "Psalms" and "Psalter" come from the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament). There, they were about stringed instruments (for example, the harp, lyre and lute), then to songs sung with them. The traditional Hebrew title is "tehillim". "Tehillim" means "praises", though many of the psalms are "tephillot" ("prayers"). One of the first collections in the book was titled "the prayers of David son of Jesse" (72:20, NIV).

The Psalter is poetry, though it has many prayers and not all Old Testament prayers were poetic. In fact, not all praise was poetic either. The Psalms are full of images, comparisons and metaphor. The Hebrew text often plays with words and repeats the same words, adding synonyms (words with the same meaning) to fill out the description. Important words show the main themes in the prayer or song.

Graphite

Graphite, like diamond, is an allotrope of carbon. They are very similar to each other but the structure of the atom affects the chemical and physical properties. Graphite is made of layers of carbon atoms. These layers can slide over each other very easily. This means that it is very soft. It is a dull gray in appearance. Due to the delocalized electrons between the layers, it can conduct electricity very well.

Graphite can be formed from coal put under high heat and pressure. Also, graphite can be turned into diamond with enough heat and pressure. This is how synthetic (man-made) diamonds are made.

Graphite is naturally found in Sri Lanka,Canada and the United States. It is also called Lead Black. It was named by Abraham Gottlob Werner in 1789 originating from the Greek language.

It can be used as a lubricant to make mechanical devices run smoother. The most common use of graphite is the "lead" in a pencil, which also has clay.

<doc id="38073" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38073" title="Covalent bond">
Covalent bond

Covalent bonds are chemical bonds between two non-metal atoms . An example is water, where hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) bond together to make (HO). As they are both non-metals—which need to gain electrons—they have to share, so their outer shells cross over in order to have a full outer shell. A full outer shell has eight electrons. The electrons in this outer shell are called valence electrons. 

The number of valence electrons is decided by the size of the atom. Electrons orbit an atomic nucleus in in the same kind of way that planets orbit stars. There are layers of paths around an atomic nucleus. The first layer always contains only two electrons, while the layers after that usually contain up to eight. 

For example, if an atom contained eight total electrons, the first two would orbit very close to the nucleus, the next 6 would orbit a little farther away. Every atom wants a "full" outer shell. That is to say, it wants the number of electrons in the outer-most layer to be as high as they can be. Since most atoms' outer shells can support up to eight electrons, this is the number of electrons most atoms want in their outer shell. In this example, the atom had eight total electrons, and six in the outer shell. Since there are fewer than eight electrons in the outer shell, the atom will want to "fill" the places for two electrons with electrons borrowed from another atom. When an atom "borrows" electrons with another atom, a covalent bond is formed.

With water the oxygen atom shares one electron with each hydrogen atom and the hydrogens also share one: this means that the hydrogen atoms have two each and the oxygen atom has eight.

Covalent bonds are weaker than ionic bonds, and have a lower melting point. They are also thought to be poor conductors of electricity.

Intelligence

Intelligence is a property of the mind. People do not agree on what intelligence is, exactly. The idea comes from Latin "intelligo". A part of intelligence allows people to solve problems. These problems may be easy to solve. They may also be hard to solve, and involve abstract thought. 

If a solution is found to a problem, it can be remembered. That way, the problem is solved more quickly when it comes up again. That is what is called learning.

There is disagreement about what has more impact on intelligence, genetics or environment.

Some people say that intelligence can be tested. An intelligence test for them would be solving many problems in a very short time. Most of the problems have to do with seeing things, or telling what a rotated shape will look like. Some are also related to mathematics, for example to tell what number is next. Other tests have to do with words. After doing such a test, they will then calculate a number they call Intelligence Quotient (IQ). Since most of the words on these tests have to do with Latin, some people say that an Intelligence Quotient only measures how much a person has learned Latin. People in other parts of the world have very different ideas about the mind.
Some people try to build machines that try to act as if they were intelligent. That is related to Computer science and is called Artificial intelligence (man-made "intelligence" that is not real).

Some say that intelligent behaviour is when an organism (a living thing) reacts enough to a stimulus.

Go Fish is a game with playing cards. 2 to 10 people can play.

Every player gets five cards. The rest of the cards (the deck) are put face down where all the players can get them. Cards that are the same color and the same number are called pairs. If a player has a pair, they put it face up in front of them so everybody can see it. The player to the left of the player who gave everybody their cards goes first. When it is a player's turn, they ask another player for a card that is the same color and number as one they already have. They can ask any player. If the other player has the card, they give it to the one that asked, and the one that asked puts the pair in front of them and gets to go again. If the other player does not have the card, then they say, "Go Fish," and the player that asked takes a card from the deck and the next player goes. If a player has no cards when it is time for him to go, then he just takes a card from the deck and the next player goes. If there are no cards in the deck and the player has no cards, then that player does not get to go. The game ends when all the cards are face up in pairs. The winner is the player with the most pairs.

<doc id="38118" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38118" title="Pollination">
Pollination

Pollination is part of sexual reproduction in plants. It describes the pollen grains getting to the female parts of a plant. Pollen grains, which contain the male gametes (sperm), need to get to where the female gamete(s) are. 

What happens is basically the same as sexual reproduction in animals. Each pollen grain is haploid: it has half of the DNA (genetic information) that is needed to make a new plant. During fertilization this combines with the DNA that is in the egg of the female part and a zygote is formed. In seed plants a seed is started.

In flowering plants, pollen has to get from one flower to another. There are two main ways that this can happen: by non-living things like wind or water, or by living things such as insects or birds.

Maize (called corn in some parts of the world) is pollinated by wind. The male anthers let go of their pollen and it blows over to a nearby female flower on another corn plant. Most of the flowers are either male or female on a corn plant (monoecious), rather than both sexes in one flower (hermaphrodite).

Maize flowers have evolved (changed over time) to use wind for pollination. They do not need pretty petals. The pollen is light so it can blow around, and the ends of the female parts (stigma) are fluffy to catch all the tiny pollen grains.

Tomato plants need bees to move the pollen from the male parts of one flower (anthers), to the female parts of another flower (stigma). The bee moves between flowers, not because it is feeling helpful, but because it needs to collect the sweet nectar that the flowers have on offer. The bees take the nectar home to their hive to make honey and the tomato plants get to reproduce (make new tomato plants).

Because the tomato flowers have evolved to attract bees, they have spread-out petals and are white to human eyes (bees, like most insects, can see into the ultraviolet range as well as our visual range of wavelengths). The pollen is often stuck together in clumps called "pollinia", which in turn get stuck to the bee. Bees are extremely hairy, and carry tiny electric charges which attract the pollen onto their bodies. Honey bees have special pollen baskets, usually on their rear legs; they groom the pollen off their bodies into these pockets. 

Much of the pollen gets taken back to the nest or hive, where it is used as a source of protein, most needed by the larvae. Some gets rubbed off on the next flower, where the female stigma is sticky. A pollen tube grows down to permit the male gamete to fertilize an egg and make a seed.

80% of plants are pollinated by living things, and only 20% use abiotic (non-living) pollination. Of these abiotic pollinations, 98% is done by wind and just 2% by water.

Gull

Gulls, also called seagulls, are birds. They form the family Laridae, in the order Charadriiformes.

There are many different types of gull but most of them are white, with grey or black wings, a yellow beak and are about the size of a chicken (but some are smaller). Gulls can eat most types of food but like meat more than anything else. They look around for discarded food and dead animals to eat as well as hunting and have learned how to live and breed in the same places as people. Most types of seagull are awake during the day and sleep at night. They like to sleep on water, like lakes or the sea when the water is calm.

Gulls used to be found only near the sea, as they are water birds with webbed feet for swimming. They are more common inland these days because they can find food wherever people live, often on garbage dumps or in the streets of towns and cities. Seagulls are intelligent compared to other birds and have a very complicated system of noises and body movements that they use to talk to other seagulls.

Most types of seagull breed once a year and have two or three chicks (babies). Mother gulls are very protective of their eggs and chicks and will sometimes fight to the death to defend them.

Gulls are not usually eaten by people.

World music is a term which is used in Western countries to describe traditional music or folk music from many different parts of the world. This music is sung or played by people who live in the area. World music can be anything from a short song to a long Indian raga.

Not everybody likes the term "world music". People in some parts of the world think that, when people talk about "world music" they are thinking that it is simple or primitive. However, this is certainly not the case, because world music may often have very complicated rhythms or use pitches which are far mor complex than those in traditional western "composed" music.

This genre of music is increasingly emerging in popular culture, as heard in the Sony PlayStation 2 video game, "FIFA 07", which is a soccer game that features many modes of difficulty from amateur to legendary status. Soccer fans are most likely to be world beat listeners while NASCAR fans are most likely to listen to either country music and/or rock and roll music.

The domestic goat ("Capra hircus" or "Capra aegagrus hircus") is a domesticated mammal. It comes from the Wild Goat.

A male goat is called a "buck" and a castrated goat is called a "whether", a female is called a "doe". Young goats are called "kids".

People eat their meat, drink their milk, and use their fur and skin. With goat milk, cheese can be made, along with other dairy products. Some farmers use goats to eat plants the farmers do not want, called weeds. Other times, the goats are used to keep grasses and other plants from getting too tall. 
The domestic goat has cloven hooves, a long beard on its chin, a short tail that turns up, and horns that grow up from the head in an arc. The hair is straight with a woolly coat under it during winter.

The domestic goat is about 70-120 cm (28-48 inches). They weigh from 45-54 kg (100-120 lb.).

The diet of the domestic goat includes eating grass, trees, shrubs, bushes, and many other kinds of plants. If domestic goats are allowed to eat in one place, they would eat off almost all the plants on the land.

Domestic goats are smart and active. They enjoy playing and climbing. They are social animals that live in a herd.

Domestic sheep

A domestic sheep ("Ovis aries") is a domesticated mammal related to wild sheep and goats. It is a type of cattle, and is owned and looked after by a sheep farmer. Female sheep are called "ewes". Male sheep are called "rams". Young are called "lambs". 

They are kept for their wool and their meat. The wool of sheep, after cleaning and treating, is used to make woollen clothes. The meat of young sheep is called "lamb", and the meat from adult sheep is called "mutton". Both are economically important products which have been used since prehistoric times.

Sheep are domesticated animals which have been bred by man. There are breeds which specialise in wool or meat.

The plural of 'Sheep' is just 'Sheep'. It is not 'Sheeps'.

A group of sheep is called a flock. Sheep follow each other in basically the same way all the time, so there are special names for the different roles sheep play in a flock. The sheep that is farthest away from the others is called the outlier, a word that is also used in statistics. This sheep is willing to go out farther away from the safety of the flock to graze, but takes a chance that a predator like a wolf will attack it first, because it is alone. Another sheep, the bellwether, which never goes first but always follows an outlier, is the one that signals to the others that it is safe to go that way. When it moves, the others will also move. Tendency to be outliers or to be bellwethers, or stick in the middle of the flock, seems to stay with a sheep its whole life. There might be genes that make them repeat this role behaviour.

Probably the most famous sheep was Dolly the Sheep. She was named after Dolly Parton, and was the first large mammal clone. She did not live as long as a regular sheep, because clones have health problems. This is only known because of Dolly. 

These sheep are so named because they can store large amounts of fat in the tail and the region of the rump. They are kept mainly because they make more milk than other types of sheep; but their wool is rough and long, and is mostly used for making carpets. Fat-tailed sheep are found mainly in the very dry parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, and they represent about 25 percent of the sheep in the world. The major breeds are the Awassi, Bakhtiari, Karakul, Ghashghai, and Kermani.

People may be called "sheep" if they follow a leader without thinking. This is what is called a "figurative" meaning: it's a figure of speech.

Richard Sharpe

Major Richard Sharpe is a fictional character. He is the main character in a series of books written by Bernard Cornwell. Many of the books have been made into television movies, where the stories were told in a different order from the books. Sharpe's story is set during the Napoleonic Wars. Sharpe has a series of "sword waving" adventures.

So far, the writer has written 21 books, from "Sharpe's Tiger" to "Sharpe's Devil". The first book is set in the year 1799, while the last is set in the years 1820 to 1821. There were also three short stories set between other books. All the stories cover the Napoleonic Wars, as well as a prelude in India detailing Sharpe's rise to the rank of Ensign. The final book looks at Sharpe on a mission to rescue his old friend, the Spanish Captain General Don Blas Vivar, in Chile.

Here is the order of the books and short stories, with the year the story is set:
Born in London to a poor mother, Sharpe spent most of his youth in the inner city of London. When he killed someone, he went away to Yorkshire. He then joined a British line battalion, a regiment in the British Army. He was sent to India, where he saved the Duke of Wellington's life. For this, he was given a field commission to the rank of Lieutenant. He was then transferred to a Highland regiment, where he was not wanted, and was transferred into the 95th Rifles at Shorncliffe back in England. The 95th Rifles was then sent to northern Spain with General Moore's army. It was in Spain that he became friends with Patrick Harper.

In the latest adventure "Sharpe's Challenge", Sharpe and Harper go to India to fight some villains.

<doc id="38263" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38263" title="Ballroom dance">
Ballroom dance

Ballroom dance is the name for a number of dances done in ballrooms. It usually means pairs (mostly a man and woman) dancing separately from other pairs. The most important difference in style is between the modern or standard dances and the latin dances. The modern dances are the waltz, quickstep, foxtrot, tango and Viennese waltz. The latin dances are the cha-cha-cha, samba, rumba, paso doble and jive. However, there are also sequence dances, where dancers move together in a pre-set pattern. 

All these dances can be danced socially, more or less any way people want to. As competition dances, they are organised under the rule of the World Dance Council. These competitions are danced in the "International style"; the techniques were developed by English dancers in the 20th century. All major international competitions are conducted within detailed regulations. There are other systems of dance regulated by national bodies. American style is one; Scottish dancing is another; Greek classical dance is another. 

Although the most famous dancers were Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, they did not dance in ballrooms. Their career together was entirely on film. Astair danced also on the stage, and on television. The most famous American pair of ballroom dancers was Vernon and Irene Castle, who were national figures until Vernon's death in 1918. Later, Arthur Murray's chain of dance schools taught many Americans to dance. The most famous English ballroom dancer was probably Victor Silvester, who was a professional dancer and a very successful bandleader.

There are ten international style ballroom dances, five "standard" (or "modern") and five "Latin:"



Most of these are dances that started in other places, but were developed in their modern form by English dancers and dance teachers.

Most people do these dances for fun. When people compete against each other, the women wear formal dresses (gowns) for standard competition and short skirts for Latin. Men wear formal evening wear ('white tie and tails') for standard and informal shirts for Latin.
Some people earn medals to show how they are improving. They dance in front of a judge to earn a medal at the Bronze, Silver, or Gold levels. Ballroom dance teaching and medal awards is done by Dance Teacher organisations, such as the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD) or the International Dance Teachers Association (IDTA). These organisations also do ballet, stage dancing (or 'theatre dance' or 'jazz dance') and several other types of dance. Their qualifications and exams are held world-wide, even though they are English in origin. Street dance, as the name suggests, does not need a ballroom. Nevertheless, it is being taught in ballrooms, as are some other kinds of non-traditional dance.

There are also some line dances, in which people dance as a group instead of with a partner. Some line dances are done to Mambo, Waltz, Paso Doble, and Samba.

Some people dance in couples, but also as a group, with everyone doing the same steps. This is called "formation dancing".

People compete at many levels, but the basic division is between amateurs and professionals. Then, amongst amateurs, there are ages grades (British regulations):
In the USA, competitions may be divided according to dancing ability: Newcomer, Pre-Bronze, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Pre-Championship, and Championship. 

The best-known competition is the Blackpool Dance Festival, England. This has been going annually since 1920 (except for war years), and its events, like most English events, are open to the world.

American style ballroom dancing is sometimes called Social style. It includes "smooth" and "rhythm" dances:

Wormhole

A wormhole is a shortcut through time and space. It is not known if wormholes exist in nature. Scientists believe that if wormholes existed they could not be made following any traditional scientific methods. In order to hold a wormhole open, a form of theoretical exotic matter would be needed. Otherwise the wormhole would simply disappear very quickly after its creation. If plotted on a 2-dimensional plane, the wormhole bends the plane, like folding a paper, so that the two ends would be touching. (as seen in the picture). The term wormhole was first used by John Wheeler, a theoretical physicist.

The strings supply bounce to hit the ball. The handle and frame of the racquet is usually made out of light materials such as graphite. Older racquets were made out of wood. Tennis racquets come in different sizes and weights.

Tennis racquets can be bought at sports equipment stores or department stores. A beginner racquet can cost as little as $30, but they can cost much more for very good quality rackets ($500 or more).

Secondary school

Secondary school is the next step up from primary school. Secondary school is also commonly known as high school.

In Australia a person will generally start secondary school when they are at the age of twelve and finish when they are either 16 or 18, depending on whether they finish with years 11 and 12. In secondary school a person will advance through the year levels (or grades) each year.

In the United Kingdom, a person generally starts secondary school at age 11 and finish at either 16 or 18 depending on whether the secondary school has a sixth form offering post 16 education.

Generally there are five to six years of high school. The first year of high school is normally either grade 7 or 8, and then proceeds on to year 10 or 12.

In some schools in Australia years 11 and 12 are just a normal part of high school. Though some other schools may only progress through to year 10, in this case students will then go to college (years 11 and 12).

At the end of secondary school, students will usually take a unified examination. For example, students finishing secondary school in England take the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE).

Lutheranism

Lutheranism is a denomination within the Christian religion.

The person who led the Lutherans in their separation from the Catholic Church was Martin Luther. Martin Luther began this separation from the Catholic Church in the 16th century. Luther was a German priest, theologian, and university professor in Wittenberg. He worked to improve the practices of the Roman Catholic Church.

Lutheranism happened when Martin Luther and his followers separated from the Roman Catholic Church. This overall movement is known as the Protestant Reformation. Luther’s ideas helped begin the Protestant Reformation. Other church leaders who separated from the Roman Catholic Church agreed with Luther on some things and disagreed with him on other things (see John Calvin and Ulrich Zwingli).

Lutherans believe the Bible is the first and best source for Christian faith and teaching. Like other Christians, they believe in the Trinity, that Jesus Christ was both God and man, that all humans are sinful since Adam and Eve (see Original sin), and that humans are saved by Jesus' death on the cross. Lutherans believe that the central idea to all of their beliefs is that we are saved by grace through faith because of Jesus Christ (see Justification). The main points of Lutheran theology were summed up in 1530 by Philip Melanchthon in the writing called The Augsburg Confession.

Plow

A plow or plough is a simple machine used in farming. A plow is pulled across the ground by a human or animal. When pulled across the ground, the plow lifts up dirt and makes two lines of dirt behind it. The dirt lifted by the plow is more loose than before. Ground that has been plowed is a good place for a farmer to grow food.

When agriculture was first made simple hand-held digging sticks or hoes would have been used in areas with good soil, such as the area near the Nile River in Africa. At the Nile, the annual flood makes the soil better by "rejuvenating" it, to create places where seeds could be planted. To help crops grow in areas where floods were rare, the soil had to be rejuvenated in a different way. This is when plowing was first used, and hoes were the first plows.

Madeline

Madeline is a popular children’s book series. It was written by American author Ludwig Bemelmans. The first book in the series, "Madeline", was published in 1939. The book was very successful. In the 1940s and 1950s, Bemelmans wrote many more sequels to the original. Bemelman’s grandson, John Bemelmans-Mariano, writes the series of books to this day. There are 16 Madeline books. The books were later made into a television series and a movie.

The books and the television show describe the adventures of Madeline's life in the late 1940s in France. Madeline is the smallest and youngest girl at her school. She is also the liveliest and the most popular. Madeline is not afraid of anything. She laughs at tigers in the zoo and taunts bullies. She even runs away to join a circus. She is also a very kind friend to the rest of the children at her school, and never loses her smile. Madeline attends a convent school in the heart of France with eleven other students. They leave the house at half past nine every morning in rain or shine. Miss Clavel is their teacher and a nun. The girls of her school mean more to her than anything. Miss Clavel is worried about Madeline because she is an orphan and has no family.

Although Madeline is set in France, with French accents, it is very popular all over the world, especially in the United States and in the Philippines, where a Filipino version was aired in the TV station ABS-CBN. Madeline has many Internet pages including an official website and fan club.

Professional

A professional is someone who has a job for which they need a college or university education. Doctors, lawyers, teachers: these are all people in professional occupations (jobs). They may often get paid more than other people, but this is not necessarily the case. In sport, a professional is someone who is paid to play. For example, Tiger Woods and David Beckham are professional sportsmen.

The word "professional" is often used as an adjective, e.g.
The opposite of "professional" in this sense is: "unprofessional".

Another word that is the opposite of "professional" is "amateur". This means that someone does not get paid for the job he is doing (even if he may be doing it very well).

<doc id="38314" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38314" title="Apartment">
Apartment

An apartment (or flat in Britain and most other Commonwealth countries) is a building where people pay the owner money in order to live there. The owner of the apartment is called the landlord and the people who live in the apartment are called the tenants. The money that the tenants pay in order to live there is called the rent or the rent money. "Rent" also means to pay to live in an apartment; the tenant "rents" the apartment from the landlord.

An apartment building has many apartments in it. In an apartment building, each apartment is a separate room or set of rooms for people to live in. Sometimes an apartment will only be one small room, and tenants will have to share other rooms like the bathroom and kitchen. Other times, tenants will only share an entrance and a hallway with doors that go to many apartments.

An apartment complex is a group of apartment buildings. In an apartment complex, all of the apartment buildings are made in a similar way.

In many apartments, the tenants only pay the landlord for renting the apartment, and they have to pay other people to provide utilities like electricity and heat. In some apartments, especially the ones in apartment complexes, the tenants will have to pay more to rent the apartment, but in return the landlord will give them things like utilities, laundry rooms (where people wash their clothing), exercise rooms, and parking spaces for the tenant's car. Many people like this because it means they do not have to keep track of as many bills every month.

Apartment buildings are more common in cities than single apartments or houses, because there is less room in a city to fit buildings. Building a house for one family in a dense city would cost an enormous amount of money compared to building a house outside of a city.

The show first aired on The WB network and moved to the CW network when the WB merged with UPN.

"Gilmore Girls" was a one hour drama. It had very witty storylines that explored family, generational divides, love, and friendship. It had the makings of a comedy because of the fast paced dialogue, the wild references and sense of humour that was in the program.

Nasal cavity

The Nasal cavity is the inside of your nose

The nasal cavity is divided into a right and left passageway. The tissue that covers the wall of your nasal cavity contains many blood vessels. Heat from the blood in the vessels helps warm the air as you breath. Moisture is added to the air you breath by special cells in the walls of the nasal cavity. The air is warmed and moistened before it reaches your lungs.
Cilia (small hairs) and mucus along the inside wall of the nasal cavity trap and remove dust and germs from the air as it flows through the nasal cavity. The cilia move the mucus down the nasal cavity to the pharynx, where it can be swallowed.
The nasal cavity is covered by the nasal bone above and by the maxilla and ethmoid bone on the sides. The top of the inside of the mouth separates the nasal cavity from the mouth. 
The nasal cavity is divided in two by a vertical fin called the nasal septum. On the sides of the nasal cavity are three horizontal outgrowths called turbinates. These turbinates guide the air through the nasal cavity. The vomeronasal organ is found at the back of the septum and has a role in finding pheromones.

Diseases of the nasal cavity include viral infections and nasal cavity cancer. Picking your nose can lead to bloody noses as well.

Juice

Juice is a liquid that comes from plants, animals or fruit. The juice from fruit is often made into a drink. Some juices that are often made into drinks are apple, orange, tomato, pineapple, grapefruit, guava, mango, passionfruit, tropical, carrot, watermelon, cranberry, grape, lemon and lime, but there are many others.

In the United Kingdom the name of a fruit or fruits followed by "juice" can only legally be used to describe something which is 100% fruit juice. This is because of the Fruit Juices and Fruit Nectars (England) Regulations and the Fruit Juices & Fruit Nectars (Scotland) Regulations 2003.

Juice can be bought from a store, already in bottles. Companies sell fruit juice just like any other drink. Juices are made by squeezing the juice out of the fruit.

If something has a lot of juice in it, it is said to be juicy. Juice does not have to be a drink. It can just be a liquid contained in something.

<doc id="38328" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38328" title="Subtropical cyclone">
Subtropical cyclone

A subtropical cyclone (also known as a subtropical storm) is a cyclonic weather storm. Subtropical cyclones have wide wind patterns with the winds getting stronger as they get farther away from the centre of the storm.

A subtropical cyclone is more likely to be a tropical cyclone than an extratropical cyclone. Subtropical cyclones are only found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Like normal tropical cyclones, most subtropical cyclones have maximum wind speeds of at least 39 mph to 74 mph (60 km/h to 110 km/h). Subtropical cyclones that have wind speeds less than 39 mph are known as "subtropical depressions".

During the 1950s and 60s, subtropical cyclones were simply called "semi-tropical". There was much discussion between meteorologists in the late 1960s as of what a subtropical cyclone was. So, in 1972, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) officially classified the word under a new category, different from actual tropical cyclones. During the 1970s, the NHC began making a new list of names, separate for subtropical cyclones, although that process was soon canceled because it was rejected by many scientists. After that, subtropical storms were just numbered, such as Hurricane Karen from 2001 which was originally named "Subtropical Storm One". But on 2002, a policy change had tropical and subtropical storms share the same list of names for the whole season, which started with Subtropical Storm Nicole in 2004.

In the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, the NHC monitored the first named subtropical cyclone, its name was Subtropical Storm Nicole. Later, another unnamed subtropical cyclone was discovered in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season after someone re-read the records. Although it could have been named, the subtropical storm remained without a name because the time of the discovery happened a long time after the official season had finished. A third subtropical cyclone was named Subtropical Storm Andrea which formed on May 9 just before the start of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season.

A subtropical cyclone can form in many ways:


The most common type of a subtropical cycle is an upper-level cold low with circulation expanding to the surface layer and strongest winds usually happening at a radius of about 100 miles/160 kilometers or more from the center.

Another type of a subtropical cyclone is a mesoscale low forming in or near an area of horizontal wind shear, also known as a "dying frontal zone", with radius of strongest winds normally less than 30 miles (50 kilometers). The entire circulation may originally have a diameter of less than 100 miles/160 kilometres. These cyclones usually last for a short time. They may be either cold core or warm core, and for some time in 1972 this type of subtropical cyclone was called as a "neutercane". As of 2006, the warm core type was moved under the definition of the term, tropical cyclone; and removed from the subtropical cyclone definition.

Morning

Morning is the time of day from 12:00 AM to 12 PM. Morning is usually cooler than afternoon. Many people say it is not morning until they wake up. This is wrong because morning starts at 12:00 AM (midnight).

Many people use the morning as a time to get ready for the day. This includes things like taking a shower, eating a meal (called breakfast, because you break the fast of the night) and getting dressed. Then, many people go to work or school. 

Many people also buy a morning newspaper to read about what is going on in the world. Many people also find out about the news on the television or the radio.

A popular breakfast dish is scrambled eggs. These can be made (cooked) by putting eggs into a pan with butter and heating. Cereal is also a popular breakfast dish. It can be made by pouring cereal into a bowl with milk or water.

The way these levels are numbered may be different in different countries. In Britain and most of Europe, the ground level floors are called the "ground floor", the next level is called the "first floor". In most of the United States, Russia and China, the floor at ground level is called the "first floor", the next level is called the "second floor".

Okinawa is the name for the islands in the far south of Japan. There are hundreds of small islands in Okinawa. These islands make up Okinawa Prefecture. The capital of Okinawa is Naha. Naha is on the island with the most people, Okinawa island. Okinawa used to be called the Ryukyu islands. 

Many of Okinawa's islands are scenic, and there are many beaches there. 

The temperature in Okinawa is often warm or hot. Many animals make their home around the Okinawa islands. For example, sea turtles, jellyfish, and many kinds of birds all live around Okinawa.

An average person in Okinawa lives to be older than 90. Some people think that is because Okinawan food is healthy. Fish is very popular, but people also eat sea vegetables and pork.

Okinawa's music is popular all over Japan. A musical instrument called a "sanshin" is often used.

Okinawa was the site of the last big battles World War II, the Battle of Okinawa. A lot of Okinawan people died during the battle. Now, the United States has some military bases for soldiers on the different islands of Okinawa.

Okinawa is currently a part of Japan. However, it has its own history and culture distinguished from Japan. The history of Okinawa is usually divided into five eras as follows.

In prehistoric era, hunting animals and collecting plants were mainly prevailing among the people. A shift to farming economy advanced during from 10th to 12th century. Many communities were formed, and integrated into three small countries. In 1372, one of these countries had belonged to Min dynasty, which is one of the dynasties in China. This small country had become strong because of profits from the trade with Min dynasty, then it unified the countries. It is "Ryukyu kingdom". Ryukyu kingdom flourished by trade in Asian whole area, not only with China, during 15th and 16th century.

In 1609, Shimazu invaded Ryukyu kingdom and made it subordinate. Shimazu was the feudal lord, who ruled over one region of Japan, Satsuma-han. "han" means the unit that a feudal lord ruled over. This invasion meant that Ryukyu kingdom had been incorporated in Japanese shogunate regime. This domination continued until the end of the 19th century.

In 1867, Japanese shogunate gave back government to Tenno, who is the Japanese Emperor, Japanese shogunate regime had ended then. The Japanese new government had a policy to incorporate Ryukyu kingdom in the Japanese regime. So, Ryukyu kingdom was reorganized soon. At first, in 1871, Ryukyu kingdom was renamed Ryukyu-han, it meant that Ryukyu was directly controlled by Japan without Satsuma-han. In 1879, It was reorganized as "Okinawa-ken". "Ken" means "prefecture". Ryukyu kingdom was perfectly ruined at that time. Okinawa became a Japanese colony.

At first of colonization, Japan emphasized difference between Okinawan and Japanese culture, because it justified a discriminatory policy in the colony. However, to justify colonization against the Western countries, policies were changed into ones which emphasized similarity of them and assimilated Okinawa into Japan. Thus, Okinawan society had been influenced from Japan more and more. The biggest influence was that Okinawa was rolled up in Japanese war mainly against U.S.A. and China. Okinawa was incorporated into the part of the war system. In the end of the wartime, Okinawa in itself became the battlefield, and the social infrastructure was completely destroyed, and many people died. 

After the war, Okinawa was put under the U.S. military administration. The people expected freedom and democracy, but did not come true to give priority to the U.S. military policy. Therefore, movement in search of administrative authority return to Japan was strengthened, it was carried out in 1972. However, the problem continues up to the present in order that Japanese government gives priority to U.S. military policy afterwards. Many US military bases are still left, and crimes by the US soldiers continue to become the social problem.

Its main campus is at Loyola Heights in Quezon City, Metro Manila. It offers elementary, secondary, undergraduate, and graduate level education. It teaches many things, for example Arts, Humanities, Business, Law, Social Sciences, Theology, and Pure and Applied Sciences.

The Ateneo de Manila University has three campuses in Metro Manila. Several thousand teachers teach students of different ages, from elementary to postgraduate. The Loyola Schools have around 7,500 undergraduate students and around 3,000 graduate students, making the Ateneo small, in number of students, compared to many other Philippine universities.

The University began in 1859 when the City of Manila turned over the Escuela Municipal, a public primary school in Intramuros, to Spanish Jesuits. The school took the name "Ateneo" when it began teaching secondary education in 1865, and it has since grown into a university.

Subtropical Storm Nicole (2004)

Subtropical Storm Nicole was the fourteenth named storm and first subtropical cyclone to form during the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. Additionally, it was the first subtropical storm to be given a name from the standard hurricane naming list and be considered a subtropical cyclone in real-time. The storm never made landfall as a subtropical cyclone, though its remnants affected Anticosti Island, just off of the provinces of Prince Edward Island and Quebec.

Nicole's genesis appeared to be associated with an upper tropospheric trough and a decaying frontal system located over the southwestern North Atlantic in early October. By October 8, a broad area of surface low pressure became evident about 400 miles (640 km) southeast of Bermuda. Shortly thereafter, the system began to produce gale-force winds, affecting Bermuda on October 9. Early the next day, analysis from the National Hurricane Center determined that the low-pressure system had acquired sufficient tropical characteristics to be classified as a subtropical storm, whereupon it was assigned the name "Nicole".

Steadily tracking over cooler waters toward the northwest, Nicole lost all of its tropical characteristics and was declared fully extratropical on October 11, 345 miles (555 km) south-southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The Canadian Hurricane Centre continued to issue advisories on what was referred to as "Post-tropical Storm Nicole", which had subsequently merged with a stronger mid-latitude cyclone. The resultant weather system producing heavy rainfall across the Maritimes in the vicinity of Anticosti Island on October 14.

No damage or fatalities were reported, for that Nicole never made landfall or directly affected any land areas. It brought light rain to Bermuda and briefly threatened it before heading northeast. Its remnants combined with a stronger cyclone affecting Anticosti Island in Canada; however, no significant damage was caused in the area.

Since 2002, subtropical storms have been assigned names from the same naming sequence as tropical storms. As such, Nicole was the first named subtropical storm to receive a name under this rule. Many subtropical cyclones between 1975 and 2001 with a sufficiently tropical nature were either considered fully tropical storms or numbered. Initially, however, the phonetic alphabet was used to name subtropical cyclones.

Cyanide

Cyanides are chemicals that contain the "cyano-group". In that group a carbon atom has three bindings to a nitrogen atom. This group is present in many substances. Many of them are gases, but some are solids or liquids. Those substances that can release the compound CN are highly poisonous.

Certain bacteria, fungi and algae are able to produce cyanides. Cyanides are also found in certain foods or plants. In plants, the cyanides are usually bound to sugar molecules. The cyanides serve as a defense against being eaten by herbivores. 

In popular culture, cyanides are said to be highly toxic. As stated above, there are many cyanides that really are, but many others that are not. Prussian blue is given as a treatment to poisoning with Thallium and Caesium, for example.

The poisons referred to are usually hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and the chemicals which are similar to it, like potassium cyanide (KCN), and sodium cyanide (NaCN). (Such substances are called derivatives of hydrogen cyanide). Organic compounds that contain the CN group are called nitriles. Many of them are not as toxic as the ones cited before. Some of them are even used to produce drugs.

Some people think that glucose (sugars) may be an antidote against cyanide poisoning. They think that sugar can bind the free cyano group. That way the some of the poison could be neutralized.

<doc id="38419" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38419" title="2006 Atlantic hurricane season">
2006 Atlantic hurricane season

The 2006 Atlantic hurricane season was a annual event in the yearly cycle of tropical cyclones. It officially started on June 1, 2006, and lasted until November 30, 2006. Ten tropical storms formed during the season. Five became hurricanes, and one tropical storm did not have a name.

This season was unusual in that no hurricanes made landfall in the United States of America. One tropical storm, Tropical Storm Zeta from the 2005 season, continued into January, which was the second time on record that a tropical cyclone existed in two calendar years.

Because of the super-active 2005 season, forecasts and meteorologist thought that the 2006 season would also be very active, but not as active as 2005. However, an El Niño event, combined with the presence of the Saharan Air Layer over the tropical Atlantic Ocean, contributed to a slow season and forcing all tropical cyclones to dissipate after October 2.

On June 10, an area of thunderstorms became the year's first tropical depression. This storm moved closer to Florida, and the depression became a tropical storm on the morning of June 11. In the Gulf of Mexico, warm waters helped the storm to grow in strength, but it weakened slightly over the cooler waters near the coast of the United States.

Alberto crossed the coast about 50 miles southeast of Tallahassee, Florida on June 13. Parts of Cedar Key and Crystal River were flooded from the high sea waves associated with Alberto. Because Alberto was big in size, it took a long time to weaken over Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. Alberto moved to the northeast, as it changed from a tropical cyclone to an extratropical cyclone. As an extratropical storm, Alberto quickly became stronger while off the New England coast. Damage in the United States was about $565,000.
One tropical storm formed in July off the United States coast. It was not identified as a storm at the time, therefore, the storm did not have a name. It was identified as a tropical storm when a close review was taken at the end of 2006. If it was identified at the time it would have been named Beryl. 
In the middle of July, a series of low pressure areas formed off the United States. The southern-most low slowly moved to the south as it became more organized, a few hundred miles east of the North Carolina coast. On the morning of July 18, the low pressure area became the second tropical depression of the season, more than a month after Tropical Storm Alberto existed. That afternoon, the depression became Tropical Storm Beryl.

Beryl continued moving to the north until it turned to the northeast on July 20. Beryl moved parallel to the East Coast of the United States and crossed over Nantucket Island, before becoming extratropical southwest of Nova Scotia on July 21.
On about July 26, a large and well-organized tropical wave formed off the coast of Africa and slowly moved westward. It slowly developed due to poor environmental conditions and it became a tropical depression late on 31 July about east of Antigua. The depression soon strengthened further and was named Tropical Storm Chris six hours later. National Hurricane Center forecasters dismissed some computer models, which dissipated Chris quickly, as they did not have a handle on the strength of the storm. Tropical Storm Chris moved to the northwest and slowly strengthened before reaching its peak strength on August 2 with winds of , when it was to the northeast of the United States Virgin Islands. The storm was forecast to strengthen further and become a hurricane as it moved into the Bahamas and thus into the Gulf of Mexico. However, Chris began to be affected by strong wind shear and became disorganized. The storm weakened to a tropical depression on August 4, and dissipated as it approached the Cuban coast.

In response and some fear to the storm's projected path into the Gulf of Mexico, prices for crude oil rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange at branch offices in London. Natural gas prices rose considerably in New York Mercantile Exchange electronic trading on August 2. Anticipation of a threat to supply by a potential Hurricane Chris coupled with high demand during an ongoing heat wave are cited as reasons for the price move. Also, numerous oil rigs were closed and ditched in response to the storm for the fear of Hurricane Katrina a year earlier. On August 2 approximately 600 tourists evacuated the Puerto Rican islands of Vieques and Culebra as tropical storm warnings had been issued. Cruise lines such as Royal Caribbean re-routed their ships to avoid the storm. In Puerto Rico, rainfall from the storm caused the Fajardo River to overflow its banks. The overflown waters temporarily closed a highway in the northeastern portion of the island. Rainfall reached up to 2 inches (50 mm) across portions of Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and eastern Cuba, and reached 4 inches (100 mm) in some mountainous areas.
A tropical system off the coast of Africa, which the NHC was monitoring for several days, was upgraded to tropical depression status on August 21 and designated as Tropical Depression Four. Consequently, a tropical storm warning was immediately issued for the Cape Verde islands, as the system threatened to pass over or near the southern part of the archipelago. However, the system failed to strengthen into a tropical storm before passing the chain of islands, and the warning was discontinued the following morning.

The depression was upgraded to a tropical storm and was named Debby late on August 22. While it had been expected to strengthen into a hurricane, Debby weakened into a tropical depression on August 26. It continued to the north and lost tropical characteristics on August 27.

At 3:15 p.m. EDT (1915 UTC) on 24 August, a reconnaissance flight determined that a tropical wave passing through the Windward Islands had developed a closed tropical circulation, and advisories were commenced on Tropical Depression Five. By 5 p.m. EDT (2100 UTC) on 25 August, a second flight had found sustained tropical-storm force winds, and the system was named Ernesto. Ernesto became a hurricane on the morning of 27 August just south of Haiti, before it was downgraded back to a tropical storm in the afternoon. The storm caused 2 deaths in Haiti due to rainfall.

Ernesto made landfall near Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, early in the morning on 28 August. At one point the storm was predicted to become a major hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico and threaten parts of the Gulf Coast, a grim possibility in light of the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's landfall. However, Ernesto moved much farther east than anticipated, and made landfall as a tropical storm on the southern tip of Florida on 29 August. Two people died in Florida in road traffic accidents attributed to the weather conditions, as the cyclone slowly moved northward across the southern half of the peninsula. Ernesto restrengthened into a tropical storm as it emerged from land near Cape Canaveral, and was just below hurricane strength when it made landfall again in North Carolina on 31 August.

Damage in Virginia totaled to $104 million (2006 USD)
Tropical Depression Six formed from an area of low pressure midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles on 3 September. Initial strengthening of the depression was slow due to shearing wind conditions. Despite the moderate to high wind shear, it strengthened enough to become Tropical Storm Florence on the morning of 5 September. After becoming a tropical storm, Florence's wind field began to expand greatly; at one point tropical storm-force winds extended outward up to 405 miles from the center. With a disorganized structure and multiple circulation centers, Florence remained a weak tropical storm for several days, even after external conditions became favorable for strengthening. Around the evening of 8 September it resolved to a single center and steady strengthening resumed - "science had prevailed", as one forecaster remarked. On the morning of 10 September, Florence reached hurricane strength. Large swells, rip tide, and undertow were reported on Bermuda, the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Hispaniola. Florence soon reached its peak as a Category 1 hurricane very near Bermuda, and became extratropical on 12 September, while still a hurricane.

As Hurricane Florence moved norhtwestward, an area of low-pressure with scattered thunderstorm activity slowly became more organized while northeast of the Lesser Antilles. On the evening of September 10, it developed a closed circulation and was called Tropical Depression Seven. It continued to strengthen, and was then named Tropical Storm Gordon on September 11 and Hurricane Gordon late on September 12. Gordon attained Category 2 status on the evening of September 13, and was further upgraded to Category 3 status that same night, making it the first major hurricane of the season.

Around September 16 it was nearly froze for some time in the mid-Atlantic about 1000 miles east of Bermuda, and became a weak hurricane. However, it subsequently accelerated eastwards and strengthened to become category 2. On 19 September hurricane warnings were issued for the Azores, as the predicted path passed through the center of that archipelago. It became extratropical on September 20 after passing through Azorean waters, but the remnants side-swiped north-western Spain and then moved rapidly north towards Ireland and the west of Britain on September 21. By the morning of September 22, it had become absorbed into a large Atlantic low to the west of Ireland.
On September 10, an area of clustered thunderstorms began to move off the western African coast. It quickly became stronger and organized itself to become Tropical Depression Eight. Continuing to organize, it reached tropical storm strength on September 13, becoming a hurricane on September 16 and a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Sipson hurricane scale) on September 17. Helene moved generally west-northwestward before commencing a northeasterly turn. Large currents from Helene lashed Bermuda. The hurricane then became an extratropical storm on September 24 and died shortly after.
An area of low pressure in mid-Atlantic generated active thunderstorms for several days and eventually organized into Tropical Depression Nine on 27 September and a tropical storm by 28 September. By that time it was about east-southeast of Bermuda. It became a hurricane on 30 September, and passed about east of Bermuda before swinging northwards towards Newfoundland. As it was still a strong tropical storm near the Avalon Peninsula, tropical storm warnings were issued on 2 October due to the potential for high winds. Isaac passed to the southeast of Cape Race late that afternoon. The Canadian Hurricane Centre reports that if Isaac had tracked just 50 to 100 km (30 to 60 miles) further north than it did, the St. John's area would have experienced much higher winds than the peak gust of it received.

At its closest approach to the Avalon Peninsula, Isaac was still tropical, and had maximum sustained winds of and a minimum central pressure of 993 mbar. Strongest winds on land in Newfoundland were reported at Cape Race, where a maximum gust to with a sustained wind of was recorded. At Cape Pine, a peak wind was reported at . However, due to Isaac's small size and fast forward speed, winds were lighter over most of the Avalon Peninsula.

Rainfall from Isaac was not reported to be higher than in most areas due to Isaac's speed and decreasing amount of moisture. The highest measured amount was at Cape Race, while Cape Pine reported and St. John's reported less than .

The table on the right shows the ACE for each storm in the season. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 35 knots (39 mph/63 km/h) or tropical storm strength. 

The cumulative ACE for this season was toward the lower end of the official "Near Normal" grading. The number of tropical storms and hurricanes was near the long-term average.

These names will be used for storms that form in the North Atlantic in 2006. The names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2012 season. The list is the same as the 2000 season's list except for Kirk, which replaced Keith. 

While it had been previously reported that a new backup list would be chosen (after it was first used in 2005), the National Hurricane Center reported in its first tropical weather outlook for the season that it would again use names from the Greek alphabet should the main list run out. It would again start with Alpha.
No names were retired, and this was announced by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 2007. The names will be used again for 2012 Atlantic hurricane season.

Ceres (, ), also known as 1 Ceres, is the smallest dwarf planet in the Solar System and the only one in the main asteroid belt. It was discovered on January 1, 1801, by Giuseppe Piazzi, and is named after the Roman goddess Ceres—the goddess of growing plants, the harvest, and of motherly love. After about 200 years from its discovery, the International Astronomical Union decided to upgrade Ceres from an asteroid (or minor planet) to dwarf planetary status in 2006.

With a diameter of about 950 km, Ceres is by far the largest and most massive object in the asteroid belt, and has about a third of the belt's total mass. Recent observations have discovered that the asteroid is spherical, unlike the irregular shapes of smaller bodies with lower gravity. At its brightest it is still too dim to be seen with the naked eye.

On September 27, 2007, NASA launched the Dawn space probe to explore Ceres and Vesta.

An aquarium (plural "aquariums" or "aquaria") is a place where fish and other animals that live in water are kept by humans. An aquarium can be a small tank, or a large building with one or more large tanks.

Keeping an aquarium is a popular hobby around the world. Careful aquarists (people who keeps aquariums) make sure their fish live in an environment similar to their natural habitats. This means caring about water quality, lighting, and food.

Large, public aquariums are often popular tourist attractions. They show the fish and other animals they keep in large tanks, and also often protect species that are close to extinction. An example of a public aquarium is Sydney Aquarium, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

The coat of arms of Russia (Russian: ГербРоссии/Transkription Gerb rossi) was used since the year 1993 as coat of arms of Russia. Since the year 2000, the coat of arms was defined by court decision to the coat of arms of Russia. It is based on the coat of arms used before the Soviet Union. The coat of arms has been changed many time, but can be traced back for centuries. 

The double eagle was added Ivan III after his marriage with the Byzantine princess Sophia Paleologue. She was the niece of Constantine XI, the last Byzantine Emperor. The double-headed eagle was the symbol of the Byzantine Empire. The orb and scepter held by the eagle are heraldic symbols of sovereign power and autocracy.

The horse's rider is Saint George fightin a dragon. The three crowns were added in 1625. Through time, their meaning has changed. They have been seen as the conquered kingdoms of Kazan, Astrakhan and Siberia, or as the coming together of 'All the Russias' - "Grand Russia" (Russia), "Little Russia" (today's Ukraine) and "White Russia" (Belarus). In the modern time, they became the symbol for the three parts of government: Executive, legislative and Judiciary.

Brother Bear

Brother Bear is a 2003 Academy Award nominated traditionally-animated movie produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures on November 1, 2003. It is about a human named Kenai who turns into a bear and discovers brotherhood. The 43rd animated feature in the Disney animated features canon, it was originally titled "Bears", and was the third and final Disney animated movie produced mainly by the Feature Animation studio at Disney-MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida, that studio was shut down in March 2004, not long after the release of this movie in favor of computer animated features. The movie received an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Feature, but lost against Finding Nemo. A sequel, "Brother Bear 2", was released on August 29, 2006.

Long ago, as the Earth was emerging from the Ice Age, there were three brothers. After a bear takes the life of Sitka, the oldest brother, the impulsive youngest brother Kenai kills the bear in revenge, only to be changed into a bear himself by the Great Spirits. Denahi, the middle brother, comes upon this bear and, thinking it killed Kenai, vows revenge. Now, with brother hunting brother, Kenai's only hope to change back is to find the place where the lights touch the Earth. Along the way he meets a grizzly cub named Koda, who is also going there. So the adventure ensues and in the end, Kenai (with the help of Koda) discovers the true meaning of brotherhood.

The reaction from movie reviewers was mixed with many panning the movie as coping older Disney movies like "The Lion King" and the 20th Century Fox movie "Ice Age" (although "Brother Bear" began production before "Ice Age" did), while others defended the movie as a different and resonable variation of the theme. The popular American movie critics Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper have given positive reviews of the movie.


Score by Mark Mancina/Phil Collins


"Brother Bear 2" was released August 29, 2006.

It is unknown when there will be a television spin-off of "Brother Bear".

<doc id="38561" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38561" title="Logical volume management">
Logical volume management

Logical volume management is a method of allocating computer storage. It is about allocating space on "mass storage devices", like hard drives. It is more flexible than the partitioning of the drive into static (unchangeable) volumes. With a logical volume manager it is possible to grow partitions, even beyond the size of one physical disk. It is also possible to use striping or to put partitions together and combine them while they are being used. 

Logical volume management is a form of virtualisation. It makes it easier to adapt to the changing storage needs of computer users.

Volume managers differ but some basic concepts exist across most versions. The volume manager starts with "physical volumes" or PVs, which can be hard disk partitions, RAID devices or SAN LUNs. PVs are split into small chunks of even size (a default of 4 MB on HP-UX) called "physical extents" or PEs. The PEs are then pooled into a "volume group" or VG.

The pooled PEs can then be concatenated together into virtual disk partitions called "logical volumes" or LVs. These LVs behave just like hard disk partitions: mountable file systems can be created on them, or they can be used as raw block devices for swap.

The LVs can be grown by concatenating more PEs from the pool. Some volume managers allow LV shrinking; some allow online resizing in either direction. Changing the size of the LV does not necessarily change the size of a filesystem on it; it merely changes the size of its containing space. A file system that can be resized online is recommended because it allows the system to adjust its storage on-the-fly without interrupting applications.

PVs may also be organized into "physical volume groups" or PVGs. This allows LVs to be mirrored by pairing together its PEs with redundant ones on a different PVG, so that the failure of one PVG will still leave at least one complete copy of the LV online. In practice, PVGs are usually chosen so that their PVs reside on different sets of disks and/or data buses for maximum redundancy.

Some volume managers also implement snapshotting by applying copy-on-write (COW) to each PE. In this scheme, the volume manager will copy a PE to a "COW table" just before it is written to. This preserves an old version of the LE—the "snapshot"—which can later be reconstructed by overlaying the copy-on-write table on the current LE. Snapshots which are read-write are "branching snapshots" because they implicitly allow diverging versions of an LE.

Snapshots can be useful for backing up self-consistent versions of volatile data like table files from a busy database, or for rolling back large changes in one swoop, such as an operating system upgrade. Some Linux-based LiveCD systems also use snapshots to simulate read-write access on a read-only compact disc.

The levels of indirection that volume managers introduce can complicate disaster recovery, especially when the base operating system and other essential tools are themselves on an LE.

Many operating systems ship with LVMs:

The "Dragon Ball" series is separated into several other media adaptations, including two sequels, "Dragon Ball Z" and "Dragon Ball GT". Spinoffs include a trading card game, several movies, and multiple video games, making the Dragon Ball franchise well known world wide.

Saiyans are a race of aliens. They have great powers and technology. Most Saiyans travel from planet to planet destroying the people who live there so that they can sell the planet. Most Saiyans can be easily noticed by their tail but some have lost their tails. Saiyans without tails include Goku, Vegeta, and Gohan, Trunks, and Goten. The Saiyans lived on planet Vegeta which was later destroyed by Frieza.

A "Super Saiyan" is a transformation a Saiyan can go through. Only a few Saiyans have the potential to become Super Saiyans. The legend goes, once every 1,000 years a Super Saiyan emerges.

Only a few Saiyan characters have been able to become Super Saiyans:

Cell is not able to go Super Saiyan, even with the cells from Goku and Vegeta.

It is not known if females can become Super Saiyans.

He becomes intelligent, and learns to read and enjoy the world around him better. But later, people stop liking him as much because he makes them feel bad. He learns that it is more important to be a good person than a smart person. He frequents a class for feeble minded folks taught by a teacher named Miss Kinnian. While Charlie's IQ grows so does his love for her. He finds himself in a state of depression, unhappy and unsatisfied with his new artificial IQ.

The title of the book comes from a mouse in the story named Algernon who also has the experiment done on him.

Jam is a condiment. It is made from fruit usually, by adding sugar, and sometimes pectin. Most jams are cooked.

In the European Union, there is the jam directive (Council Directive 79/693/EEC, 24 July 1979). It sets minimum standards for the amount of "fruit" in jam, but the definition of fruit was expanded. This was done to take several unusual kinds of jam made in the EU into account. For this purpose, "fruit" is considered to include fruits that are not usually treated as fruits, such as tomatoes; fruits that are not normally made into jams, such as melons and watermelons; and vegetables that are sometimes made into jams, such as: rhubarb (the edible part of the stalks), carrots, sweet potatoes, cucumbers, and pumpkins. This definition continues to apply in the new directive, Council Directive 2001/113/EC (20 December 2001).

Vanilla is a flavoring. The plant it grows on is a vine. It grows by climbing other plants, like trees. It is derived from orchids in the genus Vanilla. The pure (man-made) form of the flavoring is known as vanillin. The main species harvested for vanilla is called "Vanilla planifolia". 

The plant was brought back to Europe by the Spanish. In Mesoamerica it was a well-regarded spice. 

Today, most of the flavoring is done in chemical laboratories.

Glatzer Neisse

The Glatzer Neiße (Polish Nysa Kłodzka) is a river that flows into the Oder river from the left.

It is 150 km long, and flows through the cities of the central forest (Miedzylesie): Habelschwerdt (Bystrzyca Kłodzka) and Glatz (Kłodzko). It then runs eastward. Other cities on the river are Patschkau (Paczków), Ottmachau (Otmuchów), Lausitzer Neiße (Lewin Brzeski) and Schurgast (Skorogoszcz). Finally, it flows at the village of Riebnig (Rybna) southeast from Brieg (Brzeg) into the Oder.

The Glatzer Neiße has often left its banks and flooded nearby cities, at times destroying them completely. City chronicles from Kłodzko mention floods in the following years:

Oder River

The Oder River (; Czech/) is a river in Central Europe. It starts in the Czech Republic and flows through Poland and Germany. It forms 187 kilometers of the border between Poland and Germany. The river is 854 kilometres long and ends in the Szczecin Lagoon in the Baltic Sea.

Some bigger towns the Oder passes are Wrocław, Eisenhüttenstadt, Frankfurt on the Oder, Szczecin and Police. The biggest city on the Oder River is Wrocław, in Lower Silesia, Poland.

The Oder River has different names in different languages. Most of these names are very similar, or almost the same:
These names come from the Latin language names. In Medieval Latin the river was called "Od(d)era". In Renaissance Latin, which was invented in 1534, the river was called "Viadrus".

In the Old Church Slavonic language, the name of the river was Vjodr.
The Oder is 854 km long. 112 km pass through the Czech Republic. 742 km pass through Poland. 187 km make up part of the border between Germany and Poland.

The Oder is the second-longest river in Poland. (The Vistula is the longest river.)

It begins in a watershed in the Oder Mountains that is 118,861 km². This basin is mostly in Poland, but a little bit is in the Czech Republic and Germany. The river runs through five voivodeships in Poland, and two states in Germany.

The river ends in the Szczecin Lagoon near Police, Poland. Here the Oder splits into three other rivers: the Dziwna River, the Świna River, and the Peene River. These three rivers start in Szczecin Lagoon and end Bay of Pomerania in the Baltic Sea.

The biggest city on the Oder River is Wrocław in Lower Silesia, Poland.

The Oder passes through 28 major cities and towns. These are:

After the river splits, the Dziwna River branch passes through 3 towns:

The Świna River branch passes through:

Robert Schumann

Robert Schumann (b. Zwickau in Saxony, June 8, 1810; died July 29, 1856) was a famous German composer. He lived in the time called the Romantic period. He had to give up his plans for being a concert pianist because he injured his hand. He published a music magazine and wrote a lot of articles about music that had just been composed. His music is full of things that are typical of Romantic music: it is full of emotion, the pieces often have titles that describe things, and they are often inspired by literature. He wrote a great deal of piano music. Some of this music is hard to play, but other pieces are quite easy. Many children learn to play some of the pieces in his "Album for the Young". His songs (Lieder) are among the best ever written. He also wrote larger works like symphonies and concertos and chamber music. Sometimes he felt very happy but at other times he was very depressed. These changes of mood can be heard in a lot of his music.

Robert Schumann was the fifth and youngest child of a bookseller and publisher. As a boy he liked reading the books in his father’s shop. He began to compose when he was seven. At school he was extremely good at music and literature. He passed his school-leaving examination with very high marks. His family wanted him to be a lawyer, so he went to Leipzig to study law but he hardly ever went to any lectures. He was much more interested in music and literature, but also in women and drinking. He took piano lessons from a teacher called Friedrich Wieck. Wieck had a 9 year-old daughter Clara. Many years later she was to become his wife. Clara was a brilliant pianist. Her father took her on concert tours because she was a prodigy.

Schumann started to compose short piano pieces and songs. He loved the music of Schubert and when he heard that Schubert had died he cried all night. He often practised the piano for seven hours a day. However, he started to have problems with his fingers. It has often been said that he hurt his hands because he made something to stretch his fingers, but people now think it was more likely due to mercury poisoning because doctors had used mercury to try to cure his syphilis. Whatever the reason, he could not continue to be a pianist and he spent the rest of his life composing and writing about music. Many of his articles appeared in a journal called "Neue Zeitschrift für Musik" ("New Journal for Music") which he started.

In 1834 he became engaged to a girl of sixteen called Ernestine, but then Schumann broke off the engagement because he loved Clara Wieck. Clara’s parents did not want her to marry him. Her father did everything he could to stop the marriage. Maybe he guessed that Schumann had syphilis, maybe he knew that he was often drunk. In the end, after many arguments, court cases and secret meetings between Robert and Clara, they were married in 1840.

Schumann suffered from manic depression. When he was depressed he hardly wrote anything, but 1840 was a happy year for him and he wrote lots of songs as well as orchestral music. In 1841 he wrote four symphonies. In 1842 they went on a concert tour together, but Schumann found it difficult because Clara was more famous than he was. He returned alone to Leipzig to work at his publishing. He felt depressed again at this time and drank a lot of beer and champagne. He was happy again when Clara returned, and composed some chamber music. In 1844 they toured Russia and played to the Tsar. By August he had a complete nervous breakdown and could not bear to listen to his own music. It took him some time to recover.

By now he was good at writing all kinds of music. He wrote music for the famous play "Faust" by Goethe. He wrote one opera, "Genoveva" , in 1849. His fame spread slowly. For many years Dresden and Leipzig were the only towns where he was famous. In 1850 he became musical director at Düsseldorf. In 1853 he met Brahms. Brahms became a great friend of the Schumann family. Schumann published an article in the "Neue Zeitschrift für Musik" with the heading “Neue Bahnen” (“New Paths”) in which he said that Brahms (who was 20 at the time) was going to be a very great composer. He was right.

Schumann had often thought of trying to kill himself. On 27 February 1854 he threw himself into the river Rhine. He was rescued by some boatmen, but when they brought him to land he seemed to have gone quite mad. He was taken to an asylum where he spent the last two years of his life. He died on 29 July 1856.

Schumann’s piano music is very well known. Although he had to give up his career as a pianist his wife Clara played his pieces and helped them to become famous. Many of his piano works are collections of short pieces, each with a title e.g. "Papillons" ("Butterflies"), "Davidsbündlertänze", "Carnaval". Schumann was thinking of carnival celebrations when he wrote these pieces. The Davidsbündler was a group of people Schumann belonged to who did not like the “Philistines” (people who did not enjoy good music, named after the Philistines in the Bible) In "Carnaval" the two sides of Schumann’s personality are represented by Florestan and Eusebius. Schumann's manic depression (the happy and the tragic moods that he had) are heard side by side in his music. Other piano works include "Scenes from Childhood", "Kreisleriana" and the popular "Album for the Young" which has some quite easy pieces like "Soldier’s March" and the famous "Träumerei" ("Dreaming"). There are also longer works for piano: 3 sonatas, a Toccata and a Phantasie.

His chamber music includes string quartets and a famous piano quintet. 

Schumann was one of the great composers of Lieder (German songs). He chose poetry by famous German poets and set them to music in very imaginative ways. The piano has very interesting accompaniments which help to bring out the meaning of the words. He wrote a song-cycle called "Dichterliebe" ("Poet’s Love") which is a setting of some poems by Heinrich Heine. Another song-cycle is called "Frauenliebe und -leben" ("Woman’s Love and Life") to words by Adalbert von Chamisso. 

Although the young Schumann seemed to prefer writing short pieces, he became more interested in long works after meeting Mendelssohn. He was also inspired to write symphonies after he discovered Schubert’s Symphony no 9 which no one knew that Schubert had written. He found it in a box in Vienna at the house of Schubert’s brother. Schumann wrote four symphonies. One of his best is the Third which is often called the "Rhenish" Symphony (after the river Rhine). The Fourth in d minor is also a great work. Using only a few musical ideas he develops them in many ways and writes a long, four-movement work. His piano concerto is a great favourite. Clara Schumann played it with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra at its first performance on New Year’s Day 1846.

After Schumann’s death Clara devoted herself to playing her husband’s music and helping it to become well known. She visited England regularly where she played at concerts. She also edited a lot of Schumann’s works for the publisher Breitkopf und Härtel.

A lecture is when someone talks to a group of people about something interesting. It is like a lesson. At college or university students go to lectures to learn things. The person who is teaching (talking to the group) is called the lecturer.

Sometimes we say that someone was "given a lecture". This means that he was told off for doing something wrong.

Clara Schumann

Clara Schumann (born Leipzig 13 September, 1819; died Frankfurt am Main 20 May, 1896), was the wife of composer Robert Schumann. She was a famous pianist and composer. 

Clara was born Clara Wieck. Her father taught her the piano. She was a prodigy and by the time she was thirteen her father was taking her on concert tours.

She was only nine years old when Robert Schumann came to Leipzig to study law at the university. Robert Schumann’s family had told him that he had to study law, but he wanted to be a musician. He took piano lessons from Clara’s father, Friedrich Wieck.

Clara not only learned the piano, she also studied singing, the violin, instrumentation, score reading, counterpoint and composition. By 1835 she was famous in the whole of Europe and was admired by Goethe, Mendelssohn, Chopin, Paganini and, of course, Robert Schumann.

Clara’s father did not want them to marry. He did everything he could to stop the marriage. For several years life was very difficult for them, but in the end, by 1840, they were married.they married by court permission
They had a happy marriage and had eight children. Clara played her husband’s piano works (Schumann had a hand injury and had to stop playing the piano). She ran the household and earned money by teaching and performing. Life was not always easy. When they went on tours together Clara was more famous than her husband, and this was difficult for him. Robert often had depression. They both taught at the Leipzig Conservatorium and Clara also taught privately in Dresden and Düsseldorf.

Robert Schumann died in 1856 after two years in a mental asylum. Clara was left with seven small children to bring up. Nevertheless she continued her career as a pianist and often travelled to other countries, especially England, where she played Robert’s piano works. She was great friends with Brahms and often performed his works, too.

Clara’s own compositions are all from her early years. She was a very gifted composer. In those days people thought that women should not be composers. Playing the piano was one thing, but a woman was not expected to be a professional composer. Clara knew this, and devoted more time to her playing, and to editing her husband’s music.

Clara’s compositions include more than 20 piano works, a piano concerto, some chamber music and several songs.

Composition

Composition means literally "putting together".

The word "composition" is used in literature, drama and poetry means the way that words are put together. 

Musical composition means putting notes together to make a piece of music.

The word "composition" is used in art to mean the way that colors or shapes are put together.

It is also used in mathematics and science in a number of ways, all meaning "putting things together".

Composition (music)

In music the word composition can be used in two ways.

A composition is a piece of music (the word "composition" means "putting together", so a composition is something where music notes have been put together). When a composer writes a piece of music he or she is making a musical composition.

The word "composition" can also mean learning the skill of how to compose. Music students may go to music college to study composition. They will do this by looking at famous pieces of music to see how the composers of the past wrote music. They will study musical form, harmony, orchestration, counterpoint and learn about all the instruments and how to write well for them so that it sounds nice.

<doc id="38700" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38700" title="Theory of relativity">
Theory of relativity

The theory of relativity was developed by Albert Einstein in the early 1900s. There are two theories of relativity. The first is special relativity and the second is general relativity. Both are based on the principle of relativity, which was created by Galileo Galilei in the 1600s.

Special relativity says that every person has their own time. One person's clock says something different from another person's clock. The reason a person's time can be different from another's is because of time dilation, which can be thought of more easily by the twin paradox. 

The twin paradox shows how time changes because of speed and mass. The faster someone or something moves or the more mass they have, then the slower time passes for them. This is shown by a pair of twins. Imagine that the first twin moves at a fast speed, near the speed of light for example, while the other twin stays in one general location. When the first twin returns from his trip, he will be younger than the second twin. Thus time and speed are related.


General relativity adds gravity to special relativity. It says that space and time are joined together. Space is like a grid. Balls (planets) on the grid bend it because of their mass or speed. As one ball moves towards another it falls towards the other ball due to the dent in the grid. It can be shown by putting heavy balls on a trampoline. The dent in the grid is like gravity shown by the planets.

If space and time are one thing represented by a grid and heavy objects stretch out the grid, that means that time passes more slowly near heavy objects. This has been shown in experiments by comparing very accurate clocks on Earth (where Earth's gravity is strong) with very accurate clocks on satellites or rockets in space (where Earth's gravity is weak).

G. O. Mueller wrote a whole encyclopedia arguing against Einstein's relativity. Mueller, and many other philosophers say that space and time are categories of perception, not distortable "things," and so ideas of relativity that treat them as "things" cannot be correct.
Paul Dirac and others have said that constants may change over time, including the speed of light. Mueller lists about 4000 Einstein-critical works since 1905, suggesting rethinking relativity.

BIOS

BIOS, in computing, stands for Basic Input/Output System. The BIOS is a computer program embedded on a chip on a computer's motherboard that recognizes and controls various devices that make up the computer. The purpose of the BIOS is to make sure all the things plugged into the computer can work properly.

"Booting up" is the process that a computer completes to get it ready to use when it is first turned on. When the computer turns on, the BIOS starts up and performs a Power-On Self Test (POST). During the POST, the BIOS will check various devices in the computer like the computer processor, memory, the video card and others to make sure they are present and functioning. Once the POST has completed successfully, the BIOS looks for an operating system to load, which is usually located on the computer's hard drive. When it finds one, it starts to load it. At this point, the operating system takes over control of the system. 

Some people try to configure their computer to run faster than it was designed to do. This is called "overclocking". Since the BIOS controls the computer processor, entering the BIOS setup screen while it is booting up gives people access to advanced computer settings. For most computers, pressing the delete or F12 buttons while the computer is booting up will bring up the BIOS setup screen. There are many ways a computer can be overclocked to run faster, but most involve simply turning up the speed of the computer processor. Doing this will usually make your computer run much hotter, though, and can sometimes break your computer, which is why overclocking will usually void your computer's warranty. Only people who are computer hardware experts should attempt to overclock their computers.

Anna Politkovskaya wrote for the newspaper "Novaya Gazeta". She was born in the New York City, United States. Her parents were diplomants. Her birth name was Anna Stepanovna Mazepa (Russian:"Анна Степановна Мазепа"). 

She was best known for her thoughts about the war in Chechnya, a Russian state. She was also against the current leader of Russia, president Vladimir Putin. Many of her texts asked for human rights.

On 7 October 2006, she was murdered at her house in Moscow. Many people she was murdered for political reasons. Many Western regimes have pressed for a thorough investigation of the circumstances of her death. They see it as another attempt to stifle opposition to the current Russian regime, as perhaps one of the last chances to save the freedom of the press in Russia. The "Noyava Gazeta" has put up a reward for information that can explain why she was killed.

Woodworking

Woodworking is a skill. In woodworking, one can cut or sand (make wood smooth).

When one is doing woodworking, be careful of any potential harm. Remember to wear safety goggles or a facemask (like safety goggles. but to protect ones face). Do not wear long clothing, because it can get stuck in a tool.

There are a lot of woodworking classes, and lots of them are offered in middle schools. 

In woodworking, the type of wood you get is very important. There are two types of wood: soft and hard wood. The words hard and soft wood comes from the type of tree it came from. So a hard pice of wood could be a soft wood.

There are a lot of tools that people use a lot during woodworking, such as sandpaper (used to make wood nice to touch), files, rasps (all used for trimming wood, cutting, etc), saws (cutting wood), and automatic saws (saws that use electricity to run).

Anaesthesia (or Anesthesia) is when a doctor can block pain, make you sleep, and keep you safe. That way, people can have surgery without feeling most of that pain. It makes surgery much safer and more comfortable.

More precisely, anaesthesia (or anesthesia) is 'sleep' and analgesia is the relief of pain. Modern anaesthesia is highly complex and often involves a combination of anaesthesia, analgesia and muscle relaxation to enable surgeons or proceduralists to do their part. These three tasks are known as the triad of anaesthesia.

If people are simply made to feel more pleasant, or less anxious, this is called sedation.

Printing

Printing is putting words and images on paper, most of the time using ink. Books and newspapers are made by printing.

Printing is one of the technologies which has changed the world. It is an efficient way to multiply writing, so that copies may be made available to all people. Printing is therefore the continuation of writing by mechanical means.

Writing originated after people had settled in permanent dwellings. It dates from 3,300, which is over 5000 years ago. A variety of writing systems were invented, long before paper was invented. Clay, papyrus, wood, slate and parchment (prepared animal skins) have all been used. The invention of paper by the Chinese was a step forward.

The earlist printing known was in 8th century China and Korea. Whole pages carved on flat wooden blocks were used. Covered with a carbon-based ink, they were pressed onto sheets of paper.

The second stage was to use separate characters by carving or casting. This was done in 11th century China and Korea. It failed to be really successful, because of the structure of the Chinese written language, shared at the time by Korea, which had thousands of characters. Because of this, the method was not significantly better that copying by scribes.

Printing was reinvented in 15th century Europe. Though slow to develop at first, print became the main means of communication between people who wished to record knowledge. It was hugely successful, largely because, with an alphabetic system of writing, print was much more economical than copying, and permitted many times as many copies to be available for readers. It was a revolution which helped all aspects of life in Europe, at a time when Europe was becoming the dominant region of the world.

Along with a technology for printing words, there were various means for printing graphics. Carving on blocks of wood, engraving on copper were used up until about 1800. After that, a bewildering array of inventions arrived, including ways to print photographs.

Machines to speed printing, cheaper paper, automatic stitching and binding all arrived in the 19th century during the industrial revolution. What had once been done by a few men by hand was now done by limited companies on huge machines. The result was much lower prices, and a much wider readership.

The Dark Side of the Moon

The Dark Side Of The Moon is a famous album by the band Pink Floyd. The album sold over 45 million copies.

It was released in 1973 and is their ninth album. It is one of the most famous albums of all time, frequently placing in the top five whenever a rock music authority makes a list of the greatest albums of all time.

Its cover, which features a ray of white light going through a prism, is also one of the most famous album covers of all time. Analysts say that statistically, Dark Side Of The Moon is always playing somewhere on planet Earth. It is one of the most famous concept albums (Albums where all the songs are about a central theme. Some concept albums tell a specific story), and used to be the best-selling album of all time. There is an album-pressing plant in Germany that does nothing but create copies of Dark Side Of The Moon.

Dark Side of the Moon is about life, death and madness. 

The first song, ""Speak to Me"", features ticking clocks, a racing heartbeat, people talking, and it ends in a loud scream. 

""Breathe"" is a slow moving song about how endless life feels sometimes.

""On the Run"" is the next song. Footsteps, airplanes, and an explosion are all heard. The song gives the listener the feeling of being chased.

""Time"", one of the album's most famous songs, is about how rushed humans can feel sometimes. An idea expressed is that people give themselves so much to do, yet so little time to do it.

""The Great Gig In The Sky"" is a song featuring vocals by Clare Torry. It was originally called ""The Mortality Sequence"", and featured sounds from religious radio. 

""Money"", the album's best-selling single, is a catchy jazz song about currency.

""Us & Them"" is an anti-war song, backing up the idea from ""Time"" that life is too short to be wasted on something like war. 

""Any Colour You Like"" is an instrumental song.

""Brain Damage"" is one of the most haunting songs on the album, seemingly spoken by a mentally ill person. 

""Eclipse"", the final song on Dark Side Of The Moon is about life in general, and repeats all the themes from the album.

The album spent over 14 years on the Billboard charts and it is currently the ninth best selling album in the United States.

Some say that when synchronized with the movie "The Wizard of Oz", there are many similarities between the two.

"The Dark Side of the Moon" became one of the best-selling albums of all time. It is in the top 25 of a list of best selling albums in the United States. It held the number one spot in the US for only a week. But, it remained in the "Billboard" album chart for a total of 778 weeks (nearly 14 years). This is the longest any album has spent on the "Billboard" charts. The album came back on the "Billboard" charts when the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart was introduced in May 1991. It has stayed there since then. In the UK it is the sixth-best-selling album of all time.

The alto flute is not very often used, and only in very large orchestras. Maurice Ravel wrote a beautiful tune for alto flute in "Daphnis et Chloé". Igor Stravinsky used one in "The Rite of Spring". In "The Planets" by Gustav Holst there is a passage with three flutes and alto flute playing 4 part harmony.

The alto flute must not be confused with a bass flute which is even bigger and lower and very unusual indeed.

Stevenage

Stevenage is a town in Hertfordshire in England. It is between the towns of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City.

In 1801, 1,430 people lived in Stevenage. In 1901, 4,049 people lived in Stevenage. In 2001, 79,724 lived in Stevenage. The town grew the most in the 1950s and 1960s, when it became the first new town in the world.

The name Stevenage may come from an Old English word meaning "place at the stiff oak". 

Stevenage started as a village and people have lived there since Roman times. Some Roman remains were found when the New Town was being built. There are also six Roman round barrows, which is where a local family was buried.

In 1281, Stevenage was allowed to have a market twice a week and a fair every year. The fair still takes place every year.

Stevenage became the first New Town on 1 August 1946, and was planned with six neighbourhoods.

The town centre was the first shopping area in Britain with no traffic. It was opened in 1959 by Queen Elizabeth II. In the town centre there is a clock tower, fountain and a statue called "Joyride", which is a statue of a mother and child. It was made by Franta Belsky. In 1999, a millennium countdown clock was put up on the town centre clock tower, which showed how much time was left until the year 2000. In 2005, plans were made for the town centre to be made more modern. The changes could take 10 years.

Next to the town centre is the town gardens, a modern church and a museum.

Stevenage has lots of roundabouts and not many traffic lights. There are also lots of cycle tracks for people to ride on. Stevenage has some of the tallest street lights in the country. The town is a very green town, with lots of trees and grass. Fairlands Valley is a large park in the middle of Stevenage. There are also many playing fields. The schools in Stevenage all have large fields.

Many schools were built in the 1950s and 1960s because a lots of people from London were moving to Stevenage. The town has around 23 primary schools and several secondary schools.

Stevenage has a leisure centre and a theatre in the town centre. There is a leisure park with a large cinema, and lots of clubs and restaurants. Stevenage also has two industrial areas.

Stevenage Borough F.C. is the town's football team, which plays in League One and is based at Broadhall Way.

Stevenage holds a number of events every year including Stevenage Day, Rock in the Park and Stevenage Carnival. The Carnival ended in 2003 but it is returning 6th June 2010. [www.stevenagecarnivalday.org]

Stevenage has lots of places of worship for people of several different religions. Many of the Christian churches work together for town-wide projects under the name of CTIS "Churches Together in Stevenage".

Stevenage is twinned with the following places around the world:
Stevenage has been twinned with Shimkent since 1990
Stevenage has been twinned with Kadoma since 1989 and recently celebrated its 20th anniversary. [www.skla.org.uk]
Stevenage has been twinned with Ingelheim since 1963 [www.tsiaa.org.uk]
Stevenage has been twinned with Autun since 1975. It was incorporated into the Stevenage-Ingelheim Association as Ingelheim and Autun were already twinned. see Stevenage-Ingelheim-Autun Association [www.tsiaa.org.uk]

Yu-Gi-Oh! is a manga series, two anime series, and two editions trading card game editions based on the two anime series.

The series follows the adventures of Yugi Mutou, a high schooler who plays a game called Duel Monsters. It has a spin-off called Yu-Gi-Oh! GX. Japan has an exclusive anime based on the first seven volumes of the manga.

"Yu-Gi-Oh cards" are a trading card game that uses monsters that Yugi and other characters on the show use. This trading card game is very popular with young children and also teenagers even adults in HongKong and Taiwan.

"Yu-Gi-Oh!" is not only about Duel Monsters. Yugi's grandfather Sugoroku Mutou (Solomon Muto) owns a game shop. One day, Yugi finds a strange puzzle at the back of the shop, and tries to solve it. He tries to solve the puzzle for 8 years. When he is 16, he solves it. When he finishes the puzzle, he gets an extra soul. This soul is Dark Yugi (Yami Yugi), an Egyptian Pharaoh. Yami Yugi has lost his memory. Together, they must get it back. After that, Yugi must save the world from Dark Bakura (Yami Bakura), who is Dark Yugi's worst enemy.

Travelling Salesman Problem

The Travelling Salesman Problem (often called TSP) is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science. It is focused on optimisation. In this context "better solution" often means "a solution that is cheaper". TSP is a mathematical problem. It is most easily expressed as a graph describing the locations of a set of nodes.

The Travelling Salesman Problem describes a salesman who must travel between N cities. The order in which he does so is unimportant, provided he visits each one during his trip, and finishes in his starting location. Each city is connected to other close by cities, or nodes, by airplanes, or by road or railway. Each of those links between the cities has one or more weights (cost) attached. The cost describes how "difficult" it is to traverse this edge on the graph, and may be given, for example, by the cost of an airplane ticket or train ticket, or perhaps by the length of the edge, or time required to complete the traversal. The salesman wants to keep both the travel costs, as well as the distance he travels as low as possible. 

The Traveling Salesman Problem is typical of a large class of "hard" optimization problems that have intrigued mathematicians and computer scientists for years. Most important, it has applications in science and engineering. For example, in the manufacture of a circuit board, it is important to determine the best order in which a laser will drill thousands of holes. An efficient solution to this problem reduces production costs for the manufacturer. 
The travelling salesman problem is regarded as difficult to solve. If there is a way to break this problem into smaller component problems, the components will be at least as complex as the original one. This is what computer scientists call NP-hard problems.

Many people have studied this problem. The easiest (and most expensive solution) is to simply try all possibilities. The problem with this is that for N cities you have (N-1) factorial possibilities. This means that for only 10 cities there are over 3.6 million combinations to try (9*8*7...etc).

Anno Domini

Anno Domini (Latin : "In the year of (our) Lord"), shortened as AD or A.D., is used to refer to the years after the birth of Jesus. AD is also a shortening for Christian Era. Similarly, Before Christ, shortened as BC or B.C., is used in the English language to refer to all years before the start of the time period "Anno Domini". 

The system for working out the years was invented by Dionysius Exiguus in about AD 525. He fixed the point Anno Domini, which is used to number the years of both the Gregorian calendar and the Julian calendar. He used it to identify the several Easters in his Easter table. He did not use it to date any historical event. When he devised his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year — he himself stated that the "present year" was "the consulship of Probus Junior [Flavius Probus]", which he also stated was 525 years "since the incarnation [conception] of our Lord Jesus Christ". How he arrived at that number is unknown. He invented a new system of numbering years to replace the Diocletian years that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The Anno Domini era became dominant in Western Europe only after it was used by the Venerable Bede to date the events in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, completed in 731.

John Gorton

Sir John Grey Gorton (9 September 1911 – 19 May 2002) was the 19th Prime Minister of Australia. He was elected Liberal Party leader after Harold Holt was drowned. He was a fighter pilot during the Second World War and had a battle scarred face. He said he was "Australian to the bootheels".

Bettina Brown married Gorton in 1935. She died in 1983. Then, in 1993, Gorton married Nancy Home. 

As Prime Minister he said he wanted to help Australian movies and the arts. His government set up the Australian Council for the Arts, the Australian Film Development Corporation and the National Film and Television Training School. His government made men and women get equal pay for equal work. His government increased pensions and allowances and education scholarships and provided free health care to 250,000 poor people (but not universal health care).

Gorton's government kept Australia in the Vietnam War but stopped replacing troops at the end of 1970 - the beginning of the end of Australia being in the war. He had good relations with U.S. President Richard Nixon and with Britain's Prime Ministers, but this was a time when Australia was starting to move closer to Asia. 

Gorton was popular with lots of ordinary people, but not a good manager of other people in his party. State Liberal leaders did not like that he was moving more power to Canberra (the national capital) and some other Liberals did not like his policies or personal behaviour. The Liberals lost votes in the 1969 election and the half-senate election in 1970. In 1971, the Defence Minister, Malcolm Fraser, resigned and said Gorton was "not fit to hold the great office of Prime Minister". The Liberal party split 50/50 over a vote to replace him and he decided not to vote for himself and resigned as their leader. So he also stopped being Prime Minister. Gorton never forgave Malcolm Fraser.

William McMahon became Prime Minister and Gorton became Defence Minister from March to August, 1971. But Gorton wrote articles for the newspapers about his time in office - headed: "I did it my way" - and McMahon got him to resign. After Gough Whitlam's Labor Party won in 1972, Liberal leader Billy Snedden made Gorton the Opposition Spokesman for the Environment. Gorton then supported abortion and got Parliament to say that homosexuality should be legal. 

When Malcolm Fraser became leader of the Liberal Party, Gorton walked out of the party room. A month later he resigned from the party. Then he tried to get elected an indepedent to the Senate in 1975. Gorton was unhappy with the way the Governor General sacked Gough Whitlam and the way Malcolm Fraser became Prime Minister, so he said people should vote Labor in 1975. He then retired from politics but worked in radio and supported things like drug law changes. With Fraser gone, John Howard's Liberal Party got Gorton back in the party and had a special gala dinner in Canberra in 1999. In 2001, a big party was held for his 90th birthday. It was organised by some of his old Liberal and National Party friends, but there were also messages from the Queen, U.S. and British leaders and all the Labor Prime Ministers of Australia.

He died in Sydney in 2002.

Sir William McMahon (23 February 1908 – 31 March 1988) was the 20th Prime Minister of Australia. He was elected to the Australian parliament in 1949, and stayed as Member for Lowe, in Sydney, for 33 years. He challenged John Gorton for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Australia in 1971 and won. He was 63 years old. He lost the next election in December 1972 to Gough Whitlam of the Australian Labor Party. This made him the first Prime Minister not to win an election since Labor's Ben Chifley (who lost in 1949). McMahon was married to (Lady) Sonia McMahon from 1965 until his death from cancer. Actor Julian McMahon is their son.

The Liberal party had won lots of elections since 1949, but had some popularity problems by 1971. Australian soldiers were still in the Vietnam War. McMahon replaced John Gorton, then made him defence minister, but soon after made him resign for talking about problems in the Liberal Party. McMahon's government was the first to have a Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Aboriginal land rights were an important topic of debate at this time. On foreign affairs, McMahon said the Opposition leader, Gough Whitlam, was wrong to visit communist China in 1972 - but soon after U.S. President Richard Nixon visited China and McMahon was embarrassed. The economy was not looking too good when the government went to the 1972 election.

Extrasolar planet

An extrasolar planet (also known as exoplanet) is a natural planet that exists outside of our solar system. As of 22 June 2011, astronomers have discovered 563 of them using various methods.

Data from the Kepler mission suggests there are at least 50 billion planets in our own galaxy. There also exist planets that orbit brown dwarfs and free floating planets that orbit the galaxy directly just as the stars do. It is unclear if either type should be called a "planet".

In the sixteenth century the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno, an early supporter of the Copernican theory that the Earth and other planets orbit the Sun, put forward the view that the fixed stars are similar to the Sun and are likewise accompanied by planets. Bruno was burnt at the stake by the Holy Inquisition. 

In the eighteenth century the same possibility was mentioned by Isaac Newton in his "Principia". Making a comparison to the Sun's planets, he wrote "And if the fixed stars are the centers of similar systems, they will all be constructed according to a similar design and subject to the dominion of "One"". 

The first published and confirmed discovery was made in 1988. It was finally confirmed in 1992.

In early 1992, radio astronomers announced the discovery of planets around another pulsar. These pulsar planets are believed to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the pulsar, in a second round of planet formation, or else to be the remaining rocky cores of gas giants that survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits.

On October 6, 1995, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva announced the first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star (51 Pegasi). This discovery, made at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, ushered in the modern era of exoplanetary discovery. Technological advances, most notably in high-resolution spectroscopy, led to the detection of many new exoplanets at a rapid rate. These advances allowed astronomers to detect exoplanets indirectly by measuring their gravitational influence on the motion of their parent stars. Additional extrasolar planets were eventually detected by observing the variation in a star's apparent luminosity as an orbiting planet passed in front of it.

Extrasolar planets can have many different forms compared to our solar system.

Extratropical cyclone

An extratropical cyclone (also known as "cyclones", "European windstorms", "nor'easters", and "mid-latitude cyclones") is a type of cyclone. It is a large low-pressure weather area with rain and wind and clouds, that is not similar to tropical cyclones or low-pressure weather areas from cold polar places. They are really many masses of cold and warm fronts producing rain, heavy wind, and sometimes tornadoes and even hail. Some Extratropical cyclones are made from tropical cyclones that become weak but do not die when they move over cold water. Sometimes, these weather areas can become even stronger than before as they turn into Extratropical cyclones. When made from tropical cyclones, they can still have an eye (a place in the middle of a tropical cyclone that is not as windy, cloudy, or rainy). European windstorms are sometimes made when wind from the northwestern part of the Atlantic carry them more east and north towards Europe. Nor'easters often hit northeastern North America, and are made when it is cold, most often in late fall. Wind from the west part of the Atlantic moves them north. They become stronger, and drop snow on the areas it moves into. When a nor'easter drops in pressure and become stronger, by more than one millibar every hour, it is called a weather bomb. Hurricane Hazel was extratropical but still hurricane-level when it hit Toronto, for example.

Frankenstein is an 1818 novel by the English writer Mary Shelley. The novel is about a young man who makes a monster by bringing a dead body back to life. The man's name is Victor Frankenstein.

Many people call the monster Frankenstein as well. "Frankenstein the scientist created Frankenstein the monster."

Frankenstein was a scientist who tried to make life. He stitched together parts from dead bodies(such as criminals executed at the gallows) and resurrected it back to life. The person was a monster. The monster scared Frankenstein. Frankenstein ran away. The monster was sad and angry. He saw a family. The monster learned to talk. The family made him leave. The monster killed Frankenstein's brother. The monster blamed Justine. Justine was killed. The monster talked to Frankenstein. He wanted Frankenstein to make a woman. The monster wanted to live with the woman. Frankenstein started to make the woman. He stopped. Frankenstein did not make the woman. The monster was angry. The monster killed Frankenstein's friend, Henry Clerval, and also Frankenstein's wife. Frankenstein chased the monster to the Arctic. Frankenstein met Captain Walton. Frankenstein went onto Captain Walton's ship. Frankenstein and Captain Walton talked. Frankenstein died. The monster saw Frankenstein. The monster wanted to kill himself because he felt lonely. So he did.

Mary Shelley was married to a poet named Percy Shelley. She was 16 when she thought of the story of "Frankenstein" but she actually wrote the story when she was 18. The book was published when she was 19 but her name was not put on the first edition in London. Her name only appeared on the second edition which was made in London.

Advance Australia Fair is the official national anthem of Australia. 

Peter Dodds McCormick (c. 1834 -1916) wrote the music and the words for the song. It was first performed in 1878, but it only became Australia's official anthem in 1984. 

Between 1878 and 1984, the song was used inside of Australia as a patriotic song. For a time the song announced the news from the Australian Broadcasting Commission. When Australia became a Federation in 1901, the song was sung by a choir of 10,000 people.

In 1977 there was a vote for the national anthem between four songs. The other three songs were:
"Advance Australia Fair" received 43.29% of the vote, defeating the three alternatives: "Waltzing Matilda" (28.28%), "Song of Australia" (9.65%), and the existing national anthem "God Save the Queen" (18.78%). However, it was not until 1984 that the national anthem was changed to reflect the popular vote.

Other songs and marches have been influenced by Advance Australia Fair, such as the Australian Vice-Regal salute.

Dracula traps Harker in his castle, and travels to England. He then preys on the young woman Lucy Westenra, and turns her into a vampire. Then he bites Jonathan's wife Mina. Because of this, the other characters, led by Professor Abraham van Helsing, go on a mission to find and kill Dracula.

Annular hurricane

An annular hurricane is a term used in the north Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean east of the International Dateline. An annular hurricane is a rare type of hurricane that has a big, circular eyewall, and thick, deep convection around it with no spiral rainbands. This structure allows the hurricane to maintain it's strength for longer durations, and in worse conditions than typical hurricanes.

2004 Summer Olympics

The 2004 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXVIII Olympiad, were celebrated in Athens, Greece from August 13, 2004, until August 29, 2004.

The four other candidate cities were Rome, Cape Town, Stockholm, and Buenos Aires. Six other cities had applied, but were turned down by the IOC in 1996. These cities were Istanbul, Lille, Rio de Janeiro, San Juan, Seville, and Saint Petersburg.

Athens won every round of voting and easily beat Rome in round 5, the final vote. Round 2 was to settle a tie break between Cape Town and Buenos Aires from round 1.

The ranking in this table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee.

The total number of bronze medals is greater than the total of gold or silver because in boxing and judo, two bronze medals were awarded in each weight class.

Countries are ranked firstly by the number of gold medals they have, then by the number of silver, and then by the number of bronze. Where countries have the same number of each type of medal, they are listed alphabetically and given the same ranking.

Medal numbers shown in bold are the highest in their section. Greece, the host nation is highlighted in lavender.

1896 Summer Olympics

The 1896 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the I Olympiad, were celebrated in Athens, Greece from April 6, through April 15, 1896. It was the first international Olympic Games held in the Modern era. Because Ancient Greece was the birthplace of the Olympic Games, Athens was an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) was also instituted during this congress.

The 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success even though there were many obstacles and setbacks. The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date. The Panathinaiko Stadium, the only Olympic stadium used in the 19th Century, overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event. The highlight for the Greeks was the marathon victory by Spyridon Louis. The most successful competitor was German wrestler and gymnast Carl Schuhmann, who won four events.

After the Games, Rhys Coubertin and the IOC were petitioned by several prominent figures including Greece's King George and some of the American competitors in Athens, to hold all the following Games in Athens. But the 1900 Summer Olympics were already planned for Paris and, except for the Intercalated Games of 1906, the Olympics did not return to Greece until the 2004 Summer Olympics, some 108 years later.

The stories about the events and people of these Games were in the 1984 NBC miniseries, "The First Olympics: Athens, 1896" – starring David Ogden Stiers as William Milligan Sloane and Louis Jourdan as Pierre de Coubertin.

In the 18th century, several small-scale sports festivals in Europe were named after the Ancient Olympic Games. The 1870 Olympics at the Panathenaic stadium had 30,000 people. Coubertin took Dr William Penny Brooke's idea to have a multi-national and multi-sport event—the ancient games were in a sense international, because various Greek city-states and colonies were represented, but only free male athletes of Greek origin were allowed to participate. In 1890, Coubertin wrote an article in "La Revue Athletique", which talked about the importance of Much Wenlock—a rural market town in the English county of Shropshire. It was here that, in October 1850, the local physician William Penny Brookes started the Wenlock Olympian Games, a festival of sports and recreations that included athletics and team sports, such as cricket, football and quoits. Coubertin also took inspiration from the earlier Greek games organized under the name of Olympics by businessman and philanthropist Evangelis Zappas in 1859, 1870 and 1875. The 1896 Athens Games was funded by the legacies of Evangelis Zappas and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas and by George Averoff who had been specifically requested by the Greek government, through crown prince Constantine, to sponsor the second refurbishment of the Panathinaiko Stadium. The Greek government did fix the stadium even though the cost of refurbishing the stadium in marble had already been funded in full by Evangelis Zappas forty years earlier.

On June 18, 1894, Coubertin put together a group at the Sorbonne, in Paris, to present his plans to representatives of sports societies from 11 countries. After his proposal's acceptance by the congress, a date for the first modern Olympic Games needed to be chosen. Coubertin suggested that the Games be held at the same time as the 1900 Universal Exposition of Paris. Concerned that a six-year wait might lessen public interest, congress members instead chose 1896. With a date established, members of the congress turned to the choice of a host city. Since Greece was the original home of the Olympics, all the congress approved the decision of Athens. Vikelas was then elected the first president of the newly established International Olympic Committee (IOC).

On April 6 (March 25 according to the Julian calendar then in use in Greece), the games of the First Olympiad were officially opened; it was Easter Monday for both the Western and Eastern Christian Churches and the anniversary of Greece's independence. The Panathinaiko Stadium was filled with an estimated 80,000 spectators, including King George I of Greece, his wife Olga, and their sons. Most of the competing athletes were aligned on the infield, grouped by nation. After a speech by the president of the organizing committee, Crown Prince Constantine, his father officially opened the Games:

"I declare the opening of the first international Olympic Games in Athens. Long live the Nation. Long live the Greek people."

Afterwards, nine bands and 150 choir singers performed an Olympic Hymn, composed by Spyridon Samaras, with words by poet Kostis Palamas. Thereafter, a variety of musical offerings provided the backgrounds to the Opening Ceremonies until 1960, since which time the Samaras/Palamas composition has become the official Olympic Anthem (decision taken by the IOC Session in 1958). Other elements of current Olympic opening ceremonies were started later: the Olympic flame was first lit in 1928, the first athletes' oath was sworn at the 1920 Summer Olympics, and the first officials' oath was taken at the 1972 Olympic Games.

At the 1894 Sorbonne congress, a large roster of sports were suggested for the program in Athens. The first official announcements regarding the sporting events to be held featured sports such as football and cricket, but these plans were never finalized, and these sports did not make the final list for the Games. Rowing and yachting were scheduled, but had to be canceled due to poor weather on the planned day of competition.

The athletics events had the most international field of any of the sports. The major highlight was the marathon, held for the first time in international competition. Spyridon Louis won the event and was the only Greek athletics champion and a national hero. Although Greece had been favored to win the discus and the shot put, the best Greek athletes finished just behind the American Robert Garrett in both events.

No world records were set, as few top international competitors had elected to compete. In addition, the curves of the track were very tight, making fast times in the running events hard. Despite this, Thomas Burke, of the United States, won the 100 meter race in 12.0 seconds and the 400 meter race in 54.2 seconds. Burke was the only one who used the "crouch start" (putting his knee on soil), confusing the jury. Eventually, he was allowed to start from his "uncomfortable position".

The rules of the International Cycling Association were used for the cycling competitions. The track cycling events were held at the newly built Neo Phaliron Velodrome. Only one road event was held, a race from Athens to Marathon and back (87 kilometers).

In the track events, the best cyclist was Frenchman Paul Masson, who won the one lap time trial, the sprint event, and the 10,000 meters. In the 100 kilometers event, Masson entered as a pacemaker for his compatriot Léon Flameng. Flameng won the event, after a fall, and after stopping to wait for his Greek opponent Georgios Kolettis to fix a mechanical problem. The Austrian fencer Adolf Schmal won the 12-hour race, which was completed by only two cyclists, while the road race event was won by Aristidis Konstantinidis.

The fencing events were held in the Zappeion, which, built with money Evangelis Zappas had given to revive the ancient Olympic Games, was not used before. Unlike other sports (in which only amateurs were allowed to take part at the Olympics), professionals were allowed to compete in fencing, though in a separate event. These professionals were considered gentlemen athletes, just as the amateurs.

Four events were scheduled, but the épée event was cancelled for unknown reasons. The foil event was won by a Frenchman, Eugène-Henri Gravelotte, who beat his countryman, Henri Callot, in the final. The other two events, the sabre and the masters foil, were won by Greek fencers. Leonidas Pyrgos, who won the latter event, became the first Greek Olympic champion in the modern era.

Gymnastics was at the infield of the Panathinaiko Stadium. Germany sent an 11-man team, which won five of the eight events, including both team events. In the team event on the horizontal bar, the German team was unopposed. Three Germans added individual titles: Hermann Weingärtner won the horizontal bar, Alfred Flatow won the parallel bars; and Carl Schuhmann, who also competed successfully in wrestling, won the vault. Louis Zutter, a Swiss gymnast, won the pommel horse, while Greeks Ioannis Mitropoulos and Nikolaos Andriakopoulos were victorious in the rings and rope climbing events, respectively.

Held at a range at Kallithea, the shooting competition was five events—two using a rifle and three with the pistol. The first event, the military rifle, was won by Pantelis Karasevdas, the only competitor to hit the target with all of his shots. The second event, for military pistols, was dominated by two American brothers: John and Sumner Paine became the first siblings to finish first and second in the same event. In order to avoid embarrassing their hosts, the brothers decided that only one of them would compete in the next pistol event, the free pistol. Sumner Paine won that event.

The Paine brothers did not compete in the 25 meter pistol event, as the event judges determined that their weapons were not of the required caliber. In their absence, Ioannis Phrangoudis won. The final event, the free rifle, began on the same day. However, the event was not completed due to darkness and was finalized the next morning, when Georgios Orphanidis was crowned the champion.

The swimming competition was held in the open sea. Nearly 20,000 spectators lined the Bay of Zea off the Piraeus coast to watch the events. The water in the bay was cold, and the competitors suffered during their races. There were three open events (men's 100 metre freestyle, men's 500 metre freestyle, and men's 1200 metre freestyle), in addition to a special event open only to Greek sailors, all of which were held on the same day (April 11).

For Alfréd Hajós of Hungary, being on the same day meant he could only compete in two of the events. He won the two events in which he swam, the 100 and 1200 meter freestyle. Hajós later became one of only two Olympians to win a medal in both the athletic and artistic competitions, when he won a silver medal for architecture in 1924. The 500 meter freestyle was won by Austrian swimmer Paul Neumann, who defeated his opponents by more than a minute and a half.

Although tennis was already a major sport by the end of the 19th century, none of the top players turned up for the tournament in Athens. The competition was at the courts of the Athens Lawn Tennis Club, and the infield of the velodrome used for the cycling events. John Pius Boland, who won the event, was entered in the competition by a fellow-student of his at Oxford. In the first round, Boland defeated Friedrich Traun, a promising tennis player from Hamburg, who had been eliminated in the 100 meter sprint competition. Boland and Traun decided to team up for the doubles event, in which they reached the final and defeated their Greek and Egyptian opponents after losing the first set.

The sport of weightlifting was still young in 1896, and the rules differed from those in use today. Competitions were held outdoors, in the infield of the main stadium, and there were no weight limits. The first event was held in a style now known as the "clean and jerk". Two competitors stood out: Scotsman Launceston Elliot and Viggo Jensen of Denmark. Both of them lifted the same weight; but the jury, with Prince George as the chairman, ruled that Jensen had done so in a better style. The British delegation, unfamiliar with this tie-breaking rule, lodged a protest. The lifters were eventually allowed to make further attempts, but neither lifter improved, and Jensen was declared the champion.

Elliot won in the one hand lift event, which was held immediately after the two-handed one. Jensen had been slightly injured during his last two-handed attempt, and was no match for Elliot, who won the competition easily. The Greek audience was charmed by the Scottish victor, whom they considered very attractive. A curious incident occurred during the weightlifting event: a servant was ordered to remove the weights, which appeared to be a difficult task for him. Prince George came to his assistance; he picked up the weight and threw it a considerable distance with ease, to the delight of the crowd.

No weight classes existed for the wrestling competition, held in the Panathinaiko Stadium, which meant that there would only be one winner among competitors of all sizes. The rules used were similar to modern Greco-Roman wrestling, although there was no time limit, and not all leg holds were forbidden (in contrast to current rules).

Apart from the two Greek contestants, all the competitors had previously been active in other sports. Weightlifting champion Launceston Elliot faced gymnastics champion Carl Schuhmann. The latter won and advanced into the final, where he met Georgios Tsitas, who had previously defeated Stephanos Christopoulos. Darkness forced the final match to be suspended after 40 minutes; it was continued the following day, when Schuhmann needed only a quarter of an hour to finish the bout.
On the morning of Sunday April 12, King George organized a banquet for officials and athletes (even though some competitions had not yet been held). During his speech, he made clear that, as far as he was concerned, the Olympics should be held in Athens permanently. The official closing ceremony was held the following Wednesday, after being postponed from Tuesday due to rain. Again the royal family attended the ceremony, which was opened by the national anthem of Greece and an ode composed in ancient Greek by George S. Robertson, a British athlete and scholar.

Afterwards, the king awarded prizes to the winners. Unlike today, the first place winners received silver medals, an olive branch and a diploma. Athletes who placed second received copper medals, a branch of laurel and a diploma. Third place winners did not receive a medal. Some winners also received additional prizes, such as Spyridon Louis, who received a cup from Michel Bréal, a friend of Coubertin, who had conceived the marathon event. Louis then led the medalists on a lap of honor around the stadium, while the Olympic Hymn was played again. The King then formally announced that the first Olympiad was at an end, and left the Stadium, while the band played the Greek national hymn and the crowd cheered.

Like the Greek king, many others supported the idea of holding the next Games in Athens; most of the American competitors signed a letter to the Crown Prince expressing this wish. Coubertin, however, was heavily opposed to this idea, as he envisioned international rotation as one of the cornerstones of the modern Olympics. According to his wish, the next Games were held in Paris, although they would be somewhat over-shadowed by the concurrently held Universal Exposition.

Makalani

Makalani is the name given to a certain palm tree, growing in northern Namibia (Southern Africa). The local Owambo people call a full grown palm tree "Omulunga" and a sapling "Oshivale." These palm trees grow very high and it takes many years for a Makalani sapling to grow into a full-grown tree.

The seeds look like small coconuts, and the local people, the Owambos and Himbas, peel the outer ginger looking skin and carve the inner hard core to certain objects of art. The inner core is white with a dark brown skin, the size of a golf ball, and it is hollow inside. The Makalani fruit (Ondunga/Onduga)is very useful to the local people. It can be eaten and can also be used to brew Ombike/Owalende: the Oshiwambo brew that looks and taste similar to Whiskey. 
There are now also some hotels, restaurants, and guesthouses which have adopted the name Makalani (in Namibia).

<doc id="39238" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39238" title="Bow (music)">
Bow (music)

In music, a bow is a stick which is strung with hair. It is used to pull across the strings of a string instrument such as a violin, viola, cello or double bass. 

The wood used for good quality bows is usually pernambuco wood from Brazil. Some bows nowadays are made from fibreglass. They are often cheaper and still of very good quality. The bow has to be slightly curved so that it straightens out a bit as the hairs are tightened (this is like the bow of ‘bow and arrow’ where letting go of the tension of the bent bow makes the arrow fly off). 

Horsehair is used for the hairs of the bow. These hairs gradually fall out when the bow is used a lot. When a lot of the hairs have fallen out the player can have the bow re-haired. When the bow is new, or when it has just been re-haired, it will not make any sound until the hairs have been well rubbed with rosin (also called “colophony”). The rosin makes the hair grip the string as it is drawn across. Every violinist needs to keep a piece of rosin (called a “cake of rosin”) in his or her violin case. They may need to rosin the bow for a short while each time they play. There is a screw at the end of the bow for tightening the hairs. After playing, the bow hairs should be slackened again before the bow is put away. This is to stop the wood from warping (bending out of shape).

The black bit near the heel of the bow (the end where the player holds it) is called the frog. This holds the hair in place. The frog may be made of ebony, but sometimes it is made of ivory or tortoiseshell. Near the frog is the grip, which is made of leather or sometimes snakeskin. Expensive bows sometimes have a tip made of silver.

There are other instruments which use bows. In the Renaissance the viols were played with a bow which was held with the palm upwards. Some double bass players still hold the bow in this way (this is called the German method. The overhand method is called the French method.)

The kind of bow in use today was developed by the bow-maker François Tourte in 19th century France.

There are other cultures which have bows with only one thick hair.

People who learn to play the violin, viola, violoncello, and double bass spend a very long time learning the technique of bowing. They have to learn to control the bow so that it makes a lovely sound on the string. They learn to control the bow with strong fingers, but never to hold the bow tightly. Sometimes they are asked to pluck the string instead of bowing it. This is called “pizzicato”.

The bow is held in the right hand. The left hand makes the different notes by putting the fingers firmly down on the fingerboard.

When string players talk about “putting in the bowing” they mean: writing in the music for each note whether it is played with an upbow or downbow. A downbow is when the player starts at the heel (the end that he is holding) and finishes at the tip. An upbow is when the bow travels in the direction tip to heel. A player does not always have to use “whole bows” (from the heel to the tip). In fast music he may only use a small part of the bow. A downbow feels stronger than an upbow, so it is usually used for the first beat of the bar. Downbows and upbows may be used for alternate notes, but often two or more notes are taken in one bow-stroke. This is shown in the music by a slur (a short curved line like a phrase mark over or under the notes to be slurred).

The bow generally should touch the part of the string mid-way between the end of the fingerboard and the bridge (see the article violin). To play quietly the bow should be nearer the fingerboard. To play loudly it should be nearer the bridge.

When the players have been plucking ("pizzicato") and they need to start bowing again, the word "arco" is put in the music. This is the Italian word for "bow".

Special effects can be made with the bow. These include: 

The Chinese yazheng and "yaqin", and Korean ajaeng zithers are generally played by "bowing" with a rosined stick, which rubs against the strings without any horsehair. The hurdy-gurdy, an instrument known in medieval Europe, has strings which are bowed by a "rosin wheel," which is turned by a handle.

Bowing

Bowing means: taking a bow. A bow is when a person bends their body forward from the waist in order to greet someone or show respect for them. A bow is sometimes not much more than a quick nod of the head, but it can be a very deep bow from the waist. The exact way to bow and the situations in which people bow vary enormously between different cultures. 

Bowing was originally a gesture (a movement of the body) which showed deep respect for someone. In European cultures bowing to someone is now only done in very formal situations, e.g. when meeting the Queen or someone very high and important.

In European history bowing was common at royal courts. Men were expected to "bow and scrape". This meant bowing and at the same time drawing back the right leg so that it scraped the floor. The man would hold his left hand over his waist while doing this. This is why we still talk about "bowing and scraping" meaning that someone is trying very hard and hypocritically to be unnecessarily polite. This kind of deep bow, which is never used nowadays, is sometimes called a “reverence” (a word meaning: “deep respect”).

Bowing was only done by men. Women would always curtsey to show respect.

Nowadays bowing in European cultures is mostly seen at performances. When people applaud (clap their hands) after a performance such as a concert on in the theatre the performer will take a bow. This is like saying “thank you” to the audience for saying “thank you” by clapping. Both men and women performers bow (although female ballet dancers will curtsey).

In Christian worship people in churches will bow to the altar to show respect to Jesus.

There are other special occasions in which people bow. In judo and some other martial arts the two contestants (people who are going to fight) will bow to one another to show that they respect one another and will obey the rules of the game.

In some Asian cultures bowing is far more common than in the West. It is especially important in Japan. Japanese people – both men and women - spend a lot of their time bowing. They bow to greet one another, to say goodbye, to say they are sorry, to say ‘thank you’, or to show that they are not as important as the person they are bowing to. There are different degrees of bowing, and it is very important in Japanese culture to know the right way to bow on different occasions. A bow of 15 degrees is very informal, a bow of 45 degrees is very formal. They keep their back (from the head to the hips) straight while doing this. The men have their hands by their sides, women have one hand over the other in front of their body. Typically a bow should last a count of eight: three to go down, one for a pause and four for returning to an upright position. If someone bows a little longer than the other person, that other person may bow again, and the other person then also bows again, and this can go on several times. Japanese mothers carry their babies on their backs, so that children learn to bow even before they can speak. Pupils and teachers at school bow to one another. The more important someone is, the deeper the other person has to bow.

Exaggeration

Exaggeration means the describing of something and making it more than it really is. The verb is to exaggerate.

An example of exaggeration would be: “I was walking along when suddenly this enormous dog walked along. It was as big as an elephant”. The dog may have been big, but it was certainly not as big as that. Another example of exaggeration would be: “I caught a fish as big as my house.”

Overstatement is another word that means almost the same thing. The opposite of overstatement is understatement. 

A hyperbole (IPA:[haı'pɝ.bə.li]) is a type of exaggeration that is used in literature. It is a figure of speech. The opposite of hyperbole is hypobole, which is an understatement.

People exaggerate things because they have strong feelings about something. People may exaggerate to make people listen to what they say. They may do it to emphasize something. They may also exaggerate just to sound funny:

People may understate because they are being modest:

<doc id="39282" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39282" title="Meiosis">
Meiosis

Meiosis is a special type of cell division. Unlike mitosis, the way normal body cells divide, meiosis results in cells that only have half the usual number of chromosomes, one from each pair. For that reason, meiosis is often called "reduction division". In the long run, meiosis increases genetic variation, in a way which will be explained later. 

Sexual reproduction takes place when a sperm fertilizes an egg. The eggs and sperm are special cells called gametes, or sex cells. Gametes are haploid; they have only half the number of chromosomes as a normal body cell (called a somatic cell). Fertilization restores the chromosomes in body cells to the diploid number.

The basic number of chromosomes in the body cells of a species is called the "somatic number" and is designated "2n". Thus, in humans 2n = 46. We have 46 chromosomes. In the sex cells the chromosome number is "n" (humans: n = 23). So, in normal diploid organisms, chromosomes are present in two copies, one from each parent (23x2=46). The only exception are the sex chomosomes. In mammals, the female has two X chromosomes, and the male one X and one Y chromosome.

A "karyotype" is the characteristic chromosome number of a eukaryote species. The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of cytogenetics, the genetics of cells.

All eukaryotes that reproduce sexually use meiosis. This also includes single-celled organisms. Meiosis does not occur in archaea or bacteria, which reproduce via asexual processes such as binary fission.

The offspring gets a set of chromosomes from each parent so that, overall, half of its heredity comes from each parent. But the two sets of chromosomes are not identical with the parental chromosomes. This is because they are changed during the reduction division by a process called "crossing-over".

This is two-fold:

1. First, to reduce the chromosomes in each egg or sperm to one set only.
2. To allow crossing-over to take place between each pair of parental chromosomes. Crossing-over changes which alleles sit on a particular chromosome.

Although the gametes have only one set of chromosomes, that set is a shuffled mixture of genetic material from both parents. Every single egg or sperm may have a different selection of alleles from the parental chromosomes. 

As with shuffling a deck of cards, many different combinations of genes can be produced without a change (mutation) in any individual gene. However, mutations do occur, and they may add alleles which were not in the population before. At any rate, the shuffling increases the variety of the offspring, and the variety gives at least some of the offspring a better chance of surviving in difficult times. The shuffling of alleles which takes place in meiosis may be the reason why sexual reproduction exists at all.

Several quite large taxa (groups of organisms) use cyclical parthenogenesis. This is when several generations are born by virgin birth, and then a generation occurs with normal sexual reproduction. Examples include aphids, and cladocerans (small crustacea called "water fleas"). Aphids usually operate as follows: when the weather is good, and their plant hosts are at their best, they use parthenogenesis. At the end of the season, when the weather gets worse, they use sexual reproduction. This system of reproduction is called "apogamy".

In parthenogenesis, the eggs contain only the mother's genetic material, and they are not fertilized. The egg cells may be produced either by meiosis or mitosis. When meiosis occurs, crossing-over produces a genetic fingerprint which differs somewhat from the mother's. So, the parthenogenetic greenfly offspring are not identical, and do show some genetic variation: some chromosome segments differ because of meiosis. Mitosis would produce identical offspring.

Amongst these parthenogenetic taxa are a number of species which have entirely abandoned sex.

A few eukaryote organisms have completely lost the ability for sexual reproduction, and so do not have meiosis. These include the Bdelloid rotifers, which only reproduce by parthenogenesis.

Meiosis can be divided into Meiosis I and Meiosis II.

The function of the first division is to permit crossing over. Just like Mitosis, meiosis includes Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase and Telophase.

"Prophase I:" The chromosomes become visible, the nuclear envelope disappears and the centrioles (located at the top and bottom of the nucleus) begin forming spindle fibres that envelope the chromosomes.

At this stage each chromosome is split into two sister chromatids, held together by the centromeres. The paired chromosomes now have four chromatids (2 sets of 'sisters') pressed together. Crossing over takes place between two of the non-sister chromatids; the other two remain uncrossed. The crossover results in the exchange of segments of each of the participating chromatids, DNA and associated chromatin protein. Genetically, the process is called recombination. 
"Metaphase I:" The chromosomes line up along the equatorial (the central line) of the spindle fibres in homologous pairs.

"Anaphase I:" The chromosomes are divided so that there are equal amounts on either side of the cell. As there are 46 chromosomes in a human cell, 23 end up on either side.

"(Cytokinesis, the division of cells into two, takes place. The cell divides.)"

"Telophase I:" The two daughter cells are completely divided, a nucleic envelope forms and the chromosomes become less visible. There are 23 chromosomes in each of these cells.

The two cells prepare to divide again in a stage known as Interkinesis or Interphase II. Both of these cells will go through meiosis II.

"Prophase II:" The chromosomes become visible, the nuclear envelope disappears and the centrioles form the spindle fibres.

"Metaphase II:" The chromosomes line up along the middle line on the spindle fibres

"Anaphase II:" The chromosomes get split into its two chromatids. Chromatids are the two strands of DNA (deoxyribo-nucleic acid) that make up the chromosome. They are joined by a mid-way connection called a centromere.

"(Cytokinesis takes place. The cell divides.)"

"Telophase II:" The cells are completely divided. The nucleic envelope reforms and four new cells with different DNA are created.

In males, all four cells become sperm. In females, only one becomes a mature egg, while the remaining three become re-absorbed into the body.

In humans, there are certain conditions that are caused by a meiosis gone wrong. Examples are:

Gainsharing

Gainsharing is a system of management used by a business to get higher levels of performance through the and participation of its people. As performance improves, employees share financially in the gain (improvement). Gainsharing is about people working smarter together and not just working harder. 

Gainsharing should not be confused with profit sharing. There are many differences between Gainsharing and profit sharing. Gainsharing is also called Gain sharing, Gainshare, and Gain share. It could also be called "savings sharing." In other words, a company shares with employees the savings from improved performance.

There are two important parts of a Gainsharing system. One is a bonus calculation. The second is a structured system for employee involvement. Because of these two parts, Gainsharing is best seen as an "organizational development" tool. It is not just a bonus or "incentive plan." In order to get a better understanding of this concept one needs to look back at Gainsharing's history. 

One of the first Gainsharing plans dates back to the 1930's. In the 1930's a labor leader and MIT Lecturer Joe Scanlon, preached that “the worker” had much more to offer than just a "pair of hands" (manual labor). Scanlon believed that the person closest to the problem often has the best and simplest solution. Also, if the worker is involved in the solution he will make the solution work. 

In an effort to help a troubled company, Scanlon and the company owner asked employees' for their ideas and suggestions to help reduce waste and lower cost. Many improvements were made. The company became more successful. Joe was asked to save other companies who had barely survived the depression. He eventually became the Acting Director of the Steelworkers Research Department and used his skills in creating joint labor/management improvement committees to help the war effort for WWII.

After the war Joe became a lecturer at MIT and went on to develop a system for organizational development and gainsharing that became known as the Scanlon Plan.

As the Scanlon Plan developed a method to measure (calculate) gains (improvements) was created. The monetary gains were then shared with all employees. This calculation represents the bonus (monetary incentive) element of Gainsharing. This concept addresses the principle of equity. "It is fair to share." Everyone in a company makes a contribution to the organization's success. Why limit bonuses to the select few? People typically take pride in their work and have a strong desire to be respected for what they do. By sharing the company is communicating an important message to the work force: "We all contribute. That contribution is respected. Let's share in the financial benefits." 

Articles in Time, Fortune and Life Magazines and the work of Joe

Today, companies with a Gainsharing plan measure performance. Companies use a pre-determined calculation (formula) to share the savings with all employees. Information regarding the measures, formula, and gains (savings) is regularly and openly shared with all employees. Since the monetary gains are shared with employees, people develop more of a sense of ownership for their work and the company. People have a better understanding of how they influence the company's success.

It should be noted that in a Gainsharing plan that the company's current performance is compared to its historic performance (baseline period). The savings above the baseline period determine the gain or loss. This is a very important point. Since gains are measured in relationship to a historical period, employees and the company must improve in order to make a gain. Otherwise, the current level of performance would be equal to the baseline period. If this happened the result would be, "no gain and no employee share (monetary award)."

When people do their work differently they must change. However, as everyone one knows, it is difficult for people to change. On the other hand, do people like money? Most people would say, "Yes." Therefore, Gainsharing can be a very powerful tool. Gainsharing promotes a culture of positive change. 

A very important part of a successful Gainsharing plan is the employee involvement element of Gainsharing. In order to foster a culture of positive change, a successful Gainsharing plan needs to incorporate a structure system of employee involvement. It is common for Gainsharing plans to have a "team-based" suggestion system in place. 

How does a team-based suggestion system work? First, teams are formed in order to gather suggestions from employees on ways to improve, (in other words, suggestions on how to work "smarter"). The teams are permanent groups. The teams meet on a regular basis to discuss the ideas and suggestions. They make decisions on approving or declining the ideas. Also the teams are given limited spending authority to approve and implement the suggestions. Suggestions that are approved by a team, but are beyond their spending authority, are advanced to a higher level in the organization for final approval. Unlike a traditional suggestion system, a team-based system does not provide individual monetary rewards. This is because everyone works together and shares in the gain together. Gainsharing is not an individual incentive plan. 

In terms of the calculation, a Gainsharing plan may have from one to six key performance measures. Examples of measures include productivity, quality, waste, spending, and customer service. The gains (savings) from each measure are calculated separately. Then gains and losses from each measure are added to determine the total gain. A portion of the total gain goes to the company and a portion is shared with all employees. Generally, from 10% to 50% of the gain is shared with employees. The percent of the gain shared with employees depends on employee controllability and importance of the measure to the organization. The pool is distributed to all participants, typically on a monthly or quarterly frequency. 

It is also very important to note that the development and implementation of a Gainsharing plan often involves employees. An employee committee called the "Design Team" helps to make policy decisions on issues such as the plan's measures, employee eligibility, frequency of payout, and method of communication. Next the design team gets upper management approval before implementation. After approval, the Design Team is responsible for conducting meetings with all employees to communicate the details of the plan. Follow-up training should also take place.

The following summarizes many of the elements of a Gainsharing plan which have been discussed. 


In summary companies with successful Gainsharing plans view Gainsharing as much more than a bonus or incentive system. Instead, they see the system as an important part of their business strategy and a method to drive organization change. Gainsharing can be a powerful tool if installed and managed by a company that truly believes in its people.

Book of Mormon

The Book of Mormon is a book that Latter Day Saints believe is the word of God along with the Bible.

The original English version of the Book of Mormon was published in March 1830 by a man named Joseph Smith, Jr. who claimed to be a prophet like the ones in the Old Testament.

Joseph Smith said that he translated the book into English from gold plates given to him by an angel. The book claims that the language it was first written in was made from "the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians."

The story contained in the Book of Mormon is a shortened version written by a man named Mormon of the record of two groups of people called the Nephites and the Lamanites. Their ancestors left Jerusalem with their father Lehi about 600 years before the birth of Christ, sailed across a very big ocean, and settled in the New World. It gives an account of their families, cities, wars, systems of government, spiritual experiences and religious beliefs among other things. The main purpose of the Book of Mormon is to teach about Jesus Christ.

It also contains the Book of Ether (a very old book discovered by the Nephites) which told the story of another people (called the Jaredites) who had lived in some of the same areas shortly after the time of the Tower of Babel, but died out because of wars.

Usually, Book of Mormon stories show the Nephites as the more righteous, industrious and peaceful people and the Lamanites as wicked, lazy and warlike. Wars happen all the time between the two groups. But, near the end of the book, the Nephites become more wicked than the Lamanites, and all the Nephites die in their last war, except for one named Moroni who was directed by God to bury the Book of Mormon in a hill so that Joseph Smith Jr. could find it.

The central theme of the book revolves around Jesus Christ visiting the people described, performing miracles and showing them the right way to live.

Cúcuta

Cúcuta (pron. IPA koo`koo-tä), or San Jose de Cúcuta, is the capital of the Norte de Santander Department, in Colombia. Cúcuta is an important city in northeastern Colombia because of where it is; on the border with Venezuela. People from Cúcuta are called "cucuteños".

The area has grown fast since the 1960s, especially the suburbs of Villa del Rosario and Los Patios.

Adding also to the city's progress and development that had not been seen in 20 years with the building of six overpasses, a convention center, a new bus terminal, a new Integrated Massive Transportation System called Metrobus, the modernization of state owned schools, the recovery of Cucuta's downtown, and the duplication of the capacity for the General Santander Stadium. And the expectation over new industries that will come from Venezuela and will place their factories in Cucuta aimming at exporting through the Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement between Colombia and the United States..

Simón Bolívar captured Cúcuta in 1813 and set out from there on his march to Caracas. At Cúcuta the constituent congress of 1821 met to draft the constitution of Greater Colombia (present day Venezuela, Ecuador and Colombia).

The city was largely destroyed by an earthquake on 18 May 1875, but was soon rebuilt.

In 1939 Cúcuta had a population of 59,323 people; in 1990 it had 532,564, and in 2005 the metropolitan area had a population of 950,000.

The battle of Cúcuta was not important as military day, but by the moral importance that took Bolivar advantage to release to Venezuela.

Batalla began at 9:00 AM of the 28 of February of 1813 and finished noon. The combatants: 400 men to the control of Simón Bolivar and 800 to orders of Spanish General Ramon Correa.

Two dead and 14 hurt of liberating troops and 20 dead and 40 hurts of the Spanish troops. 

Also known as the Earthquake of the Andes. It happened the May 18 of 1875 at 11:15 AM. It completely destroyed Cúcuta, Villa del Rosario, San Antonio del Tachira and Capacho also causing serious damages in the Venezuelan populations of San Cristóbal, La Mulata, Rubio, Michelena, La Grita, Colón, among others and was felt in Bogota and Caracas.

Cúcuta is located on a plateau in the Cordillera Oriental of the Colombian Andes. The official metropolitan area includes the municipalities of: Villa del Rosario, Los Patios, El Zulia, and Puerto Santander. All four neighboring municipalities contain extensive rural areas despite recent urbanization.[citation]

The city of Cúcuta is plain toward the north and mountainous in its edges and in its central part, especially toward the south, where presents for the east the following mountains, removed of the eastern mountain range of the Colombian Andes.

Cúcuta and Norte de Santander have many rivers, none of them with pollution problems, being the Pamplonita River, the Guaramito River, the San Miguel River and the Zulia River de most important.

Cúcuta is a city with a big demographic growth, because it had 387.481 inhabitants at 1951 and now has a population of 1.196.775.

Cúcuta has an agroindustry that mainly produces milk products and liquors, construction has boomed in recent years, but it's a net commercial city due to its condition of border city with Venezuela. Thanks to it the major Colombian commercial centers, banks, and warehouses have offices in the city.

US - Colombia Free Trade Agreement implications for Cúcuta

Colombia signed a Free Trade Agreement with the United States to the opposition of Venezuela. Despite its opposition, industries from that country are constructing their infrastructure in Cúcuta to export their products to the United States, registering their products as if they were Colombian, an strategy that would allow them to export without paying certain tariffs. For that reason, Cúcuta is thought to become an industrial city. 

This process in individual, appears by the legal norm of Colombia that allows exemptions in taxes to make but competitive to the region (through the "Zona Franca"), in addition that the own geographic characteristics of the area at issue you appear greater possibilities of exporting products through position of Maracaibo (Venezuela).

Cúcuta has a municipal area of 1176 km² and is located at 302 above sea level. The average temperature of 28°C (82.4°F) with an average humidity of 65%. Its medium annual precipitation is of 1,041mm. There are two rain seasons, between March-May and September-November. The dry months of the year are December and January with a medium precipitation of 58mm. 

Cúcuta is also known as the "Ciudad sin fronteras" (City without borders), "La ciudad de los arboles" (The city of the threes), "La hermosa villa" (The beautiful ville), y "Ciudad verde" (Green city)

The city is served by one transportation terminal and the Camilo Daza Airport, which is located north of the city. In general, the more prosperous areas are along and above west (Caobos, La Riviera and some places of the center) and to the east. 

The state owned university, the Francisco de Paula Santander University (UFPS), is in the northeastern part of the city; there are several private universities of varying quality.

Many important personalities from Colombia are from Cúcuta such as the first President of Colombia, Francisco de Paula Santander, known as "the man of the laws" and Fabiola Zuluaga, the best Colombian tennis player, Virgilio Barco, a former president of Colombia, some actors like Lincoln Palomeque, Endry Carreño, Manolo Suñiga, and the musician Elias M. Soto.

Main parks




The generation of cucuteños (people from Cúcuta) and the legion of foreigners who reconstructed the city after the 1875 earthquake planted trees which grew fruits called clemones that had acid and bitter fruits with which the boys played.

Soon they were replaced by acacias, peracos and almonds tree. In the historical course of the arborization of the city, different stages as far as the spices have been marked that have been used in the ornamentación.

In Cúcuta the love for the trees is preached and applied, and cucuteño (people from Cúcuta) respect someone who has planted one in front of his house. For this reason Cúcuta is well-known like the city forest of Colombia.

The basic education and the high school education are in Colombian "Calendary A" for schools (from February to November).

Recursion

Recursion is a word from mathematics. In mathematics and in computer science, it is used to define a thing, usually a function. Unlike with normal definitions, the function to be defined can be used to define itself.

Recursion consists of two steps:

Monte Carlo algorithm

A Monte Carlo algorithm is an algorithm for computers. It is used to simulate the behaviour of other systems. It is not an exact method, but a heuristical one. Usually it uses randomness and statistics to get a result. 

It is a computation process that uses random numbers to produce an outcome(s). Instead of having fixed inputs, probability distributions are assigned to some or all of the inputs. This will generate a probability distribution for the output after the simulation is run.

Mailing list

Some people, or organisations, like companies have many addresses of different people. They use these addresses to send the same mail to these addresses they have. In the postal system, using regular mail, such mailing lists are used to distribute these mails, which may be wanted (like newspapers) or unwanted (advertising). 

In the electronic form, these differences also exist. Bulk mailings (SPAM) is distributed using mailing lists. On the other hand there are mailing lists people subscribe to. Every time, someone sends a mail to the mailing list, this mail is distributed to all people who are on the list. The Software which manages such a mailing list sometimes offers options to the people who subscribe. Instead of getting each mail directly, they might want only one mail (per day). This mail then contains all the mails of that day. This is called a "digest".

Also, mails that come from people on the list might be handled differently from mails from people who are not subscribed to the mailing list.

Mailing lists are a way to reach selected groups of people - by specific parameters (or markets) - through the United States Post Office. The population may be broken into sections organized buy their unique qualities such as "catalog purchasers" or "business owners," or by geographic area such as businesses or residents in a particular city or zip code, or buy select statistical parameters such as businesses with over 20 employees, or heads of household with income of over $80,000. Direct Mail Lists are then sold to direct marketing companies wishing to make an offer to this specific segment of the population. By tightly specifying the parameters of the mailing list, direct mail is a very effective way to market to a precisely selected group with little wasted advertising expense.

Electrochemistry

Electrochemistry is a kind of chemistry that studies chemical reactions that use or make electricity: Reactions like this happen at "electrodes" which are made from something that conducts electricity, and put in an "electrolyte". An electrolyte is a solution that has ions in it.

Electrochemistry was "invented" at the same time as the voltaic pile; the first kind of electric battery.

Sulfuric acid

Sulfuric acid, also known as sulphuric acid, is a strong acid. It is also a chemical compound. It's chemical formula is HSO. It was known as "Oil of Vitriol" in ancient times. 

It is a thick clear liquid that can dissolve in water. 

It was once known as "oil of vitriol". This name was created by Jabir ibn Hayyan, the person who discovered it. It used to be prepared by the reaction of potassium nitrate with sulfur. This reaction would produce sulfur trioxide which would dissolve in steam to produce sulfuric acid. Then this reaction was done in lead containers. The contact process, the most common process, was invented in 1831 and is still used today.

It is made by reacting sulfur trioxide with sulfuric acid to produce oleum. Then oleum is dissolved in water to produce more sulfuric acid. The sulfur trioxide is produced by burning sulfur to produce sulfur dioxide, which was then oxidized to sulfur trioxide with a catalyst. This process is called the contact process.

Sulfuric acid has many uses, and is made more than any other chemical besides water. World production in 2001 was 165 million tons, worth about $8 billion US dollars. Uses include ore processing, fertilizer manufacturing, oil refining, wastewater processing, lead acid batteries, and combining chemicals for scientific reasons. For example, phosphate rocks are reacted with sulfuric acid to produce soluble phosphates, useful in fertilizers. This reaction is also used to make phosphoric acid, useful in soda. Potassium compounds are dissolved in sulfuric acid to produce potassium sulfate, useful in fertilizers. Ammonia is also reacted with sulfuric acid to produce ammonium sulfate. These three chemicals are solids and provide the three main minerals needed in plants. Lead acid batteries use sulfuric acid as their electrolyte. 

Sulfuric acid is very poisonous because of its acidity and corrosiveness. When it is mixed with sugar, it turns it into carbon. When it is dissolved in water, it becomes less harmful (does not make things black) but is still corrosive like normal acids. It reacts with metals to produce hydrogen and the metal sulfate. Some metals, such as tin, make sulfur dioxide and tin(II) sulfate. It reacts with sodium chloride to make hydrogen chloride.

Jew

A Jew is a person who is of Jewish heritage. Jews typically consider themselves as a separate nation rather than just adherents of a religion, therefore a Jew is not only one that practices the religion of Judaism, but it is also one who is of Jewish heritage. According to the Jewish Halakha, someone is Jewish if their mother was a Jew. 

The word Jew originally meant people from the ancient Kingdom of Judea (where Israel is today). After most Judeans were forced out by the Romans, the word started to mean people of the Jewish religion, and not just those from Judea.

Israel is the only Jewish country, but there are Jewish minorities in many places in the world. Most of them live in large cities in the United States, Argentina, Europe and Australia. Both Israel and the U.S. have over five million Jews.Russia used to also have millions of Jews, but most of them moved to Israel or the U.S., or were killed in the Holocaust.

Jews have been victims of various persecutions. The one that happened during the Second World War is known as The Holocaust.

Many Jews have gone on to do great things in science, literature, business, and the arts. Some of the most famous include:

Gough Whitlam

Edward Gough Whitlam (born 11 July 1916) was the 21st Prime Minister of Australia. , and the only Prime Minister to have been dismissed from office by a Governor-General. He was Prime Minister for three years. His Labor Party was elected after 23 years of government by the Liberal-Country Party Coalition, and his government made a lot of new changes. Gough Whitlam married Margaret Whitlam in 1942 and they have remained married ever since.

His government, for most of the time it lasted, did not have a majority in the Senate (the upper house of the Australian Parliament). This made it hard for Whitlam's government to make laws. In 1975 the government thought about borrowing US$4 billion in foreign loans. One cabinet minister, Rex Connor, had secret discussions with a loan broker from Pakistan. The Treasurer, Jim Cairns, misled parliament over this. Partly as a result, the new leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Fraser, use the Senate to stop passing money for the government until there was an election. In 1975 the opposition, led by Fraser, blocked government supply in the Senate. This meant that the government had no money with which to pay civil servants and carry out administration. In order to end the crisis the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, dismissed Whitlam and made Fraser the temporary Prime Minister. Whitlam was easily defeated by Fraser in the election that was held a month later. He was defeated for a second time by Fraser at the next election in 1977, and resigned from parliament shortly after that. Since then he has continued to be a very public figure, writing books and often commenting on political affairs.

Whitlam is one of the most controversial people in Australia. Many people think of him as a hero while others consider his government to have been inefficient.

John Kerr

Sir John Robert Kerr (24 September 1914 – 24 March 1991) was the 18th Governor-General of Australia from 1974-1977. He is famous for dismissing Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in 1975. This is one of the most famous events in Australian history. Even though the Whitlam government was not voted back in after being dismissed, Kerr's actions divided opinion and he continued to be disliked by many people.

Prime Minister Gough Whitlam chose John Kerr to be Governor General in 1974. In 1974–75 the Whitlam government thought about borrowing US$4 billion in foreign loans. A Minister, Rex Connor, had secret discussions with a loan broker from Pakistan. The Treasurer, Jim Cairns, misled parliament about this. This made the new leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Fraser use the Senate to stop passing money for the government until there was an election. Whitlam refused. In 1975 the opposition, led by Malcolm Fraser, blocked government supply in the Senate. This meant that the government had no money. This was a big crisis in Australia. In order to end the crisis, John Kerr dismissed Whitlam and made Fraser the Prime Minister. Whitlam lost the election that was held a month later.
