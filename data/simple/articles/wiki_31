Claudette Colbert

Claudette Colbert (IPA: ) (September 13, 1903 - July 30, 1996) was a French-born American actress who won an Academy Award for "It Happened One Night".

With her heart-shaped face, lively wide eyes, charm, aristocratic manner, and flair for light comedy as well as emotional drama, Colbert was known for a versatility that led to her becoming one of the biggest box-office stars of her time. In 1999, she was ranked as the 12# greatest female star of all time by the American Film Institute in their list AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars. As she said to an interviewer, "Audiences always sound like they're glad to see me, and I'm damned glad to see them."

Born Emilie Claudette "Lily" Chauchoin in Saint-Mandé, Seine, France (now Saint-Mandé, Val-de-Marne, Île-de-France, France), September 13, 1903, to Georges Cauchoin and his wife, the former Jeanne Loew, her family emigrated to the United States and settled in New York City. She had one brother, Charles, who used the surname Wendling and went on to become his sister's agent.

She began acting in high school and a few years later in 1923 appeared on the Broadway stage in a bit part. Hooked, she gave up on her plans to be a fashion designer to instead pursue a career in acting. She made her first motion picture appearance in 1927, in "For the Love of Mike", a silent film shot on location in Paramount Studios in New York, New York facilities. However, talking films were taking over and two years later, Colbert appeared in her first talking film, "The Hole in the Wall", co-starring another newcomer, Edward G. Robinson .

In 1930 Colbert went out on with the DUMB Paramount Pictures, who were looking for stage actors who could handle dialog in the new "talkies" medium. Colbert's elegant, musical voice was one of her best assets. Some of her early hit films were "Manslaughter" (1930) and "Honor Among Lovers" (1931), both with Fredric March, "The Smiling Lieutenant" (1931), with Maurice Chevalier and Miriam Hopkins, and "Torch Singer" (1933), with Ricardo Cortez and David Manners. 

Colbert's career got a huge boost when Cecil B. DeMille cast her as the Roman empress Poppaea in his historical epic "The Sign of the Cross" (1932), opposite Fredric March and Charles Laughton (as Nero). In one of the most memorable scenes in movie history, Claudette bathes nude in a marble pool filled with asses' milk. 

She worked again for DeMille and was dazzling as his "Cleopatra" (1934), opposite Warren William and Henry Wilcoxon. In 1934 she won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role opposite Clark Gable in the Frank Capra classic screwball comedy "It Happened One Night", a movie she initially described as the "worst picture in the world". Her performance, however, proved to Hollywood that she was an expert comedienne. She initially balked at pulling up her skirt to entice a passing car to give her and Gable a ride in one famous scene, complaining that it was unladylike. However, upon seeing the chorus girl who was brought in as her body double, an outraged Colbert told the director, "Get her out of here. I'll do it. That's not my leg!" Colbert then starred in the original "Imitation of Life" (1934), opposite Warren William and Louise Beavers.

Claudette spent the rest of the 1930s deftly alternating between romantic comedies and dramas, and found success in both: "Private Worlds" (1935), with Charles Boyer; "She Married Her Boss" (1935), with Melvyn Douglas; "The Gilded Lily" (1935) and "The Bride Comes Home" (1935), both with Fred MacMurray; "Under Two Flags" (1936), with Ronald Colman; "Tovarich" (1937), again with Boyer; "Bluebeard's Eighth Wife" (1938), with Gary Cooper; "Zaza" (1939), with Herbert Marshall; "Midnight" (1939), with Don Ameche; "It's a Wonderful World" (1939), with James Stewart; and "Drums Along the Mohawk" (1939), with Henry Fonda. 

In addition to Capra and DeMille, Colbert was working with the top directors in the industry: Dorothy Arzner, Ernst Lubitsch, Preston Sturges, Frank Lloyd, John M. Stahl, Wesley Ruggles, Gregory La Cava, Anatole Litvak, George Cukor, Mitchell Leisen, and John Ford.

Colbert was a stickler for perfection regarding the way she appeared on screen. She believed that her face was difficult to light and photograph, and was obsessed with not showing her "bad" side, the right, to the camera, because of a small bump that resulted from a childhood broken nose.

From 1936 to 1944, she starred in numerous programs of Cecil B. DeMille's "Lux Radio Theater", which was one of the most popular dramatic radio shows at the time. In 1952, she returned to work in her native France where she stayed until 1955.

Apart from making two more Hollywood films, she went back to Broadway in 1958 doing "The Marriage Go-Round" with Charles Boyer, earning a 1959 Tony Award nomination for her work. Also for her Chicago theatre work, in 1980 she won the Sarah Siddons Award. In 1984 she appeared with Rex Harrison in Frederick Lonsdale's "Aren't We All" at the Haymarket Theatre, London, and also the Brooks Atkinson Theatre on Broadway, presented by Douglas Urbanski. Ms. Colbert's last film was "Parrish" in 1961. She acted in numerous Broadway plays for the next twenty years. In 1987, she did a television mini-series titled "The Two Mrs. Grenvilles" and was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Mini-series or a Special. In 1988, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture made for TV. In 1989 she received the Kennedy Center Honors.

During her long and successful career, Claudette Colbert played in sixty-five films. For her contribution to the motion picture industry, she was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6812 Hollywood Blvd.

Colbert married twice. Her first husband was Norman Foster, an actor and later a director, whom she married in 1928 and divorced in Mexico in 1935. According to the account of the divorce in the "New York Times", published on 31 August 1935, "Some secrecy surrounded the proceedings, for while Mr. Feldman [Colbert's agent] apparently was at liberty to tell of the divorce being granted, he said he could not tell where in Mexico it was obtained." The report further stated that "The Fosters created something of a sensation when they disclosed that they were trying to remain happily married while living in separate homes. But even this experiment apparently failed." Four months after her divorce, on 24 December 1935, Colbert married Dr. Joel J. Pressman, a throat specialist, who died in 1968; her former husband went on to marry the actress Sally Blane, a sister of Loretta Young.

When she retired from motion pictures, Colbert and her husband moved to Palm Springs where she operated a store for a time before moving to Barbados. The idea of moving to Barbados came to her following a visit to Noel Coward's house in Jamaica. At her home there, called Bellerive, she spent her later years as a hostess to the world's powerful and famous. Ronald Reagan was one of her guests during his presidency, as were Lillian Helman, Kirk Douglas, Jack Benny, Rex Harrison, and Slim Keith. She had a small guest house built on the property for the honeymoon of Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow. 

Colbert died at her home in Barbados, following series of small strokes during the last two years of her life at the age of 92, and she was interred there in the Parish of St. Peter Cemetery along with her mother and husband. A requiem mass was held at St. Vincent Ferrer church in New York City later.

According to an article published in the 10 August 1996 issue of the "Cincinnati Post", the childless Colbert left most of her estate, estimated at $3.5 million and including her Manhattan apartment and her home in Barbados, to a friend, Helen O'Hagan (1931—), a retired director of corporate relations at Saks Fifth Avenue, whom Colbert had met in 1961 on the set of "Parrish", the actress's last film.Bellerive was later bought by David Geffen.

After Colbert's death, rumors about the actress's purported lesbian relationships, including supposed affairs with Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo, began to circulate in the international media. In response, Colbert's friend Helen O'Hagan told the "New York Daily News" that the actress barely knew Dietrich or Garbo and that Colbert was "a man's lady". The purported Colbert-Dietrich relationship also was explored in the 2001 book "Behind the Screen: How Gays and Lesbians Shaped Hollywood, 1910-1969" by William J. Mann, a film historian.

Doctor (Doctor Who)

The Doctor is the central character in the long-running BBC science fiction television series "Doctor Who". 

He is an alien, a "Time Lord" from the planet Gallifrey. The Doctor travels in his space-time-ship, the TARDIS, with which he can go anywhere in time and space. Because the TARDIS' "chameleon circuit" is broken, it looks like an old British police-box permanently. The Doctor often takes other people with him, who are usually called "companions" or "assistants". They are most often human; the most recent companion is Amy Pond. 

The Doctor did not want to stay on Gallifrey any longer, so he "borrowed" an old Type 40 TARDIS. In the TARDIS he and his granddaughter Susan Foreman left their home planet Gallifrey. They stayed for a time on Earth in the 1960s, where Susan also went to school. Her teachers, Barbara Wright and Ian Chesterton, discovered the TARDIS. They traveled for a while with the Doctor, and returned to Earth two years later. After them the Doctor often took other people with him on his travels.

As a Gallifreyan the Doctor looks like a human on the surface, but there are differences. One well-known difference is that he has two hearts. As a Time Lord the Doctor can also "regenerate", if his body is badly hurt and he dies. During the "regeneration", the body is healed and renewed, which includes a different appearance and personality. The regenerated person is the same person, with the same memories and basic personality traits; but the person also looks different and a changed personality. Because of this the Doctor could be played by different actors. This made it possible for the series to be filmed over a time of nearly fifty years without having to actually "change" the character.

Up until now, the Doctor has regenerated ten times, and each "incarnation" was played by a different actor.

The Doctor has been played by other actors in other media, in theatre plays, parodies, etc. But these are not officially part of the "Doctor Who" storyline. Notable among them are:

WWE Raw

WWE RAW, is the Monday night professional wrestling television program for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and is the main broadcast of the Raw brand. "WWE Raw" is usually seen as WWE's flagship program over its sister programs, "SmackDown!" and "NXT", due to its longer history and the way it is promoted.

Starting as "WWF Monday Night Raw", the program first started on January 11, 1993 on the USA Network for one hour. The original "Raw" broke new ground in televised professional wrestling. Traditionally, wrestling shows were taped on sound stages with small viewers or at big arena shows. The "Raw" formula was very different than that of its predecessor, "Prime Time Wrestling". Instead of taped matches, with studio voice overs and taped chat, "Raw" was a show shot to a live viewers, with angles as they happened. The first episode had Yokozuna winning against Koko B. Ware, The Steiner Brothers winning against The Executioners, WWF Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels winning against Max Moon and The Undertaker winning against Damien Demento. The show also featured an interview with Razor Ramon.

"Raw" came from the Grand Ballroom at Manhattan Center Studios, a small New York City theater and played live each week. The combination of an intimate venue and live action proved highly successful. However, the weekly live schedule proved to be a financial drain on the WWF, and taped shows began airing every other week. From early 1994 to September 1999, "Raw" was shown live on one Monday and then the next day (Tuesday) next Monday's "Raw" was taped. This meant that "Raw" was live one week and taped the next. 

The storylines and characters during the early years of "Raw" still had a healthy dose of the old Federation "gimmick-heavy" style. For example, there were moments such as Irwin R. Schyster tearing up Tatanka's headdress, the different "Undertaker sightings" (during the Undertaker vs. Undertaker storyline, leading up to SummerSlam 1994); and characters like Duke "The Dumpster" Droese, Doink the Clown, or Thurman "Sparky" Plugg.

"Raw" was also one of a kind, in which they covered the unexpected, exciting moments, a prelude to the "Attitude Era", in which it coined "Raw" as "Uncut, Uncensored, Uncooked." Some of those moments are Razor Ramon losing a match unexpectedly to Sean "The 1-2-3 Kid" Waltman, who was later known as X-Pac, Marty Jannetty beating Shawn Michaels to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship, and "Raw" was the first WWF television program of any kind to show footage of Lex Luger bodyslamming Yokozuna at the "USS Intrepid".

The first hosts of "Raw" were Vince McMahon, Rob Bartlett and "Macho Man" Randy Savage. Sean Mooney conducted the interviews and Bobby "The Brain" Heenan also helped contribute. In March 1993, Rob Bartlett was dropped from the broadcasting team and was replaced by Bobby Heenan. Then on December 6, 1993, Gorilla Monsoon kicked Bobby Heenan out of the WWF forever. In reality, this was a storyline between Monsoon and his close friend Heenan, who decided to leave the World Wrestling Federation in order to lighten his travel schedule and because he did not want to take a 50% paycut. After about a year, "Raw" moved out of the Manhattan Center and traveled to various regular Federation venues in the United States.

In 1995, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) began showing its new wrestling show, "Monday Nitro", live each week on TNT. "Raw" and "Nitro" went head-to-head for the first time on September 11 1995. Due to "Raw"'s taping schedule on several occasions, WCW Vice President Eric Bischoff, who was also an on-air personality, would often give away the results of WWF's taped "Raw" shows on the live WCW show. Some fans also looked at "Raw" taping results on the steadily-growing Internet; as a result, this caused the ratings of the taped "Raw" episodes to be lower.

"WWF Raw" had a live broadcast every other week to save costs, until September 1999, when ratings and pay-per-view buy rate grown, allowing them to justify doing a weekly live show.

At the start of the ratings war in 1995 through to mid-1996, "Raw" and "Nitro" exchanged victories over each over in a closely contested rivalry. Beginning in mid-1996, however, thanks primarily to the nWo angle, "Monday Nitro" started a ratings win-streak that lasted for eighty-three continuous weeks, ending on April 13 1998.

On February 3, 1997, "Monday Night Raw" went to a two hour format, as the Attitude Era was starting to come in full stream in the WWF. In an attempt to break the momentum of what had turned into ratings domination by WCW's competing "Monday Nitro", Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) was brought in as Jerry Lawler "challenged" ECW on February 17, 1997. In an episode where "Raw" returned to the Manhattan Center, the "challenge" answered on the following week's show with Taz, Mikey Whipwreck, Sabu, Tommy Dreamer, D-Von Dudley, and the Sandman. ECW owner Paul Heyman did a call-in interview on "Raw" the week after that.

During 1997, there were more and more controversial elements in "Raw" and WWF programming such as the Nation of Domination, and the D-Generation X "racial graffiti" storyline designed to "implicate Bret Hart's 'the Hart Foundation'", and the "XXX Files" series.

On March 10, 1997, "Monday Night Raw" officially became "Raw is War". The March 17, 1997 episode featured a heated Bret Hart/Vince McMahon ringside altercation (that unknowingly foreshadowed events in November) with profanity normally unheard on TV. Brian Pillman did a series of "XXX Files" segments with Terri Runnels, which further "pushed the envelope". These segments ended prematurely with the September 29, 1997 episode of "Raw", after the death of Pillman on October 5, 1997 due to hereditary heart problems.

After WrestleMania XIV in March 1998, the WWF regained the lead in the Monday Night Wars with its new "WWF Attitude" brand, led in particular by rising stars Steve Austin, The Rock and Mankind. The classic feud between the villainous WWF Chairman Vince McMahon (who was re-imagined and re-branded from the color commentator into the evil company chairman character Mr. McMahon after the real-life Montreal Screwjob incident) and fan favorite Steve Austin (who had been released by Bischoff in the summer of 1995 for not being marketable) caught the imaginations of fans. The April 13, 1998 episode of "Raw", headlined by a match between Austin and McMahon, marked the first time that WCW had lost the head-to-head Monday night ratings battle in the 84 weeks since 1996.

While "Raw" was taking a new approach to programming, "Nitro" would start making lackluster shows with the same storylines. Older stars such as Hogan and Nash frequented the main events, while younger talent such as Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero were not given opportunities to advance, and the only newcomer elevated to main-event status at this time was Bill Goldberg.

Meanwhile, on "Raw", fans were immersed in the feud between WWF owner Vince McMahon and "Stone Cold" Steve Austin. New talent such as Triple H and his D-Generation X faction, Mankind and The Rock were elevated to main event status on the WWF's program. Superstars such as Kane, Val Venis, Goldust, etc. were coming through the ranks and exposing the WWF as the place where new talent comes through unlike the WCW counterpart. Things were so heated between the two programs that, when both shows were in the same area on the same night ("Raw" in Hampton, Virginia, "Nitro" in Norfolk), D-X was sent to film a "war" segment at the Norfolk Scope where they berated WCW and interviewed fans on camera who stated that they received their "Nitro" tickets for free (presumably in an attempt by WCW to pack the arena as full as possible due to low ticket sales).

On January 4, 1999. Mick Foley, who had wrestled for WCW in the early 1990s as Cactus Jack, won the WWF Title as Mankind on "Raw". On orders from Bischoff, "Nitro" announcer Tony Schiavone gave away this previously taped result on the live "Nitro", and then sarcastically added ""that'll sure put some butts in the seats""; over 600,000 viewers changed channels to watch "Raw". This was also the night that "Nitro" aired a WCW World Championship match in which Kevin Nash blatantly laid down for Hulk Hogan after Hogan poked him in the chest. The next week, and for months after, many fans in the "Raw" audience brought signs which read, ""Mick Foley put my ass in this seat!""

A new television contract with Viacom led to a WWF change in the broadcast. On September 25 2000, "Raw" moved from the USA Network to TNN (which later became Spike TV).

WCW's sharp decrease in revenue and ratings led to Time Warner's sale of the company to the WWF in 2001. The last version of "Nitro" was shown on March 26 2001. The show began with Vince McMahon making a short statement about his recent purchase of WCW and ended with a simulcast on "Raw" on TNN with an appearance by Vince's son Shane McMahon on "Nitro". Shane interrupted his father's gloating over the WCW purchase to explain that Shane was the one who actually owned WCW, setting up what become the WWF's "Invasion" storyline.

The "Raw is War" logo and name were retired in September 2001, following the September 11, 2001 attacks and sensitivity over the word "war". It also symbolized that professional wrestling's "Monday Night Wars" were over.

In early to mid-2002, WWE had a process they called the "Brand Extension". WWE divided itself into two "de facto" wrestling promotions with separate rosters, storylines and authority figures. Raw and SmackDown! would host each division, give its name to the division and essentially compete against each other. The split was a result of WWF purchasing their two biggest competitors, WCW and ECW. The brand extension was publicly announced during a telecast of "WWF Raw" on March 25 2002, and became official the next day.

Wrestlers now would become show-exclusive, wrestling for their specific show only. At the time this excluded the WWE Undisputed Championship and WWE Women's Championship, as those WWE titles would be defended on both shows. In August 2002, WWE Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar did not want to defend the title on "Raw", in effect causing his title to become exclusive to "SmackDown!" The following week on Raw, General Manager Eric Bischoff awarded a newly instated World Heavyweight Championship to Raw's designated #1 contender, Triple H. Due to the fact that since the WWE Undisputed Championship was now SmackDown! exclusive it was no longer seen as "undisputed". Following this, the WWE Women's Championship soon became Raw-exclusive as well. As a result of the Brand Extension, an annual "draft lottery" was instituted to exchange members of each roster and generally refresh the lineups. 

"WWE Raw" said they have earned the distinction of having the most original episodes of any fictional weekly program on August 2, 2005 when it broadcast the 636th episode. It was said to have took the place of "Gunsmoke", which held that distinction. However, under the criteria WWE used to make this claim, the actual record would be held by the show "Georgia Championship Wrestling", which ran continuously on Saturday evenings on TBS between 1972 and 1984.

On March 10 2005, Viacom and WWE decided not to go on with the agreement with Spike TV, making it so "Raw" and other WWE programs on the network would cease when their deal expired in September 2005. On April 4 2005, WWE announced a 3-year deal with NBC Universal to bring "Raw" back to its old home, the USA Network, with 2 yearly specials on NBC and a Spanish "Raw" on Telemundo. On the same week as "Raw"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s restart on USA, Spike TV scheduled Ultimate Fighting Championship's live "Ultimate Fight Night" in "Raw"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s old timeslot in a try to go head-to-head with "Raw".

The show's first night back on USA was billed as the "WWE Homecoming" and featured the return of former WWE Champions such as Hulk Hogan, Steve Austin, Mick Foley, Triple H and Vince McMahon along with cameos from legends such as Roddy Piper, Jimmy Hart, Jimmy Snuka and Harley Race. WWE Homecoming was three hours long — the longest an episode of "Raw" has ever run in its 12-year history. USA also showed "Raw Exposed", an hour of the best moments of "Raw" during its previous run on USA. WWE announced that "Raw" got its highest ratings in three years, gaining close to six million viewers.

The following week, Vince McMahon fired Jim Ross for not helping after Steve Austin gave him and his entire family the Stone Cold Stunner. Jonathan Coachman, the second analyst at the table, took over Ross's duties as play-by-play for two weeks until former ECW announcer Joey Styles was hired.

On the May 1, 2006 version of "Raw", Joey Styles said he was quitting (kayfabe). His vacating of the announcer position set the stage for Jim Ross to return to Raw's commentary booth, thus ending the storyline where Ross got fired by Linda McMahon. This freed Styles to become a commentator for the ECW brand when it launched in June.

In Canada, after an 11 year run on TSN, "Raw" moved to rival sports broadcaster The Score after it was announced that TSN would be carrying "Monday Night Football"' for the 2006 season. This also meant that Canadian viewers would be watching via tape-delay, as The Score did not broadcast "Raw" live at first, but in 2007, started airing the show live.

During the September 25, 2006 episode of "Raw" in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the opening of "Raw" suffered a blackout. Spotlights were the only lights running in the house. Power in the presentation was later back. Another similar moment happened back on May 26 1996 in Florence, South Carolina for WWF , when a major thunderstorm hit the Florence Civic Center causing major chaos for the PPV. That Tuesday, , returned to North Charleston, South Carolina to finish out three matches that were not shown because of the lost power feed.

On October 9, 2006, "Raw" held a three hour season start called the "Raw Family Reunion", where the Raw brand had a new logo and theme song, Papa Roach's ""...To Be Loved"". The episode also featured talent from the SmackDown! and ECW brands. Later that month, on October 23 "Raw" aired its 700th episode, making it the longest running weekly entertainment show, without a hiatus, in television history.

On June 25, 2007, "Raw" was scheduled in Corpus Christi, Texas to be a three-hour special memorial show for the (kayfabe) death of the Mr. McMahon character after he had been presumed dead in a limo explosion. The event was canceled due to the real death of Chris Benoit and his family earlier that day, with a three-hour Chris Benoit memorial show being shown instead. This was the first time that "Raw" had been shown with no viewers and had Vince McMahon breaking kayfabe to address the viewers at home. The show had extracts from the DVD , showing some of Benoit's most memorable matches, along with comments from some of Benoit's colleagues. However, when the facts of Benoit's death came to light, WWE pulled this episode from international markets which aired "Raw" on a tape delay basis. Several channels announced the episode was being withheld for legal reasons. A substitute "Raw", hosted by Todd Grisham from WWE Studios, was created featuring recaps of big-time championship changes of the past year. The episode started with a message from Vince McMahon which originally aired on the June 26 edition of "ECW".

On December 10 2007 "Raw" celebrated its 15th anniversary in a three-hour spectacular on the USA Network with the returns of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Rob Van Dam, The Godfather, Steve Blackman, Howard Finkel, Ted DiBiase, Eric Bischoff, Marty Jannetty, Gangrel, Trish Stratus, Lita, Sunny, Hulk Hogan and Mick Foley (as Mankind) among others. Along with several reunions of former tag teams and also included a 15-man "15 Years of Raw" battle royal. The RAW XV: 15th Anniversary DVD was also sold that had the best moments in Raw history.

In April 2008 as part of the United States presidential election, candidates Barack Obama, John McCain and Hillary Rodham Clinton presented special messages on W.W.E. Raw. The show was watched by an estimated 4.97 million viewers, of which there were 1.45 million viewers who were men aged 18 to 34: an important group of voters the candidates were trying to talk to.

In 2009, at No Way Out that February 15, Edge won the World Heavyweight Championship in Raw's Elimination Chamber match, thus making it a SmackDown exclusive title and giving SmackDown two top tier championships. As a result of the 2009 WWE Draft in April, WWE Champion Triple H was drafted to the Raw brand, while the World Heavyweight Championship moved to the Raw brand after Edge lost the title to John Cena at WrestleMania XXV. SmackDown would regain the World Heavyweight Championship at Backlash (2009) when Edge defeated John Cena to win the championship. In addition, SmackDown and Raw would exchange both women-exclusive championships with Raw gaining the WWE Divas Championship and SmackDown gaining the WWE Women's Championship. Also, SmackDown and Raw exchanged the WWE Intercontinental Championship which is now exclusive to SmackDown and the WWE United States Championship which is exclusive to Raw Brand, for the first time ever.

On June 15, 2009, McMahon announced on a special three-hour edition of Raw that he had "sold" the WWE Raw franchise to Donald Trump, who appeared on-screen to confirm it and declared he would be at the following commercial-free episode in person. WWE issued a press release on the scripted sale while the USA Network later issued a statement confirming the "sale" as part of a storyline. The statement was issued in response to multiple news sources having mistakenly reported the event as legitimate. Due to the mistake, on the day following the announcement, WWE's stock on the New York Stock Exchange notably fell. Despite USA Network's acknowledgment that the sale was fictional, Randy Katz, a securities lawyer with Baker & Hostetler, commented on the Fox Business Network that a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against WWE and USA Network owner General Electric "certainly is a possibility. The next week, Vince McMahon repurchased Raw from Donald Trump and announced that a "Guest host" initiative originally introduced by Trump in response to the position of General Manager being vacant would go in effect on June 29. Each weekly guest host is usually either a WWE Hall of Famer, a former or returning talent, or other celebrity. The guest host or hostess assumes the role of a brand General Manager, serving as Raw's authority figure for the day. The following year, it was announced that with Vickie Guerrero (and subsequently Bret Hart) becoming the new full time GM, the guest hosts (while continuing to appear) would no longer have booking power.

In 2010, TNA IMPACT!, which normally airs on Thursdays, would go head to head with Raw in a three-hour live broadcast. This would be the first time since March 2001 that two major wrestling promotions would go head-to-head in a Monday night ratings competition. TNA promoted the debut of Hulk Hogan leading to the broadcast. WWE countered by announcing the return of Bret Hart, who had not appeared with the company since the Montreal Screwjob in 1997. The ratings showed that, much like the first Monday Night War, Raw came out on top, averaging 5.6 million viewers while iMPACT! averaged 2.2 million viewers.[25]

On March 8, 2010, Impact! permanently moved to Monday nights to compete head-to-head with Raw. After declining ratings, Spike executives announced that starting April 5, Impact! would air an hour earlier than Raw. After scoring its lowest ever rating at 0.5, it was announced May 3 that Impact! would be moving back to its original time on Thursdays starting May 13.[28] Since then on April 19, 2010, many of the WWE Raw superstars were stranded in Belfast due to the ash cloud from Eyjafjallajökull (a volcano in Iceland) hovering over most of Europe and causing many flights to be put on hold. Former ring announcer Lilian Garcia announced that night while the SmackDown roster took part in production of the Raw episode. The following month on May 17, 2010, Raw aired its second overall commercial free episode from the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario.

That summer on August 30, 2010, Raw aired its 900th episode, SmackDown superstars and NXT rookies also appeared on this milestone episode. It featured The Undertaker vs Bret Hart for the first time in almost 14 years. That November, Raw went "Old School" for one night with the old ring and titantron designs. This episode featured WWE Legends Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Mae Young, Million Dollar Man, Ron Simmons, The Iron Sheik and many more. Mark Henry briefly returned to his "Sexual Chocolate" gimmick in honor of Raw going "Old School".

As of 2008, "Raw" is shown live on Monday evenings on the USA Network (in the USA), The Score in Canada and on Sky Sports 3 in Great Britain, though it is sometimes taped and placed on a broadcast delay depending on what circumstances dictate. The theme song for the Raw brand is ""Burn It To The Ground"" by Nickelback since November 16, 2009. Before that the theme song was ""...To Be Loved"" by Papa Roach, which used from October 9, 2006 to November 9, 2009.

Since March 10 1997, broadcasts of "Raw" were split into two hours and given hourly names for television ratings purposes, with the first hour being referred to as "Raw is War" and the second as "War Zone" by the show's on-screen graphics. However, as of October 1 2001, the first hour has been referred to as "Raw" and the second as "Raw Zone" by the show's on-screen graphics.

On January 7 2008, WWE said that all 3 brands (RAW, SmackDown!, and ECW) would be broadcast in HD, codenamed "WWE HD" starting with RAW on January 21. WWE invested about $20 million dollars on new recording and broadcasting equipment to prepare for the move, as well as new pyrotechnics and lighting. The move replaced the RAW, SmackDown!, and ECW sets with a new state of the art set shared by all brands.

The show currently starts live on USA Network (and on tape delay Wednesdays on mun2, and Sundays on Telemundo (in Spanish)) in the United States, and in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland on Sky Sports 3. It also currently broadcasts on tape delay in Canada on The Score and Global Quebec, in Australia on FOX8, in Portugal on SIC Radical,in Italy on Sky Italia in Finland on MTV3 MAX, in Malaysia on Astro Super Sport, in New Zealand on The Box, in Greece on Supersport 3, in India and Pakistan on Ten Sports, in the Philippines on Jack TV and Solar TV, in Chile on Chilevisión, in Mexico on 52MX, in Bulgaria on GTV, in Panama on RPC Canal 4, in Peru on ATV, in Saudi Arabia and Middle east on ART SPORT, in Romania on TV Sport, in Serbia on FOX Televizija, in South Korea on XTM, in Spain on Cuatro TV, in France on NT1 and RTL9, in Brazil on SBT, in Argentina on Canal 9 (Argentina) and on AFN Xtra.

Doctor Who companions

The companions or assistants of the Doctor of the "Doctor Who" television series. 

The Doctor is an alien, a "Time Lord" from the planet Gallifrey. He travels in his space-time-ship TARDIS, with which he can go anywhere in time and space. The Doctor usually takes other people with him, who are usually called "companions" or "assistants". The Doctor and his companions travel through space and time, have a lot of adventures, and often save many people. 

The character of the companion was there so that the people watching the series could identify and feel close to a character. The companions were often present-time humans, so people could feel close to them, and they knew as much as the viewers. Because of this, the Doctor could explain things to his companions, and at the same time to the viewers. 

Almost all the Doctor's companions have been human, or human-looking aliens. Two companions were robots.

Companions are named under the Doctors they travelled with, and sorted by first appearance.

Because Susan seems very strange, Barbara and Ian follow the "unearthly child" home to the TARDIS, where they meet the Doctor. With him they begin to travel through space and time. 

In "The Chase", after two years of travelling with the Doctor, Barbara and Ian use a Dalek time machine to return to London.

Ludwig Wittgenstein

Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein ( in German) (April 26, 1889 – April 29, 1951) was an Austrian philosopher. He worked mainly in the basics of logic, the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language. He is regarded as one of the most important philosophers of the twentieth century. 

Before his death at the age of 62, the only book Wittgenstein had published was the "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus". His second book "Philosophical Investigations" was published shortly after he died. Both of these works are regarded as very important for analytic philosophy.

Ludwig Wittgenstein was born in Vienna on April 26, 1889, to Karl and Leopoldine Wittgenstein. He was the youngest of eight children and was born into one of the most prominent and wealthy families in the Austro-Hungarian empire. His father's parents, Hermann Christian and Fanny Wittgenstein, were born into Jewish families but later converted to Protestantism, and after they moved from Saxony to Vienna in the 1850s, assimilated themselves into the Viennese Protestant professional classes. Ludwig's father, Karl Wittgenstein, became an industrialist and went on to make a fortune in iron and steel. Ludwig's mother Leopoldine, born Kalmus, was an aunt of the Nobel Prize laureate Friedrich von Hayek. Despite Karl's Protestantism, and the fact that Leopoldine's father was Jewish, the Wittgenstein children were baptized as Roman Catholics — the faith of their maternal grandmother — and Ludwig was given a Roman Catholic burial upon his death.

Wittgenstein began studying mechanical engineering. During his research he became interested in the foundations of mathematics, particularly after reading Bertrand Russell's "Principles of Mathematics" and Gottlob Frege's "Grundgesetze". In 1911 Wittgenstein visited Frege and Russell and discussed philosophy with them at great length. He made a great impression on Russell and started to work on the foundations of logic and mathematical logic. Russell saw Wittgenstein as a successor who would carry on his work. 

During the First World War Wittgenstein served in the army and developed his logic. He included ethical aspects. In the summer of 1918 he learned that his friend David Pinsent had been killed in an airplane accident. Wittgenstein became depressed and thought of suicide. He went to stay with his uncle Paul where he was able to complete the "Tractatus". No publisher accepted it, but Russell realised it was a philosophically important work and wrote an introduction. Wittgenstein did not like it because he thought that Russel had not understood the book. In the end Wilhelm Ostwald's journal "Annalen der Naturphilosophie" printed a German edition in 1921, and Routledge's Kegan Paul printed a bilingual edition with Russell's introduction in 1922.

Since Wittgenstein thought that the "Tractatus" had solved all the problems of philosophy, he left philosophy and returned to Austria to train as a primary school teacher. Wittgenstein had unrealistic expectations of the rural children he taught, and had little patience with those children who had no gift for mathematics. But he had good results with children that were interested, especially boys. His severe disciplinary methods led to disagreement with some of his students' parents, and eventually he resigned his position and returned to Vienna, feeling that he had failed as a school teacher.

After abandoning his work as a school teacher, Wittgenstein worked as a gardener's assistant in a monastery near Vienna and then he worked with the architect, Paul Engelmann. This intellectual work did much to restore Wittgenstein's spirits.

Toward the end of this work, Wittgenstein was contacted by Moritz Schlick, one of the leading figures of the newly formed Vienna Circle. This contact stimulated Wittgenstein intellectually and revived his interest in philosophy. 

In 1929 he decided to return to Cambridge. He was met at the railway station by a crowd of England's greatest intellectuals. He found out to his horror that he was one of the most famous philosophers in the world now.
In 1939 Wittgenstein was appointed to the chair in Philosophy at Cambridge. 

During World War II he left Cambridge and volunteered as a hospital porter in Guy's Hospital in London and as a laboratory assistant in Newcastle upon Tyne's Royal Victoria Infirmary. 

Wittgenstein resigned his position at Cambridge in 1947 to concentrate on his writing. When in 1949 one found out that he had prostate cancer, he had written most of the material that would be published after his death from the disease as "Philosophische Untersuchungen" ("Philosophical Investigations"), which might be his most important work.

<doc id="98012" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=98012" title="Tsing Hua University">
Tsing Hua University

Tsing Hua University or THU (simplified Chinese: 清华大学; traditional Chinese: 清華大學; pinyin: Qīng Huá Dà Xué), is a university in Beijing, People's Republic of China. It is regarded as one of the best and most selective universities in China. It was established in 1911 as a school for Chinese graduates wanting to go further with their studies at universities in other countries, especially America and the UK.

Tsing Hua University was opened in Beijing, China in 1911 on the site of a former royal garden belonging to a prince. It was first a "preparatory school", a school for preparation, for students to be later sent by the government to study in America. The people who graduated were transferred directly to American schools as juniors upon graduation.

In 1925, the school established its College Department and started its research institute on Chinese Study. In 1928, the name officially changed to National Tsing Hua University (NTHU).

During the Second World War in 1937, Tsing Hua University, along with Peking University and Nankai University, merged to form Chang Sha Temporary University in Chang Sha, which later became National Southwestern Associated University in Kunming of Yunnan province. After the war, Tsing Hua moved back to Beijing and resumed its operation.

The communist victory at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 led to the creation of the People's Republic of China (PRC), so the university's President Mei Yi Qi and some professors went to Taiwan where they established the National Tsing Hua Institute of Nuclear Technology in 1955, which later became National Tsing Hua University.
In 1952, the communist government regrouped the country's higher education institutions in an attempt to build a Soviet style system, with individual institutions tending to specialise in a certain field of study. TsingHua University was disassembled, losing its law school, school of agriculture, school of sciences and humanities, and became a polytechnic engineering university. Even so, the University remained in the top tier schools in China (Many Chinese scholars regards that its only rival is Peking University). In many years following this regroup, the school was often referred to as the "MIT of China". But since the 1980s, the university began to incorporate a multidisciplinary system. As a result, a lot of schools were built and rebuilt. These included the School of Science, School of Economics and Management, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, School of Law, School of Public Administration, and the School of Art. Only two colleges charge tuition to its graduate students; the law school and the Academy of Arts and Design.

During the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, the university became a battlefield between different sects of Mao's Red Guards (China) and a stronghold of the radicals. It did not resume its normal operation until 1977 when the Cultural Revolution was officially put to an end. 

Since 1977, the university has enjoyed rich government funding and policy support which greatly improved its facilities. Since 1978, it has flourished with the re-establishment of the departments in sciences, economics and management, and the humanities. Its graduate school has been recognized nationally, ranking first in the National Evaluation of Graduate Schools. The School of Continuing Education makes the best use of modern information technologies, as well as the advanced educational resources at Tsing Hua.

Most Chinese university rankings place TsingHua first in China. It attracts the most talented students of the nation and enjoys the best engineering and applied sciences programs in China, occupying a position similar to MIT, Stanford, and Princeton in the US. Peking Union Medical College of Tsinghua University is likewise regarded as the best medical school in the country. Tsinghua's longtime rival Peking University is better known for natural sciences, social sciences, law, and liberal arts, somewhat similar to the Ivy League schools of Yale, Harvard, and the University of Pennsylvania.

Admission to Tsinghua is highly competitive. The majority of selected students are national scholars and among the brightest high school graduates in the country. Many of China's top scientists, engineers, politicians and business leaders are among Tsinghua alumni. The current Chinese president, Hu Jintao, is a former Tsinghua student who graduated with a degree in hydraulic engineering in 1964. 

There are voices of criticism that nowadays, the university's top graduates are more likely to enroll at prestigious US university and research institutions.

As of 2003, Tsinghua University had 12 colleges and 48 departments, 41 research institutes, 35 research centers, and 167 laboratories, including 15 national key laboratories. In September 2006, Peking Union Medical College was renamed to Peking Union Medical College, Tsinghua University . The university offers 51 bachelor's degree programs, 139 master's degree programs and 107 Ph.D. programs. Recently, Tsinghua has become the first Chinese university to offer a Master of Laws program in American law, through a cooperative venture with the Temple University Beasley School of Law. The university is a member of LAOTSE, an international network of leading universities in Europe and Asia. Each year, the University celebrates the Intellectual Property Summer Institute in cooperation with Franklin Pierce Law Center of Concord, New Hampshire.

On April 12, 2007, Tsinghua University's School of Economics and Management became the first business school in the Chinese mainland to earn AACSB accreditation. Former Premier Zhu Rongji was the founding dean of the school. 

The University's Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology is on a separate campus in a northern suburb of Beijing.

Tsinghua is the Chinese university where former United States Vice President Al Gore lectured at in his documentary, An Inconvenient Truth. Viewers can see the university lecture hall, with its well-known purple seats.

The campus of Tsinghua University is located in northwest Beijing, in the Haidian district which was designated for universities.

It is located on the former site of Qing Dynasty royal gardens and retains some Chinese-style landscaping as well as some traditional buildings, but many of its buildings are Western-style reflecting the American influence in its history. It is known throughout China for having one of the most beautiful campuses.

The university's architect T. Chuang, a 1914 graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, modeled his designs for the quadrangle and auditorium of Tsinghua on the Illinois campus, specifically imitating Foellinger Auditorium, located on the quad at the University of Illinois.

Tsinghua's early alma mater (school anthem) was composed by an American instructor Miss Katherine E. Seelye:

Tsing Hua College Song

In 1923, another version of the school alma mater with lyrics in Chinese (by Prof. Wang Luan Xiang, a Chinese language professor of Tsinghua) was composed by Mrs. Zhang Hui Zhen and was well received by the students and faculty. The song was then adopted as the school's official Alma Mater.

The last Sunday of April is Tsinghua's anniversary and Homecoming ("Xiao-Qing") Day.

Redbud and Lilac

Purple and White

The school cheer goes: Ri-ri-ri, Rah-rah-rah! Tsinghua, Tsinghua, Tsinghua ! Rah-rah-rah!

Tsinghua University has signed agreements with ACCA (Association of Chartered Certified Accountants), the renowned international accountancy body that offers Chartered Certified Accountant qualification worldwide, to train the new generation of professional accountants in China. Under the agreement, Tsinghua will develop the programme that under ACCA's syllabus for enabling China's young accounting students to join the ACCA professional exam scheme at a higher level. Tsinghua will also recognise the Oxford Brookes University BSc Applied Accounting degree, which has been successfully developed in conjunction with ACCA and which enables students who have completed two parts of the ACCA qualification to apply for the Oxford Brookes degree.(Please click: )

Cave painting

Cave paintings are paintings on cave walls and ceilings. Usually these paintings were made in Prehistoric times. Most cave paintings date from 10.000 to 20.000 years ago. The oldest are from about 32.000 years ago, but scientists still disagree if this dating is correct.

It is not known why these paintings were made. Most people think they may have had a function for rituals. They may also have been a way to transit information; to tell other people about something. Most paintings are in caves that are difficult to access. These caves usually also do not show signs that people lived there all year round. 

Today, there are about 350 caves known which have paintings in them. A great number is located in France and Spain. The best known are probably the caves of Altamira (in Spain), Lascaux (in France), or Creswell Crags in England. Sometimes, paintings were also done on cliff faces. Fewer of those have survived though, because of erosion. One such example are the rock paintings of Astuvansalmi (in Finland).

Most often, animals or hunting scenes were painted. Sometimes hands are there too. Rarely, there are also more abstract patterns; these are usually called finger fluntings.

The paintings were drawn with red and yellow ochre, hematite, manganese oxide and charcoal. Sometimes the silhouette of the animal was put into the rock first.

<doc id="98043" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=98043" title="Radiocarbon dating">
Radiocarbon dating

Radiocarbon dating, also known as the C–14 method, is a way of telling how old something is. It is a type of radiometric dating. The method uses the radioactive isotope carbon-14. Most organic matter contains carbon. Carbon has different isotopes, which are usually not radioactive; C is the radioactive one, its half-life, or time it takes to radioactively decay to one half its original amount, is about 5,730 years. This makes it possible to tell the age of substances that contain carbon. The method works to about 60,000 years old. Dates obtained are usually written as "before present" ('present' is 1950). 

Plants take up atmospheric carbon dioxide by photosynthesis, and are ingested by animals, so every living thing is constantly exchanging carbon-14 with its environment as long as it lives. Once it dies, however, this exchange stops.

In 1958 Hessel de Vries showed that the concentration of carbon-14 in the atmosphere varies with time and locality. The relatively short-lived C is constantly renewed by cosmic ray bombardment on atmospheric nitrogen. Since the bombardment is slightly variable, and for other reasons, the C taken into organic matter is also slightly variable. That leads to slight errors in the chronology. However, under about 20,000 years the results can be compared with dendrochronology, based on tree rings. For the most accurate work, variations are compensated by means of calibration curves. 

The method was developed by Willard Libby and his colleagues at the University of Chicago in 1949. In 1960, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work. He first demonstrated the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by accurately estimating the age of wood from an ancient Egyptian royal barge of which the age was known from historical documents.

Hallstatt culture

The Hallstatt era is named after the city Hallstatt in Austria, where the first artifacts were found. It lasted from about 1200 BC to about 275 BC. There were different periods, which today are mainly told apart by the kinds of brooches used. These brooches changed rather rapidly, and permit a good estimate. Hallstatt culture sites have been found in the east of France, in Switzerland, in the south of Germany, in Austria, in Slovenia and Croatia, northwestern Hungary, southwestern Slovakia and southern Moravia.

In this time, the social structure developed into a hierarchy. This can be documented by various things that were added to gaves, for example at Magdalenenberg. In the Bronze Age, people used to live in big settlements. As iron became available, trade routes changed. A new upper class could establish itself. Unlike before, these upper class people liked to live in big houses in the countryside, as a demonstration of their power. Funerary cults also changed, from cremation burials, to burials with . The new upper class used their wealth for import goods, mostly from the Mediterranean.

The Celts basically lived in clans. These were led by leaders, the Druids and Bards. Women were much better off than with the Romans, they were factually equal to men. There was Polygyny and Polyandry (A man could have several women, a woman could have several men).

Beowulf

Beowulf is an Old English heroic epic poem. It is not known who wrote it, but it was originally written down between the 8th and the 11th century. The only copy of "Beowulf" that still exists is from about 1010. "Beowulf" is 3183 lines long. 

The protagonist of the poem is Beowulf. The poem is named after him. In the poem, Beowulf fights three monsters: Grendel and Grendel's mother, and later in his life an unnamed dragon. 

Hrothgar, a Danish king, has built a big mead hall, which is called Heorot. Hrothgar and his people live a good life and celebrate in Heorot. But then they are attacked by Grendel, who comes to Heorot every night and kills some of Hrothgar's people.

Beowulf is a Geatic warrior from Geatland (modern southern Sweden). He hears of Hrothgar's troubles with Grendel. Beowulf and his men leave Geatland to help King Hrothgar.

Beowulf and his men stay the night in Heorot. When Grendel comes to kill them, Beowulf fights him. Beowulf tears Grendel's arm off from his body and sticks it on the wall as a trophy. Grendel runs to his home in the marshes, where he dies. Everyone is happy that Grendel is killed and celebrates. 
But the next night, Grendel's mother comes to Heorot and kills many people for revenge and grabs Grendel's arm. Beowulf then goes to the marshes where Grendel and his mother lived. Beowulf fights Grendel's mother and kills her.

Beowulf later becomes a king. He fights a dragon that was living in a barrow. With the help of the young man Wiglaf, Beowulf kills the dragon. But Beowulf is wounded in the final battle and dies.

The story of "Beowulf" has often been told in books, plays, and films. Sometimes the full story is told, sometimes just parts of the story. Sometimes the plot is altered. Sometimes only ideas or themes are taken from the story.

Romana (Doctor Who)

Romana, short for Romanadvoratrelundar, is a fictional character in the British science fiction television series "Doctor Who". She is a Time Lady from the planet Gallifrey, and she was a companion of the Fourth Doctor.
Because she was a Time Lord, Romana was able to regenerate, having two on-screen incarnations with somewhat different personalities (called Romana I and Romana II by fans). Romana I was played by Mary Tamm from 1978 to 1979. When she became pregnant and chose not to return for another series, the part was recast. Romana II was played by Lalla Ward from 1979 to 1981. 

The White Guardian assigns Romana to help the Doctor during his quest for the Key to Time. Romana first appears in "The Ribos Operation", and was intended as a contrast to her predecessor, the savage Leela. Romana is initially haughty and somewhat arrogant, looking down on the Doctor (whom she considers to be her academic inferior; she obtained a triple first at the Academy, while the Doctor passed with only 51 percent, on his second attempt) and responding to his initial resentment at her presence with icy put-downs. However, she soon gains an appreciation for the Doctor's experience and sense of adventure, and begins to respect him as a teacher.

The introduction of Romana's second incarnation in "Destiny of the Daleks", a script credited to Terry Nation, but with several changes by script editor Douglas Adams, treats the concept of regeneration humorously. At the beginning of the serial, Romana changes bodily forms several times, like she was trying on different outfits, before deciding to take the form of Princess Astra, who had been played by Lalla Ward in the final serial of Season 16, "The Armageddon Factor". 

Romana II enjoys a more intimate relationship with the Doctor than her first incarnation, some fans have assumed that she had a romantic relationship with the Doctor. Although a relationship was never shown or intended by the writers. In many ways, she is the companion most like her Doctor - besides being of the same race and close to the same intelligence, she occasionally mimics his sense of style, wields her own sonic screwdriver and can occasionally get the better of him in moments of banter and more practical situations. As her practical experience develops, she also becomes more assured and capable in the situations she finds herself in.

Her final television appearance was in "Warriors' Gate", where, along with the robot dog K-9, she leaves to forge her own path in the parallel universe of E-space. She also appears briefly in the 20th Anniversary special "The Five Doctors" through the reuse of footage from the uncompleted story "Shada" because Tom Baker refused to come back.

After the departure of both Romana I and II, both versions of the character also appeared very briefly in flashback sequences during the Fourth Doctor's regeneration in "Logopolis" as well as the Fifth Doctor's mind-copy in "Resurrection of the Daleks".

She would also be mentioned in "Castrovalva" during the Fifth Doctor's post-regenerative confusion, as well as "Arc of Infinity", where the Fifth Doctor, in response to a reprimand from the High Council of Time Lords for "leaving her behind", retorts that she "chose to remain in E-Space". 

In the new series the doctor says that all of the Time Lords apart from him were killed in the time war. Whether Romana was killed with the others, or is still alive in E-Space or elsewhere, has not been specifically established on screen.

An article by Russell T Davies in the "Doctor Who Annual 2006" states that Romana was President of the Time Lords during the Time War against the Daleks (see below), which ended with Gallifrey being destroyed. As with all spin-off media and the new series, it is unknown if it is canon.

In the licensed Virgin New Adventures novel "Blood Harvest" by Terrance Dicks, Romana II leaves E-Space and returns to Gallifrey with the help of the Seventh Doctor. In "Goth Opera" by Paul Cornell, from the complementary Missing Adventures series, she is given a seat on the High Council of Time Lords. In New Adventures' "Happy Endings", also by Cornell, it is revealed that Romana has become Lady President of Gallifrey. Romana's presidency is reflected in the later novels and in her appearances (voiced by Ward) in audio dramas from Big Finish Productions. Romana appears in independent charity novel Time's Champion, in the role of President of the Time Lords.
In the BBC Books Eighth Doctor Adventures novels, Romana undergoes a second regeneration, and her new incarnation (Romana III, whose appearance was modelled on silent movie actress Louise Brooks) is far less sympathetic and far more ruthless than the other two.

Romana II appeared pseudonymously in a series of audio plays produced in the early 2000s by BBV. In this series, Lalla Ward played a character who appeared with K-9 in an unnamed parallel universe. This character is called the Mistress (which was what K-9 called Romana in the television series). Because of an unusual copyright situation in which BBV was able to license K-9 but not Romana or other "Doctor Who" elements, the Mistress is not explicitly called Romana. For similar reasons, the parallel universe (obviously intended to reflect Romana's exile in E-Space) is called a "pocket universe" in the series' packaging.

In Big Finish's regular line of "Doctor Who" audio stories, Ward joined the Sixth Doctor in "The Apocalypse Element", in which Romana is Lady President of Gallifrey. In "Zagreus", Romana II is forced to banish the Eighth Doctor from the universe as he has become a danger to it following his infection by the forces of "anti-time". Following on from this, she is featured in a number of audio plays with former Doctor companion Leela (played by Louise Jameson) under the umbrella title of "Gallifrey". 

The series ends on a cliffhanger, with Gallifrey on the brink of economic and social collapse as well as in danger of being overrun by a Free Time virus, while most of the characters are trapped with no apparent means of escape.

Tegan Jovanka

Tegan Jovanka is a fictional character in the long-running British science fiction television series "Doctor Who". She was played by Janet Fielding. Tegan Jovanka was an Australian airline stewardess who was a companion of the Fourth and Fifth Doctors, she was a regular in the programme from 1981 to 1984. Tegan was the longest-serving companion in terms of years on the series (3 years, 1 month), although Jamie McCrimmon was in the most episodes and stories.

Tegan first appears in the Fourth Doctor's last serial, "Logopolis". On her way to Heathrow Airport to start her new job with Air Australia, her car suffers a flat tyre. She enters a roadside police box to seek help, but she enters and does not realise that it is the Doctor's Tardis. She is present when the Fourth Doctor falls from the Pharos Project radio telescope and regenerates into his fifth incarnation, and continues to travel with the doctor 
Eventually, the chaos during the events of "Resurrection of the Daleks" prove too much and she chooses to leave the Doctor and Turlough and stay in 1984 London.

According to David Tennant's video diary of filming "Doctor Who" Series 3, John Barrowman (who plays Captain Jack Harkness in the 21st century series of "Doctor Who" and its spinoff "Torchwood") has a dog named Tegan, named after the companion.

Empress Dowager Cixi

Empress Dowager Cixi (慈禧太后 Tz'u-Hsi T'ai-hou) (November 29 1835 – November 15 1908), popularly known in China as the West Dowager Empress (Chinese: 西太后), was from the Manchu Yehe Nara Clan. She was a powerful and charismatic figure who became the "de facto" ruler of the Manchu Qing Dynasty and ruled over China for 47 years from 1861 to her death in 1908. Though her exact origins are unclear it is very likely that she came from an ordinary Manchu family. She was chosen by the Xianfeng Emperor as a concubine, and so she gained almost total control over the court when the rule of her son the Tongzhi Emperor started. He and her nephew the Guangxu Emperor attempted unsuccessfully to rule in their own right. She was in Charge during the Opium Wars, First Sino-Japanese War, and the Boxer Rebellion. She was largely conservative during her rule, and many historians consider her reign despotism, and think that she might be responsible for the fall of the Qing Dynasty, and therefore Imperial China, as a result of Cixi's rule.

Human trafficking

Human trafficking (or Trafficking in human beings) is a way to exploit people. People are sold, bought, and traded much like slaves. It is estimated to be a $5 to $9 billion-a-year industry. Trafficking victims typically are recruited by using force or because they are deceived, or fraud is used, power is abused, or they are simply abducted. Threats, violence, and economic problems can often make a victim consent to exploitation.

Exploitation includes forcing people into prostitution or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs. For children exploitation may also include forced prostitution, illegal international adoption, trafficking for early marriage, or recruitment as child soldiers, beggars, for sports (such as child camel jockeys or football players), or for religious cults.

Jacques Offenbach

Jacques Offenbach (20 June 1819, in Cologne – 5 October 1880, in Paris) was a French composer and cellist of the Romantic era. He is seen as one of the originators of the operetta form. Of German-Jewish descent, he was one of the most influential composers of popular music in Europe in the 19th century. Many of his works are still played today.

Offenbach's many operettas, such as "Orpheus in the Underworld", and "La belle Hélène", were extremely popular both in France and elsewhere in the 1850s and 1860s. They combined political and cultural satire with witty grand opera parodies. His popularity in France declined in the 1870s after the fall of the Second Empire. He fled France, but during the last years of his life, his popularity came back. Several of his operettas are still performed. While his name remains most closely associated with the French operetta and the Second Empire, it is Offenbach's one fully operatic masterpiece, "Les contes d'Hoffmann" ("The Tales of Hoffmann"), composed at the end of his career, that has become the most familiar of Offenbach's works in major opera houses.

<doc id="98186" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=98186" title="Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec">
Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec

Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, (24 November 1864 – 9 September 1901) was a French painter of the Post-Impressionist period. He was born into a noble family, but lived for most of his life among the actors, dancers and prostitutes of Paris. He is famous for painting the lives of these people, the entertainment of Paris, and many portraits. 

He was expert at drawing and also made many printed posters to advertise entertainments.

In a 2005 auction at Christie's auction house a new record was set when "La blanchisseuse", an early painting of a young laundress, sold for $22.4 million U.S.

Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec Monfa was born in Albi in the Midi-Pyrénées Region of France. He was the oldest child of Count Alphonse and Countess Adèle de Toulouse-Lautrec. His mother and father were cousins. This is thought to have been a reason for his weakness and bad health. His younger brother was born on 28 August 1867, but died the following year.

Henri had two accidents when he was 13 and 14. He fractured (broke) the thigh bones of both his legs. They took a long time to heal, and never grew again. No-one knows exactly what caused this problem. As an adult he had a man-sized body but child-sized legs and was 1.54 m (5 ft 1 in) tall,

As a young man Toulouse-Lautrec was not able to do many of the things that other men of his age liked doing. He had been good at drawing from the time he was a child. He spent his time drawing and painting instead of joining in sports and hunting. He travelled to Paris where he met other artists as well as writers, actors and dancers. The "night life" (entertainment) of Paris had so many colourful scenes and people to paint. His paintings are famous for showing the scenes of modern life in a way they had never been shown before. 

Toulouse-Lautrec lived in Montmartre, a part of Paris that was famous for its "bohemian" people: artists, poets, philosophers and poor students. He was called "the soul of Montmartre". He often visited the nightclubs such as the Moulin Rouge. He also spent a lot of time at the brothels in that area, and lived for a time at the brothel at des Moulins where he was a good friend to many of the women there. 

Toulouse-Lautrec painted scenes of the lives of these people, which were very shocking to some people in the polite society of Paris. As well as showing the dancing, singing, acting and circus performances that many people enjoyed, he also showed people in bed together, the sad faces of people who were addicts and the half-naked prostitutes lined up for STD medical examination. Many of his pictures were of women in same-sex relationships.

He painted the singer Yvette Guilbert, the dancer Jane Avril and the dancer Louise Weber, who was known as "La Goulue" ("The Greedy-Guts") and who created the leg-kicking dance called the "Can-Can", which is still danced at the "Moulin Rouge" to this day. Toulouse-Lautrec gave painting lessons to Suzanne Valadon, who was one of his models and may have also been his girlfirend. 

Henri Toulouse-Lautrec was an alcoholic for most of his adult life. He was put into a psychiatric hospital shortly before his death. He died from problems cause by addiction and STD at his family's home in Malromé. He was nearly 37 years old. He is buried in Verdelais, Gironde, a few kilometres from his birthplace.

Throughout his working life of less than 20 years, Toulouse-Lautrec created 737 canvases, 275 watercolors, 363 prints and posters and 5,084 drawings. He also made some ceramics and stained glass 
After Toulouse-Lautrec's death, his mother, the Countess Adèle Toulouse-Lautrec, and his art-dealer Maurice Joyant made his art famous. His mother gave money for a museum of his works to be built in Albi, his birthplace.

Several films have been made about Toulouse-Lautrec:

<doc id="98255" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=98255" title="Rings of Rhea">
Rings of Rhea

The Saturnian moon Rhea may have a thin ring system with three narrow bands in a disk of solid particles. These would be the first rings seen around a moon. The discovery was announced in the journal "Science" on March 6 2008.

In November of 2005 the "Cassini" orbiter found that Saturn's magnetosphere near Rhea did not have energetic electrons. According to the discovery team, this is best explained by assuming they were absorbed by solid material in the form of an equatorial disk having denser rings or arcs, with particles perhaps many decimeters to about a meter in diameter. 

"Voyager" 1 saw an area without as many energetic electrons trapped in Saturn's magnetic field downstream from Rhea in 1980. These measurements, which were never explained, were made at a farther distance than the "Cassini" data. 

On November 26, 2005, "Cassini" made the one targeted Rhea flyby of its primary mission. It passed within 500 km of Rhea's surface, downstream of Saturn's magnetic field, and saw the resulting plasma wake as it had with other moons, such as Dione and Tethys. In those cases, there was a cutoff of energetic electrons as "Cassini" crossed into the moons' plasma shadows (the regions where the moons themselves blocked the magnetospheric plasma from reaching "Cassini)." However, in the case of Rhea, the electron plasma started to drop off at eight times that distance, and decreased gradually until the expected sharp drop off as "Cassini" entered Rhea's plasma shadow. The extended distance corresponds to Rhea's Hill sphere, the distance of 7.7 times Rhea's radius inside of which orbits are dominated by Rhea's rather than Saturn's gravity. When "Cassini" emerged from Rhea's plasma shadow, the reverse pattern occurred: A sharp surge in energetic electrons, then a gradual increase out to Rhea's Hill-sphere radius. 

These readings are similar to those of Enceladus, where water coming out from its south pole absorbs the electron plasma. However, in the case of Rhea, the absorption pattern is symmetrical. 

In addition, the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI) saw that this gentle gradient was punctuated by three sharp drops in plasma flow on each side of the moon, a pattern that was also nearly symmetric.

In August 2007, "Cassini" passed through Rhea's plasma shadow again, but farther downstream. Its readings were similar to those of "Voyager" 1. 

There are no images or direct sightings of the material thought to be absorbing the plasma, but the likely candidates would be difficult to detect directly. Further sightings are planned for "Cassini"'s first mission extension, with a targeted flyby scheduled for March 2, 2010.

"Cassini"'s flyby path makes interpretation of the magnetic readings difficult.

The obvious candidates for magnetospheric plasma-absorbing matter are neutral gas and dust, but the quantities required to explain the seen decrease in electrons are far higher than "Cassini"'s measurements allow. Therefore the finders, led by Geraint Jones of the "Cassini" MIMI team, argue that the decrease of electrons must be caused by solid particles orbiting Rhea: 
An analysis of the electron data indicates that this obstacle is most likely in the form of a low optical depth disk of material near Rhea’s equatorial plane and that the disk contains solid bodies up to ~1 m in size.
The simplest explanation for the symmetrical punctuations in plasma flow are "extended arcs or rings of material" orbiting Rhea in its equatorial plane. These symmetric dips bear some similarity to the way by which the Rings of Uranus were found in 1977. 

However, not all scientists are convinced that the seen signatures are caused by a ring system. No rings have been seen in images, which puts a very low limit at least on tiny dust-sized particles. Furthermore, a ring made of boulders would be expected to generate dust that would likely have been seen in the images.

Simulations suggest that solid bodies can stably orbit Rhea near its equatorial plane over astronomical timescales. They may not be stable around Dione and Tethys because those moons are so much closer to Saturn, and therefore have much smaller Hill spheres, or around Titan because of drag from its dense atmosphere.

Many suggestions have been made for the possible origin of rings. An impact could have brought material into orbit; this could have happened as recently as 70 million years ago. A small body could have been disrupted when caught in orbit about Rhea. In either case, the debris would eventually have settled into circular equatorial orbits. Given their long-term orbital stability, however, it is possible that they survive from the formation of Rhea itself. 

For different rings to exist, something must separate them. Suggestions include moonlets or clumps of material within the disk, similar to those seen within Saturn's A ring.

Geneva

Geneva (, , , , ) is the second biggest city in Switzerland. Only Zürich is bigger. Geneva is the biggest city in Romandy (the French-speaking part of Switzerland). 

It is situated where the Rhône River leaves Lake Geneva (French "Lac Léman") and is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva.

There are many international organizations in Geneva, including the headquarters of many of the agencies of the United Nations and of the Red Cross. A 2007 survey found Geneva to have the second highest quality of living in the world (narrowly outranked by Zürich).

Internationally, Geneva is strongly associated with the Geneva Conventions.

"Geneva" was first written about as a border town, set up to protect the Roman Empire against the fortified against the Helvetii. The Romans took the city in 120 B.C. In A.D. 443 it was taken by Burgundy, and with the latter fell to the Franks in 534. In 888 the town was part of the new Kingdom of Burgundy, and with it was taken over in 1033 by the German Emperor.
From 1154 the bishops of Geneva had the status of prince of the Holy Roman Empire since 1154, but the counts of Geneva and later the counts of Savoy were "guardians", always ready to take over from the bishops. In 1290 the counts of Savoy got the right to appoint a deputy ruler (vice-dominus) of the diocese, the title of Vidame of Geneva was granted to the family of count François de Candie of Chambery-Le-Vieux a Chatellaine of the Savoy. The vidame had some powers in the town. 

In 1387 Bishop Adhémar Fabry granted the town its great charter, the basis of its communal self-government, which every bishop on his accession was expected to confirm. The last Count of Geneva died in 1394, and the House of Savoy took over their land. In 1416 the counts became dukes, and kept trying to bring the city of Geneva under their control, often by making members of their own family to Bishops of Geneva. The city protected itself by joining the Swiss Federation ("Eidgenossenschaft"), uniting itself in 1426 with Berne and Fribourg.
In the Protestant Reformation Bern favoured the new Protestant teaching and demanded liberty of preaching for the Reformers Guillaume Farel and Antoine Froment, but Catholic Fribourg renounced in its union with Geneva in 1511. Later the Protestant leader John Calvin was based in Geneva from 1536 to his death in 1564. 

At the Congress of Vienna (1814-15) the territory of Geneva was enlarged to cover 15 Savoyard and 6 French parishes, with more than 16,000 Catholics; at the same time it became a part of the Swiss Confederation. The treaty said that Catholic religion was to be protected, and that no changes were to be made without agreement with the Holy See. Later, Pope Pius VII made the cities of Geneva and Lausanne a new diocese of and part of Geneva diocese that was in France part of the French diocese of Annecy. 

The Protestant and Old Catholic churches got money from the city taxes, but the Roman Catholics did not. On 30 June 1907, most of the Catholics of Geneva voted for the separation of Church and State.

Geneva is located at 46°12' North, 6°09' East, at the south-western end of Lake Geneva, where the lake meets the Rhône River. It is surrounded by two mountain chains, the Alps and the Jura.

The city of Geneva has an area of , while the area of the Canton of Geneva is . 

The altitude of Geneva is 373.6 m. That is the altitude of the largest of the Pierres du Niton, two large rocks in the lake, are used as the reference point for all surveying in Switzerland.
The second main river of Geneva is the Arve River which flows into the Rhône River just west of the city centre.

In Geneva, the winter is cold and generally a little cloudy. During the winter season, it is possible to go several days without thawing, and a day or two with severe freezes where the thermometer displays -10 °C. There are several days each month when, if anticyclonic conditions are stable, the clouds may stay for several days. From March, with temperatures rising it feels like summer in late May. However, the rain intensifies and often has a stormy character during the month of May. These may be short but strong storms depositing several centimetres of rain within just a few minutes. Summers are often hot and rather humid, although some may be more changeable, the mornings remain relatively fresh. During the summer season, the rains are less frequent but more intense. This is the season where you most likely get thunderstorms with hail. If the weather in early September is still hot, it cools down quickly to become really cold in November. The morning frosts are then reappearing. Autumn is also the season of mists, and the month of October is often the month with the most fog in the year. The fog can be very intense, restricting vision to less than 100 m in the areas outside the city.

The city's main newspaper is the Tribune de Genève, a daily newspaper founded on 1 February 1879 by James T. Bates, with a readership of about 187,000.
Le Courrier, founded in 1868, was originally supported by the Roman Catholic Church, but has been completely independent since 1996. Mainly focused on Geneva, Le Courrier is trying to expand into other cantons in Romandy. Both Le Temps (headquartered in Geneva) and Le Matin are widely read in Geneva, but both actually cover the whole of Romandy.

Geneva is covered by the various French language radio networks of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, in particular the Radio Suisse Romande. While these networks cover the whole of Romandy, special programs related to Geneva are sometimes broadcast on some of the local frequencies in the case of special events such as elections. Other local station broadcast from the city, including RadioLac (FM 91.8 MHz), Radio Cité (Non-commercial radio, FM 92.2 MHz), OneFM (FM 107.0 MHz, also broadcast in Vaud), and World Radio Geneva (FM 88.4 MHz), Switzerland's only English-language radio station.

The main television channel covering Geneva is the Télévision Suisse Romande; while its headquarters are located in Geneva, the programmes cover the whole of French-speaking Switzerland. Léman Bleu is a local TV channel, founded in 1996 and distributed by cable. Because Geneva is nearly surrounded by France, many French television and radio channels can be picked up in Geneva.

Theatre
Most theatre in Geneva is in French, however there are several companies that stage regular English productions.

Cinema
Movie going is a favorite activity in Geneva and there are plenty of theaters throughout the city. Most movies are dubbed into French. Because of the number of English speakers in the city movies may also be subtitled.

Restaurants
In has over 1,000 restaurants, so it is the undisputed capital of cuisine in Switzerland. However eating out can be expensive, and many people drive the few kilometres over the border into France where prices are lower.

Since 1818, a particular chestnut tree is used as the official "herald of the spring" in Geneva. The "sautier" (secretary of the Parliament of the Canton of Geneva) observes the tree and notes the day of arrival of the first bud. While this event has no practical impact, the sautier issues a formal press release and the local newspaper will usually mention the news. In 2007, the first bud appeared on 2 March.

Geneva celebrates Jeune genevois on the first Thursday following a Sunday in September. By local tradition, this commemorates when the news of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of Huguenots reached Geneva. The Genevois (people of Geneva) joke that the federal equivalent holiday, "Jeune fédéral", is celebrated two weeks later on account of the rest of the country being a bit slow on the uptake.

Genevans also traditionally celebrate the failure of a Savoyard attempt to invade the city in 1602. The celebration, which takes place in December, is called L'Escalade, and includes a parade in the Old Town, a marathon, and numerous costume parties across the city. Inhabitants generally eat vegetable stew to commemorate a fictional character called Mère Royaume who is said to have thrown boiling hot soup on the Duke of Savoy's men when they were climbing the walls of the city during the night (hence the name L'Escalade, which means "the climb" in French). Traditionally, children are encouraged to knock on people's doors and sing songs in old Genevan, while teenagers generally throw eggs and flour at each other. Another tradition is to cross a pot made of chocolate filled with marzepan vegetables while saying "and so perished the enemies of the Republic".

The main sport team in Geneva is Servette FC, a football club founded in 1890 and named after a borough on the right bank of the Rhône River. Servette was the only club to have remained in the top league in Switzerland since its creation in the 1930s; however, in 2005, management problems caused the bankruptcy of the club's parent company, causing the club to be demoted two divisions lower. It is now playing in second division. Geneva is also home of the Genève-Servette Hockey Club, who play in the Swiss Nationalliga A.

The city of Geneva is divided into 8 "quartiers" or districts, often made up of several conglomerated neighborhoods. On the Left Bank (Rive Gauche) these include Jonction, Centre / Plainpalais / Acacias, Eaux-Vives and Champel while the Right Bank includes Saint-Jean / Charmilles, Servette / Petit-Saconnex, Grottes / Saint-Gervaise and Paquis / Nations.

As of 2005, the population of the Commune (city) of Geneva was 185,028, while 441,000 people lived in the Canton of Geneva; around 960,000 people live in the Geneva urban community, which extends into Vaud Canton and neighbouring France. 

The population of the Canton is split between 148,500 people originally from Geneva (33.7%), 122,400 Swiss from other cantons (27.6%) and 170,500 foreigners (38.7%), from 180 different countries. Including people holding multiple citizenship, 54.4% of people living in Geneva hold a foreign passport.

While Geneva is usually considered a Protestant city, there are now more Roman Catholics (39.5%) than Protestants (17.4%) living in the Canton. 22% of the inhabitants claim not to be religious, the rest being shared between Islam (4.4%), Judaism (1.1%), other religions and people who did not respond.

Geneva's economy is mainly services oriented. The city has an important and old finance sector, which is specialized in private banking (managing assets of about 1 trillion USD) and financing of international trade. It is also an important centre of commodity trade. 

Geneva hosts the international headquarters of companies like JT International (JTI), Mediterranean Shipping Company, Serono, SITA, Société Générale de Surveillance and STMicroelectronics. Many other multinational companies like Caterpillar, DuPont, Electronic Arts, Hewlett-Packard, INVISTA, Procter & Gamble and Sun Microsystems have their European headquarters in the city too.

There is a long tradition of watchmaking (Baume et Mercier, Chopard, Franck Muller, Patek Philippe, Rolex, Raymond Weil, Omega, etc.). Two major international producers of flavours and fragrances, Firmenich and Givaudan, have their headquarters and main production facilities in Geneva.

Many people also work in the numerous offices of international organizations located in Geneva (about 24,000 in 2001).

Geneva Motor Show is one of the most important international auto-shows. The show is held at Palexpo, a giant convention centre located next to the International Airport. The show is so important that the "Jet d'Eau" is switched on for longer than usual because of all the visitors in the city during the show.

The city is served by the Geneva Cointrin International Airport. It is connected to both the Swiss railway network SBB-CFF-FFS, and the French SNCF network, including direct connections to Paris, Marseille and Montpellier by TGV. Geneva is also connected to the motorway systems of both Switzerland (A1 motorway) and France.

Public transport by bus, trolleybus or tram is provided by "Transports Publics Genevois" (TPG). In addition to an extensive coverage of the city centre, the network covers most of the municipalities of the Canton, with a few lines extending into France. Public transport by boat is provided by the Mouettes Genevoises, which link the two banks of the lake within the city, and by the "Compagnie Générale de Navigation sur le lac Léman" (CGN) which serves more distant destinations such as Nyon, Yvoire, Thonon, Evian, Lausanne and Montreux using both modern diesel vessels and vintage paddle steamers.

Trains operated by SBB connect the airport to the main station of Cornavin in six minutes, and carry on to towns such as Nyon, Lausanne, Fribourg, Montreux, Neuchâtel, Berne, Sion, Sierre, etc. Regional train services are being increasingly developed, towards Coppet and Bellegarde. At the city limits, two new stations have been created since 2002: Genève-Sécheron (close to the UN and the Botanical Gardens) and Lancy-Pont-Rouge.

In 2005, work started on the CEVA (Cornavin - Eaux-Vives - Annemasse) project, first planned in 1884, which will connect Cornavin with the Cantonal hospital, the Eaux-Vives station and Annemasse, in France. The link between the main station and the classification yard of La Praille already exists; from there, the line will go mostly underground to the Hospital and the Eaux-Vives, where it will link up to the existing line to France. Support for this project was obtained from all parties in the local parliament. 

Taxis in Geneva can be difficult to find, and may need to be booked in advance especially in the early morning or at peak hours. In addition, which may be surprising in a modern country like Switzerland, taxis often refuse to take babies and children.
Geneva is home to the University of Geneva, founded by John Calvin in 1559. Also, the oldest international school in the world is located in Geneva, the International School of Geneva, founded in 1924 along with the League of Nations. Webster University, an accredited American university also has a campus in Geneva. 

The city is also home to one of the most prestigious graduate schools of international relations, the Graduate Institute of International Studies. Other international schools include the International School of Geneva and Institut International de Lancy (founded in 1903).

The Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations is a private university located on the grounds of the Château de Penthes, an old manor with a park and view of Lac Leman. 

The Canton of Geneva's public school system has "écoles primaires" (4-12), "cycles d'orientation" (12-15), and the post-obligatory "collèges" (15-19), the oldest of which is the Collège Calvin. It is housed in the ancient buildings of the University of Geneva, and could be considered one of the oldest public schools in the world.

Geneva also has a wide choice of reputed private schools.

As the Geneva authorities say, the history of the city is closely related to that of the foreign communities. Ever since the migration of foreigners to Geneva, these communities have found refuge, bringing their know-how, their customs and hope of a new life. They have widely participated in the international influence of Geneva, to its economic prosperity, and also to the spreading of views and of science. 
Many other communities or minorities are also very well represented in Geneva, including sexual minorities, with no less than three organizations: Dialogai, a gay organization; Lestime, a lesbian organization; and association 360, an LGBT organization. The Gay International Group (Geneva, Switzerland) is a good resource for gay foreigners, tourists or expatriates. Also, a new LGBT group has debuted within the University of Geneva itself, called "Think Out". This group addresses students and professors linked directly or indirectly with the matter of sexual diversity.

There are a lot of different communities in Geneva. Even if Geneva is supposed to be the Protestant Rome, many religions are represented in Geneva. The Plymouth Brethren have a thriving assembly there, established since the days of John Nelson Darby. Besides the Protestants, the Catholic religion becomes more influential thanks to immigration from Latin countries. The Jewish community is one of the oldest of Switzerland, and the more recent Muslim community is emerging in this tolerant city.

Geneva is the seat of the European headquarters of the United Nations and of many other inter-governmental organizations, including:
Geneva was the seat of the League of Nations between 1919 and the league's dissolution in 1946. It was first housed in the Palais Wilson, and then in the Palais des Nations, which now hosts the United Nations. Numerous international non-governmental organizations have also elected Geneva as their headquarters, including:

Concubinage

Concubinage is the state of a woman in a relationship with a man of higher social status that gives her less rights than a marriage. In most of the cases the man has an official wife and one or more concubines. Concubines have only limited rights of support from the man, and their children have lower status than children born by the official wife or wives; these legal rights distinguish a concubine from a mistress.

Historically, the family of a girl were in favour of a concubinage with an mighty man, as it meant economic security for the woman. But concubinage could also mean sexual slavery of one member of the relationship, typically the woman, who was a pleasure slave to the man.

In the Western world there is no legal status of concubines, as only monogamous marriages are allowed. Any other relationship does not enjoy legal protection; the woman is necessarily a mistress.

Mistress (lover)

A mistress is a man's long term female sexual partner and companion who is not married to him. This term is especially used when the man is married to another woman. The relationship is generally stable; however, the couple do not live together openly. Also, the relationship is usually but not always secret. Rather often the man is paying for some of the woman's living expenses. A mistress has no legal relationship to the man, that makes the difference to the status of a concubine. 

The term can also be used to describe the "other" companion in a female same-sex marriage. Likewise, a woman may be married to a man and have a mistress of her own.

Historically, the term was used for women who could afford a comfortable lifestyle, because a wealthy man financed that so that she will be available for his sexual pleasure. Such a woman could move between the roles of a mistress and a courtesan. Today however, the word "mistress" is used primarily to refer to the female companion of a man who is married to another woman; in the case of an unmarried man it is usual to speak of a "girlfriend". 

The historically best known and most researched mistresses are the royal mistresses of European monarchs, for example Madame de Pompadour. 
In the courts of Europe, particularly Versailles and Whitehall in the 17th and 18th centuries, a mistress often had great power and influence. A king might hold numerous mistresses but have a single "favourite mistress" or "official mistress" (in French, "maîtresse en titre"), as with Louis XV and Mme de Pompadour.

Gibbon

Gibbons belong to the group of lesser apes. They are known for their ability to swing from one tree to another with great agility and swiftness. White-hand gibbons live in Sumatra, Thailand, and Malaysia.

Gibbons are known to be the best tree travelers in the animal kingdom. They almost seem to be flying as they swing themselves hand over hand through the trees. Like great apes, gibbons can also walk upright on the ground. When they walk on the ground, gibbons hold their long arms in the air to keep them from dragging. 

Gibbons are "singers" too. Their powerful voices travel for kilometers through the forests of Southeast Asia. At times, a male, a female, and their young get together and "sing" in a chorus. These sounds help groups of gibbons stay in contact. They also tell unwelcome visitors to stay away.

Gibbons stay busy for most of the day. They swing through the trees, looking for leaves, flowers, fruit, and insects to eat. When night falls, small groups settle down in familiar trees for a good night's rest.

Unlike most other primates, male and female gibbons are not very different in size and shape, although they may differ in color. The males are usually black, while the females tend to be ash blond. Female gibbons have one offspring per gestation period and live about 25 years.

Same-sex marriage

Same-sex marriage (also known as gay marriage) is a term for a relationship in which two people of the same sex live together as a family in a governmentally, socially, or religiously recognized marriage. 

Marriage by the civil law is presently available to same-sex couples at any place in some countries. The countries that have them are the Netherlands, South Africa, Canada, Argentina, Iceland, Sweden, Spain, Norway, Portugal and Belgium. The Netherlands was the first country to allow marriages of two people of the same sex in 2001..

Some countries have them in some places and not others, such as the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and the District of Columbia in the United States, and Mexico City in Mexico. 

In the Netherlands, a same-sex marriage law does not actually exist. Back in 2001, the existing (normal) marriage law was 'only' changed, so that it now includes marriage of same-sex partners. This means that same-sex marriage in the Netherlands is not different from a normal marriage; it's exactly the same. The Dutch law says the following:

That is consistent with the first article of the Dutch civil law, and with the Dutch constitution:

The first same-sex union in modern history was recognized by the government in Denmark in 1989.

Civil unions, civil partnership, domestic partnership, unregistered partnership/unregistered co-habitation or registered partnerships offer some of the benefits of marriage and are available in: Andorra, Australia (except Commonwealth law), Colombia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary (unregisterd co-habitation since 1996; registered partnership from 2009), Iceland, Israel, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway (no longer separate civil union as of June 2008 same-sex marriages are under same law as male-female-marriages), Portugal, Slovenia, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Uruguay. They are also available in some parts of Argentina, Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul), Mexico, the U.S. states of California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, Washington state, and the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.).

In the United Kingdom, civil partnerships have identical legal status to a marriage, and partners have all the same benefits and legal rights; ranging from tax exemptions and joint property rights, to next-of-kin status and shared parenting responsibilities. Partnership ceremonies are performed by a marriage registrar in exactly the same manner as a secular civil marriage.

The controversy over recognition of same-sex unions as marriages is a very important part of a larger debate about the definition of a family. Same-sex marriage is not considered as valid by many religions, including the Catholic Church and Islam. Many others, however, see same-sex marriage as important for all people to be equal. They sometimes say that religions who do not support same-sex marriage are intolerant (they do not show respect to other peoples' beliefs).

Various organizations exist in part to support the rights of homosexual or gay men and women to marry people of the same sex. One organization is the Human Rights Campaign or HRC.

Mario Kart DS

Mario Kart DS is a racing game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. It is the fifth game in the series and the first to use Nintendo's free online service, Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. The game was released in the North America, Australia, and Europe in November 2005, and in Japan in December 2005, and in South Korea in which it is the very first Wi-Fi Connection game launched in April 2007.

It got very good reviews, and scored an average of 91% from Metacritic.

Like other games in the "Mario Kart" series, "Mario Kart DS" involves characters from "Mario" games racing each other in go-karts on tracks themed from locations in the "Mario" series. The game, like other "Mario Kart" games, employs various weapons or items that players can use to help themselves or slow down others. These weapons make "Mario Kart" different from other racing games.

"DS" is the first handheld game title to have a battle mode, where up to eight carts have four balloons and battle each other until one wins. It is also the first "Mario Kart" game ever to have computer opponents in battle mode. Another change is that players start with one balloon and must blow into the microphone to blow up other balloons. With fewer balloons, players get better items, but run the risk of getting knocked out early. With more balloons, they are safer, but get items that are not as good.

"DS" is also the first online "Mario Kart" title. It uses the Wi-Fi Connection Service. Players use "friend codes" and pick four tracks to race. Some tracks cannot be played over Wi-fi because the game might slow down due to large obstacles.

Twilight (series)

Twilight is a series of fantasy/romance books by Stephenie Meyer. A film adaptation of "Twilight" came out in 2007, and "" in 2009.

In "Twilight", Bella moves from Phoenix, Arizona to Forks, Washington, to live with her father. She enrolls at Forks High School. There she meets the Cullens, a family of vampires. However, because they believe it is not right, they do not drink human blood – they only drink animal blood. Because of this, they call themselves "vegetarians". They are described as beautiful and extremely pale, with golden eyes that turn black when they become thirsty. They are strong and can run very fast. Their skin is ice-cold. After becoming vampires, they do not physically change anymore. They do not grow older. When in the sun, they sparkle "like thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface," according to Bella in "Twilight".

Bella quickly falls in love with Edward, the youngest of the Cullens at 17 (though he was born in 1901). Bella is attached to him even after she finds out he is a vampire. Only Bella knows they are vampires, so she must tell no one of their existence.

One night, the Cullens are playing baseball, with Bella watching, when a smaller coven of vampires meets with them. These vampires are not vegetarians – they do drink human blood. James, one of the coven, attempts to attack Bella. However, he did not attack because he was outnumbered. 

Although James left Bella alive, he is a "tracker". That means he hunts down his prey and kills it, which he thinks of as a game. He plans on tracking Bella. She goes to Phoenix, Arizona to escape the deadly vampire, but he blackmails her into going to meet him. They meet at Bella's old dance studio, where Bella learns that her mother is still safe. James almost kills her, but the Cullens save her before she is dead. They kill James and get Bella safely to a hospital. The doctors tell her that she will make a full recovery in time, though she has broken her leg.

"New Moon" starts on September 13, Bella's 18th birthday. she had been dreading this day, because it would make her older than Edward, her vampire boyfriend. An incident happens at her birthday party, and Bella gets hurt. The fresh blood is too much for Jasper, the Cullen least committed to their diet, and he tries to attack her. Carlisle, the oldest vampire of the Cullens and the one most in control of himself, fixes her wound, and then Bella goes home.

Edward believes he is putting Bella in too much danger just by being around her. The Cullens leave, and Edward says goodbye to Bella after telling her that he does not love her anymore. Before leaving, he makes her promise not to do anything reckless, and then promises her that this would be the last time she saw him. She tries to follow him after he leaves, but ends up getting lost in the woods. She is found later that night by Sam Uley, a Quileute man from the nearby Indian reservation in La Push.

After that night, Bella goes into a depressed state. She does not talk to anyone, except to answer direct questions. She does not do anything except go to school and work. This is too much for her father, and he tells her that he is going to make her go to Florida to live with her mother. Bella protests this, and to make her father happy, she and her friend Jessica go to a movie.

After the movie, Bella has a delusion in which she hears Edward's voice clearly in her head. She "wakes up" after this. She decides to break her promise to him that she would not do anything stupid. She visits Jacob Black, her childhood friend, to see if he can fix up two motorcycles that she got for free. They quickly become friends. Jacob makes Bella happy for the first time since Edward left her.

When they ride the motorcycles for the first time, Bella hears Edward's voice again. She realizes that she hears it whenever she is in danger. She hears the delusion again when she meets Laurent, the other male in James' coven. He tells her that Victoria, James' mate, is out to seek revenge on Edward for killing James. He is about to kill Bella, when five large wolves chase him down and kill him.

Bella also learns of Sam Uley the day she first rides the motorcycle. Sam Uley and his "cult," as Jacob describes them, are cliff diving (jumping off the cliff in la Push into the water below, for fun). Jacob is scared that Sam is doing something to control the young men on he reservation. When Jacob suddenly breaks off their friendship, Bella suspects that Sam has gotten to him. When Jacob sees how upset Bella is over their broken friendship, he makes her guess that he is a werewolf, because he cannot tell anyone that, and also that it is dangerous for him to be around her. He tells Bella that Sam is a werewolf, and his cult was actually a pack of the werewolves in La Push. He says that their purpose is to keep their reservation safe and they call them selves "protectors", and reveals that they were the wolves she had seen who had chased down Laurent. He tells her that they are still trying to kill Victoria.

The werewolves are hunting Victoria one day, and Bella is alone on the beach in La Push. she decides to go cliff diving. She nearly drowns in the water, but Jacob saves her. Alice "sees" Bella jump off the cliff (Alice sees visions of the future) and goes to Forks to try to help Charlie with the loss. But she finds Bella still alive, and Bella is extremely happy at their reunion. 

Rosalie, the only Cullen who did not like Bella, tells Edward that Bella is dead. He plans to kill himself by going to Italy and asking the Volturi, vampire "royalty," to kill him. Bella and Alice go to Italy to show him that she is still alive. After barely escaping the Volturi, Edward, Alice, and Bella go back to Forks with the rest of the Cullens. They return to Forks, and Edward tells Bella that he was lying when he told her he did not love her, and that he would never leave her again. Bella takes the Cullens' votes, and everyone except Rosalie and Edward say she should join their family as a vampire (Rosalie had issues with becoming a vampire, and did not want Bella to make a choice she would regret; Edward was afraid that vampires had no soul or afterlife, and did not want Bella to lose her soul).

In "Eclipse", Jacob and Bella's friendship is shaken by the Cullens' return. Jacob will not visit Bella, or answer any of her telephone calls. This has Bella upset and wants to visit La Push, but she is still grounded for her sudden disappearance to Italy. Charlie blames Edward for Bella's depression, and restricted the time he spends at his house.

Charlie suddenly ungrounds Bella one day, and she is free to see Jacob. But when she plans one night to go see him, Edward has disabled her truck so she cannot go. He says that young werewolves are unsafe, that they can lose control and end up hurting those near them. Despite this, when he is away hunting, Bella goes to see Jacob.

Meanwhile, a string of murders are happening in Seattle, and the Cullens believe there is a "newborn" vampire loose in Seattle. However, as the number of murders increases, they begin to suspect an "army" of newborn vampires. Jasper tells Bella of his part in vampire wars in the South. He explained how vampires would create armies of newborn vampires to take control of cities, where there was more blood.

While Bella is away at the Cullens' one night, an intruder breaks into her house and steal some of her things, to get the scent of her blood. The Cullens do not know why or how this happened, but Bella realizes, the day of her graduation, that whoever had broken in was part of the newborn army in Seattle. He had taken her things so the others could find her.

When the werewolves find out about the newborn army, they decide to help the Cullens fight them. This greatly relieves Cullens, and the werewolves are excited about the fight. Alice, with her visions of the future, sees the newborns coming to a clearing near Forks to attack. To make sure Bella is safe, she is to go to a place in the mountains away from the fight. To make sure no one can follow her scent, Jacob Black carries her there. Edward and one of the younger werewolves would stay with her there while the battle goes on.

While the Cullens and werewolves fight in the clearing, Victoria and her "mate" Riley, follow Edward's scent to where he and Bella are. Edward kills Victoria, and he and the werewolf both help kill Riley. By the time they have done this, the fight in the clearing is over. But when one of the werewolves is attacked from behind by a newborn vampire who had been hiding, Jacob Black tries to rescue her, and gets hurt.

The Volturi arrive just after the fight is over. When the Volturi leave after a sort discussion with Cullens about what happened, Bella goes home, and then goes to visit Jacob. Bella tells him she loves him, but she loves Edward more, and cannot live without him. The epilogue is from Jacob's point of view. He receives an invitation to Bella and Edward's wedding and a note from Edward, saying that if he were in Jacob's place, he would have wanted the choice to go to the wedding. This angers Jacob, and he runs away as a werewolf, "letting Jacob Black disappear."

The book begins a few days before Bella and Edward's wedding. Jacob Black has still not returned after running away in the end of "Eclipse".

The wedding goes on as planned. Jacob Black unexpectedly returns at the wedding, and is happy to see Bella again. However, things go awry when Bella tells him she is going to have a "real honeymoon" with Edward. Jacob loses control of himself and almost phases into a werewolf. However, he is restrained by Seth, Sam and Edward.

Bella and Edward go on their honeymoon as planned, at Isle Esme, an island Carlisle bought and named after Esme. Things go as planned until Bella learns she is pregnant with Edward's child . They immediately go back to Forks, as the baby has vampire strength and is threatening Bella's life. Edward wishes for Carlisle to do an abortion. However, Bella and Rosalie refuse to let him, though the baby is draining all of Bella's strength.

When Jacob learns that Bella is "sick" at the Cullens' house, he thinks she is undergoing transformation into a vampire. He is overcome with anger, and runs to the Cullens' house, planning to kill them all. However, when he learns that Bella is pregnant with Edward's child, he goes back to La Push to tell the other werewolves. Believing that a vampire child would endanger all humans in the area, the rest of the pack plans to kill Bella and the child. However, Jacob refuses to let them. He breaks away from the pack and returns to the Cullens' house, to warn the Cullens and to help protect them. Leah and Seth Clearwater also break off from Sam's pack to join Jacob's pack.

When Bella's strength is almost completely gone, the Cullens realize that she may need vampire nourishment–blood. This turns out to help Bella gain back her strength, though the baby's kicks are getting stronger and threaten to break her ribs.

Later, Bella's placenta detaches in an accident, and the Cullens rush her to their makeshift delivery room. Rosalie leaves her side, unable to stand the smell of blood. Edward cuts the baby out of Bella's stomach while Jacob performs CPR. Edward successfully delivers the baby girl, Renesmee (who is half vampire, half human), but Bella is in critical condition with a broken spine and the bleeding wounds from Edward's surgery. After letting Bella hold Renesmee for a moment, Edward injects his venom directly into her heart and bites her several times as well. For the next three days, she becomes a vampire.

After Bella becomes a vampire, she goes on her first hunt with Edward. While hunting, she smells human blood and begins to track it. However, she stops herself and turns back. The Cullens realize that she has self-control that no newborn vampire has ever had. After this, Bella wants to see Renesmee. Jacob who imprinted on Renesmee, wants to test her before she gets near the baby. Bella passes the test and gets to hold Renesmee. While holding her, Bella finds out for the first time that Renesmee can show people her thoughts.

One day, Jacob, Renesmee, and Bella go to hunt in the forest. They see Irina, from the Denali coven. Irina came to make peace with the Cullen family for not fighting with them against Victoria. However, Irina sees Renesmee and thinks she is an "immortal child", a child who was turned into a vampire. These children are against the Volturi's laws, so Irina goes to tell the Volturi. Alice sees the Volturi coming to fight and she leaves because she knows that Aro, one of the Volturi, wants her more than anything. The Cullens spread out to find any vampires that could witness that Renesmee is not an immortal child and that she grows everyday. Bella asks Edward to teach her how to fight. In this process she learns that her superpower is being a shield. This means that she can protect others from other vampire powers.

When the Volturi come, all the vampire witnesses tell them that Renesmee is not an "immortal child." The Volturi leave the Cullens in peace.

The story tells Bree Tanner’s life as a newborn vampire and her connection with the other newborn vampires turned by Victoria in order to kill Bella. Bree makes friends, with sort of love interest with Diego, another vampire of the group, since both of them feel that they have been used and have doubts about the real intentions of their leader, plus: her vision is different and bloodless than other newborn vampires. Diego mysteriously disappears, leaving Bree even more confused and disconcert. Through the road, Bree makes friends with Riley, a relegated vampire, because of his power to release a terrible smell which upset other newborns. He will convince her to participate into the battle, leading her to a terrible end in hands of the Volturi who we will get to know through Eclipse history.

Isabella Marie Swan was born on September 13, 1987 to Renée and Charlie Swan, a young couple living in the small town of Forks, Washington. Bella's parents divorced when Bella was six months old, and Renée took Bella with her when she moved to Phoenix, Arizona. She is the main character of the series. She leaves Phoenix, Arizona, to live with her father, Charlie, in Forks, Washington. Her mother, Charlie's ex-wife, had recently remarried to a minor league baseball player named Phil Dwyer. Because he played baseball, they were almost constantly traveling, and Bella felt like she was getting in the way. In Forks, Bella falls in love with Edward. In "Breaking Dawn", Bella is transformed into a vampire and has a special talent called "shield." The series revolves around the romance between Bella and Edward.

She has pale skin, brown eyes, and brown hair. She is extremely clumsy and non-athletic, and has a string of bad luck. Felix from the Volturi says in Breaking Dawn: "Immortality suits you...". She describes herself as never being the best at anything and never winning prizes as there were not any for reading books. She also hates anything to do with birthdays and expressing her feelings. She does not like being center of attention and hates her first days at Forks as it's a small town and nothing very interesting happens so she becomes the center of attention.

Charlie Swan is Isabella's father and he is the ex-husband of Bella's mother, Renee. He is the Chief of Police in Forks were he has resided alone since Bella was an infant. His hobbies include fishing and watching football games on television. Charlie is a very reserved person and does not hover over his daughter, Bella. He is good friends with Billy Black, Jacob`s father.
Charlie is weary of Edward and later favors Jacob over Edward. After he is told that Jacob was seriously injured while riding a motorcycle, Charlie changes his mind and sees Edward in a more favorable light. Charlie is over-protective of Bella and it would crush him inside if anything serious ever happened to Bella. He is embarressed when talking about feelings and Bella has inherited most of his core traits.

Edward Cullen is the youngest (physically) of the Cullens, at 17. He resists killing Bella even though her blood smells extremely appetizing to him. He has bronze hair and "liquid topaz" eyes. Like all vampires, he has extremely pale skin that sparkles in the sunlight, and can run at very high speeds (the fastest in his coven/family). He can also read people's minds. However, he cannot read Bella's mind.He feels that she is an enigma to him.He loves her more than his life and would like to give her everything present in this world.

He was born in 1901, in Chicago, Illinois, to his mother Elizabeth Masen. As a young man during World War I, he wanted to join the army. However, during an epidemic of the Spanish Influenza, his mother and father died and he became very sick. Carlisle, already a vampire, was working in the hospital at the time, and cared for Edward's mother as she died. Just before she died, she asked him to save Edward's life in the way "others do not have", and Carlisle wondered if she knew his secret. He took both Edward and his dead mother to the hospital morgue, and then he took Edward home and turned him into a vampire.

Jacob Black is a Quileute who lives on the nearby Indian reservation who knew Bella as a child. In the first book, Bella uses him to find out about the Cullens. He tells her the tribe's legends, unknowingly breaking the old treaty between the werewolves and vampires. He does not believe the legends are true.

In "New Moon", Bella becomes friends with Jacob after Edward leaves her. Their friendship becomes troubled when Jacob turns into a werewolf. He is told not to see Bella, because if he loses his temper, he will transform into a wolf and could end up hurting her if she is too close by. However, when Bella tells him that there is a vampire hunting her, he realizes that leaving her alone would be more dangerous than staying away from her. Bella visits Jacobs house and his father says he is not in. Bella refuses and bursts in and sees him sleeping. Bella then peers out the window and can see Jacobs ' Tribe Mates'. Troubled by what they had done, she storms outside yelling, "Sam". One of the pack gets ratty and Bella looses it, giving him a hard slap round the face. One of the other pack members told her to run. The werewolf Bella slaps gets so angry he turns into a werewolf. Jacob wakes up just in time.

In "Eclipse", Jacob openly tells Bella that he loves her even if she does not love him back. He eventually gets Bella to kiss him, finding out that she loves him too, but not as much as she loves Edward. At the end of "Eclipse", Jacob runs away to Canada to escape from his troubled human life and does not return until Bella's wedding in "Breaking Dawn" where he becomes overwhelmingly jealous of Edward and Bella's wedding and attempts to pick a fight. When Bella goes through "changes", he fights for her life as she dies while finding his place in the werewolf pack. In the end he imprints on Bella's daughter, Renesmee.

In all books, Jacob is a strong and true friend to Bella and an enemy to Edward. He loves Bella in each book, at different degrees. 
Renesmee is the daughter of Bella and Edward. Her name "Renesmee" is a cross between the names Renee and Esme. "Carlie" is a cross between Charlie and Carlisle. Her nickname is Nessie. Though Bella disapproves of this name at first (because "Nessie" is the nickname of the Loch Ness Monster) she comes to accept it.

Half-vampire, she has vampire strength which threatens Bella's life during the pregnancy. Despite the danger to her life, Bella does not let Carlisle preform an abortion. Even in Bella's tummy, Renesmee did not like to eat human food; Bella had to drink blood to feed her. Towards the end of the pregnancy, Edward began to hear Renesmee's thoughts from inside Bella, and found out that she already loved her mother, and tried not to hurt her. This made Bella even more determined to see the pregnancy through.

Renesmee grows more quickly and rapidly than human children. She was born only a few weeks after being conceived and continued to grow rapidly after being born. However, she will stop aging once she reaches full growth (the Cullen family discover this when they meet Nahuel, a half-human, half-vampire boy who is almost a century old). Renesmee has a special talent, like her parents; she has the ability to show her memories to whomever she touches. As an infant, she uses this ability to talk to people. She is very important to Bella and Edward as they do not know whether she will be able to live as a vampire or a human.

The son of an Anglican pastor, Carlisle was raised during a time of religious persecution. His father led hunts for witches, werewolves, and vampires all in the name of ridding the world of evil. As his father grew older, Carlisle was placed in charge of the raids. Carlisle wasn’t as enthusiastic about killing as his father was, but he was clever enough to discover a coven of true vampires living in the sewers of the city. He set a trap for the vampires and chased one down. Carlisle believes that the vampire was actually too hungry to run and consciously decided to attack. The vampire fell on Carlisle and left him bleeding in the streets after killing two other men and taking off with a third. Knowing how his father would react, Carlisle crawled into a cellar and buried himself in rotting potatoes for the three days of the change. When he emerged, he was a vampire. At first he tried to destroy himself by jumping from great heights or drowning in the ocean. Somehow, he was so repelled by what he was that he resisted feeding off of humans. He even tried to kill himself with starvation.Eventually the thirst was too powerful and he attacked a herd of passing deer. He found that living off of the blood of animals could sustain his life and was infinitely more humane than taking the life of a human. Over the course of two centuries, he developed a sort of immunity to the scent of human blood and was able to become a medical doctor. Carlisle is the one who changes Edward, Esme, Rosalie and Emmett into vampire. He is immune to blood now and therefore can be in a room covered in blood and not attack.

Karl Popper

Sir Karl Raimund Popper (28 July 1902 – 17 September 1994) was an Austrian and British philosopher and a professor at the London School of Economics. 

He is considered one the most influential philosophers of science of the 20th century, and also wrote a lot on social and political philosophy. Popper is known for the idea of empirical falsification.

Karl Popper was born in Vienna (then in Austria-Hungary) in 1902 to middle-class parents of Jewish origins, both of whom had converted to Christianity. Popper received a Lutheran upbringing and was educated at the University of Vienna.. His father had 12,000-14,000 volumes in his personal library. 
In 1919, he became attracted to Marxism. He joined the Association of Socialist School Students and also became a member of the Social Democratic Party of Austria, which was at that time a party that fully adopted the Marxist ideology. He soon became disillusioned, stopped believing in Marxism, and was a supporter of social liberalism for the rest of his life.

Community Identification Number

The Official Municipality Key, which used to be called the "Official Municipality Characteristic Number" or "Municipality Code Number", is a group of numbers used to tell the difference between different municipalities and areas. 

In Germany the Official Municipality Key has statistical goals and is given by the statistics offices of individual German states. The municipality key is given in times like moving house on the notice of some documents.

The municipality key has eight digits, which are set like this: The first two numbers tell people what the German state is. The third number say the government district (in areas without government districts a zero is used instead). The fourth and fifth numbers show people the number of the urban area (in a city without districts) or the district (in a city with districts). The sixth, seventh, and eighth numbers show the municipality or the number of the municipality-free area. 

08 1 11 000: Stuttgart


15 3 52 002: Aschersleben




In Austria the municipality key has five digits which are chosen like this: The first number shows the number of the Austrian state, the second and third numbers show the district, and the fourth and fifth numbers show the municipality.

3 25 21: Rappottenstein


9 07 01: Vienna - Neubau




The Swiss Federal Office for Statistics makes code numbers with up to four digits, which are given in the order chosen with the official order of the cantons, districts, and municipalities in Switzerland.

<doc id="98537" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=98537" title="Hexadecimal numeral system">
Hexadecimal numeral system

The hexadecimal numeral system, also known as just hex, is a numeral system made up of 16 symbols (base 16). It uses the common symbols in the decimal numeral system (0 through 9) and includes six extra symbols. These symbols are characters taken from the English alphabet: A, B, C, D, E and F. The hexadecimal system replaced the octal numeral system for much of the work done on computers. The most commonly used form of binary is the byte. This is eight binary digits (bits). Hexadecimal only needs two digits to show the information in one byte of data. As computers become more advanced, they tend to use larger groups of bits but they use multiples of 8 (16, 24, 32, 64, etc). Hexadecimal makes it easier to write these large binary numbers. Hexadecimal numbers are written with a "h" after the number. For example, 63h means 63 hexadecimal.

Hexadecimal is similar to the octal numeral system (base 8) because each can be easily compared to the binary numeral system. Hexadecimal uses a four-bit binary coding. This means that each digit in hexadecimal is the same as four digits in binary. Octal uses a three-bit binary system. 

Changing a number from binary to hex uses a grouping method. The binary number is separated into groups of four digits starting from the right. These groups are then converted to hexadecimal digits as shown in the chart above for the hexadecimal numbers 0 through F. To change from hexadecimal, the reverse is done. The hex digits are each changed to binary and the grouping is usually removed. 
To convert a number from hexadecimal to decimal, do the following:

1) Take the least significant hexadecimal digit. That is the digit on the right end. If it is 0 thru 9 leave it at that value. If it is A or above convert it to 10 thru 15. This will be the first item in a sum.

2) Take the second-least significant digit. That is next to the digit on the right end. Do the above but multiply the value obtained by 16. Add this to the sum.

3) Take the third-least significant digit and convert is as in 1) above, then multiply it by 16 (that is, 16 squared, or 256). Add it to the sum.

4) Repeat the above for more places. For each new place, add one more to the power of 16. Because hexadecimal uses extra symbols, it is important to remember the decimal value of each of the symbols: A = 10, B = 11, C = 12, D = 13, E = 14, and F = 15. 
Example: 5Fh and 3425h to decimal

Mie Prefecture

Mie Prefecture (三重県, Mie-ken) is located in the Kinki region on the island of Honshū, Japan. The capital city is Tsu.

In the past, the area that is now Mie Prefecture was three different regions. They were called Ise Province, Shima Province and Iga Province. After the Meiji Restoration, this area changed many times. In 1871, the area from the Kisosansen River in the north to the city of Tsu became Anōtsu Prefecture. The area south of Tsu became Watarai Prefecture. In 1876, Anōtsu Prefecture and Watarai Prefecture joined to become Mie Prefecture.

Mie Prefecture is on the eastern side of the Kii Peninsula. The prefectures that surround Mie are Aichi, Gifu, Shiga, Kyoto, Nara, and Wakayama. Mie is in the Kinki area of Japan, but it is also close to Nagoya. There are many mountains in the west and south of Mie, with the largest cities in the east, next to Ise Bay.

The size of Mie Prefecture is 5,776.44 km². 64.8% of Mie is forest, 11.5% is used for growing food, 6% is used for houses, 3.8% is used for roads, and 3.6% are rivers. The other 10.3% is used for other things.

There are fourteen cities in Mie Prefecture:

776 Berbericia

776 Berbericia is a minor planet orbiting the Sun in the asteroid belt. This main-belt asteroid was found by A. Massinger at Heidelberg January 24, 1914. It was named in honor of Adolf Berberich (1861-1920), a German astronomer.

In the late 1990s, a network of astronomers worldwide gathered lightcurve data that was mostly used to conclude the spin states and shape models of 10 new asteroids, including (776) Berbericia.

Richard P. Binzel and Schelte Bus added more to the knowledge about this asteroid in a lightwave survey published in 2003. This project was known as Small Main-belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey, Phase II or SMASSII, which built on a previous survey of the main-belt asteroids. The visible-wavelength (0.435-0.925 micron) spectra data was gathered between August 1993 and March 1999.

Chris Benoit

Christopher Michael Benoit (May 21, 1967 - June 25, 2007) was a Canadian professional wrestler. He is best known for wrestling in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).

Chris, his wife Nancy, and their 7-year-old son Daniel were found dead in their Fayetteville, Georgia home on June 25, 2007. 

During his youth in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, he was trained by Stu Hart. He wanted to become a wrestler because of Tom Billington, the Dynamite Kid. Chris Benoit began his career in the year 1985, when he trained in Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling promotion. In 1989, the promotion, Stampede Wrestling, closed, and Chris went to wrestle in Japan for NJPW. He wore a mask and called himself Pegasus Kid. 

In 1990, he won his first major championship, the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship, from Jushin Liger. He later lost the title (and his mask) to Liger, He changed his name to Wild Pegasus. As Wild Pegasus he won the Super Juniors tournament in 1993 and 1995.

Benoit left Japan to wrestle in Germany and Mexico. In 1994 he began working for ECW. In ECW he dropped the name Wild Pegasus. After an accident that broke Sabu's neck, he became known as "The Crippler" Chris Benoit.

Benoit worked for WCW starting in 1995. In 1998, he had a feud with Booker T. They fought in a "Best-of-seven-series" for the WCW World Television Championship. Booker won but he would end up losing the title to Finlay. This feud helped both mens careers.

In 2000 Benoit began wrestling for the WWE. In 2004 he took part in the Royal Rumble. He entered first and won when he eliminated The Big Show. After winning the Royal Rumble, he fought for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. At WrestleMania XX, he fought against Shawn Michaels and champion Triple H. Benoit won this match by making Triple H submit to the Crippler Crossface. At the end of this event, Benoit celebrated in the ring with the WWE Champion Eddie Guerrero. This is looked at as the biggest win in Benoit's Career. 

On the June 11 episode of RAW, Benoit was drafted from SmackDown! to ECW as part of the 2007 WWE Draft. Benoit won his first ECW match teaming up with CM Punk and defeating Elijah Burke and Marcus Cor Von.

On June 19, 2007, Benoit wrestled his last match. He beat Elijah Burke in a match to decide who would face CM Punk for the ECW World Championship at Vengeance. Benoit did not appear at the house shows during the weekend of June 23rd. He told WWE officials that his wife and son were sick due to food poisoning. When he did not show up for the pay-per-view, viewers were told that it was because of a "family emergency." Johnny Nitro took his place in the title match. Nitro won the match and became ECW Champion.

On June 25, 2007, Benoit, his wife Nancy, and their 7-year-old son Daniel were found dead in their Fayetteville, Georgia, home at around 2:30 p.m. EDT. Lieutenant Tommy Pope of the Fayette County, Georgia Sheriff's Department reported to ABC News that police entered Benoit's home on a Welfare Check after several missed appointments, leading to concerns. According to several articles on the event, WWE were the ones that called the police to check on the Benoits. Pope also stated the police were not searching for any suspects outside of the house, as the instruments of death were located at the scene of the crime. Detective Bo Turner of the Fayette County Sheriff's Department told television station WAGA-TV that the case was being treated as a murder-suicide. The station reported that investigators had discovered, and would eventually cite as an official ruling, that Benoit murdered his wife and son over the weekend and hung himself sometime on Monday.

It was first reported to fans of WWE on their WWE Mobile Alerts Service and posted to their official website soon after. On their website, World Wrestling Entertainment released the following statement:

WWE cancelled the scheduled three hour long live "Raw" show on June 25, and replaced the broadcast version with a tribute to his life and career, featuring his past matches, segments from the "" DVD, and comments from wrestlers and announcers. However, once the details of the events became apparent, WWE quickly and quietly began distancing itself from the wrestler by removing merchandise and no longer mentioning him.

Media accusations of steroid use and "roid-rage" quickly surfaced after the killings, prompting negative publicity against WWE and professional wrestling overall. Toxicology reports released on July 17, 2007 revealed that at their time of death, Nancy Benoit had three different drugs in her system: Xanax, hydrocodone, and hydromorphone, all of which were found at the therapeutic rather than toxic levels. Daniel Benoit was found to have Xanax in his system, which led the chief medical examiner, Kris Sperry to believe that he was sedated before he was murdered. Chris Benoit was found to have Xanax, hydrocodone, and an elevated level of testosterone, caused by a synthetic form of testosterone, in his system. The chief medical examiner attributed the testosterone level to Benoit possibly being treated for a deficiency caused by previous steroid abuse. There was no indication that anything in Chris' body contributed to his violent behavior that led to the murder-suicide, concluding that there was no "roid-rage" involved.

On August 30, 2007, Benoit was discovered to have been given illegal steroids not in compliance with WWE's Talent Wellness Program in February 2006. Benoit received nandrolone and anastrozole. Eddie Guerrero and Brian Adams were discovered to have been given steroids prior to their deaths during this investigation, as well as former WWE superstar Sylvain Grenier‎ and eleven other WWE superstars, who were suspended in accordance with the WWE Talent Wellness program.

After the double-murder suicide, former wrestler Chris Nowinski contacted Michael Benoit, father of Chris Benoit, suggesting that years of trauma to his son's brain may have led to his actions. Tests were conducted on Benoit's brain by Julian Bailes, the head of neurosurgery at West Virginia University, and results showed that "Benoit's brain was so severely damaged it resembled the brain of an 85-year-old Alzheimer's patient." It was also shown to have an advanced form of dementia and was similar to the brains of four retired NFL players who have suffered multiple concussions, sank into depression and harmed themselves or others. Bailes and his colleagues concluded that repeated concussions can lead to dementia, which can contribute to severe behavioral problems. Benoit's father suggests that brain damage may have been the leading cause of his crime. He also confirmed that his son was quietly cremated, but what was done with the ashes is not public knowledge.

WSB-TV in Atlanta, Georgia obtained the last known photograph of Chris Benoit. The photo was taken in the office of Dr. Phil Astin, on Friday June 22, 2007, just mere hours before the murders.

Jack (Tekken)

Jack is a character in the "Tekken" series. He has many succesors since Jack bots are usually destroyed.

Jack is the first robot in the Jack-bot series. It is unknown how it was destroyed. Jack was sent to get rid of Kazuya. Jack, unlike Jack-2, Gun Jack and Prototype Jack, did not appear in Tekken Tag Tournament making him the only Jack robot (before Jack-5) not to appear in more than one game.

Jack-2 is the second robot in the Jack series. He is an upgrade of the original Jack robot and was sent out to enter The King of Iron Fist Tournament 2 to save his creator and friend, Jane from the evil Kazuya Mishima. In his ending, Jane and Jack-2 are playing on an island together. Suddenly, Jack-2 gets shot by a laser from a satellite up in space that Doctor Abel uses to destroy Jack-2. 

Gun Jack is the third Jack robot. There was no Jack-3 created.

Jack-4 was not in any Tekken game as a playable character, but he can be seen in the Tekken 5 opening movie (these Jacks are sent to kill Heihachi Mishima).

ZX Spectrum

Sinclair's company produced seven different ZX computers, but other companies had deals with Sinclair Research to build their own version of ZX computers. The biggest of those companies was the American electronics manufacturer Timex who produced three different ZX based computers. Timex were selling between 18,000 and 20,000 of the ZX Spectrum based home computer every month by June 1981 but the Timex computer did not work properly so they had to stop selling them in 1983. Timex were the manufacturers who made most of the Sinclair Research ZX for Europe but the European versions worked correctly. The Sinclair Research version of ZXs were made until 1990 but other companies around the world copied the ZX and made many versions after that. When Sinclair Research stopped making the ZX Spectrum there had been more than 10,000 different games available and lots of peripheral equipment. Some companies still sell new games for the ZX.

Hipparchus

Hipparchus (Greek ; ca. 190 BC – ca. 120 BC) was a Greek astronomer, geographer, and mathematician. He lived in the Hellenistic period.

Hipparchus was born in Nicaea (now Iznik, Turkey), and probably died on the island of Rhodes. He worked as an astronomer at least from 147 BC to 127 BC. Hipparchus is considered the greatest ancient astronomical observer. Some people see him as the greatest overall astronomer of antiquity. He was the first Greek whose quantitative and accurate models for the motion of the Sun and Moon survive. To get to these models, he certainly made use of the observations and perhaps the mathematical techniques accumulated over centuries by the Chaldeans from Babylonia. He had a trigonometric table. It looks like he solved some problems of spherical trigonometry with the table. With his solar and lunar theories and his trigonometry, he was perhaps the first to develop a reliable method to predict solar eclipses. His other well-known achievements include the discovery of precession, the compilation of the first comprehensive star catalog of the western world, and possibly the invention of the astrolabe. He might also have invented the armillary sphere which first appeared during his century and was used by him during the creation of much of the star catalogue. It would be three centuries before Claudius Ptolemaeus' synthesis of astronomy would make the work of Hipparchus obsolete; it is heavily dependent on it in many areas.

Battle of Verdun

The Battle of Verdun was a battle of the First World War. It started when German troops attacked French positions, near Verdun, on February 21, 1916. It ended on December 18 of that year. The front line had not changed very much. Both sides lost about 337,000 soldiers each, which means about half of them died. Many historians see this battle as the bloodiest of World History. Never before was industrialisation so visible in war. They also speak about the "Hell of Verdun" or the "Blood pump". The Battle of Verdun is considered the biggest and longest in world history. Never before or since has there been such a long battle, involving so many men, fought on such a tiny piece of land. The battle, which lasted from 21 February 1916 until 19 December 1916 caused over an estimated 700,000 casualties (dead, wounded and missing). The battlefield was not even a square ten kilometres. From a strategic point of view, there can be no justification for these terrible losses. The battle lowered into a matter of prestige for the two nations, and started being fought literally for the sake of fighting.

King Penguin

The King Penguin ("Aptenodytes patagonicus") is a type of penguin. It is the second largest species of penguin, as it is smaller and shorter than the Emperor Penguin.

King Penguins are usually 70 centimeters (0.7 meters/30 inches) tall and weigh 9 to 15 kilograms (20 to 30 pounds). They have silvery-grey backs, black heads, and bright orange patches of feathers on the sides of their necks. While they look like Emperor Penguins, they are different in the fact that King Penguins have longer beaks, orange coloration on their chest, and are thinner than the Emperor Penguin. Males and females of the species look the same.

The King Penguin eats krill, small fish, squid, and plankton. In particular, they seem to enjoy eating lanternfish, which makes up most of their diet. They are able to dive to almost 300 meters (about 985 feet) for up to 15 minutes in order to catch their food. King Penguins can also swim at 10 kilometers (6 miles) per hour, and their special eyesight helps them see in the dark.

Unlike most penguins, the King Penguin cannot hop, but can only use its feet to walk or run. However, they also use their feet to warm their children, instead of a nest.

Baby King Penguins are dark brown and fluffy. They are usually raised in a crèche, or group of penguin children kept together for protection.

The King Penguin's main predators, or creatures that eat it, are the leopard seal and killer whale. Other birds may attack the penguin's breeding, or nesting, grounds and take away eggs or young penguin chicks.

He came after John Marshall and despite the many influential things done by his predecessor, still was able to write several major opinions. His decision in Dred Scott to send a slave living in a free state back to his master in a slave state canceled out several compromises that had been keeping the Union together. When president Abraham Lincoln began using powers not normally given to the presidency to put certain rights on hold, he repeatedly attempted to overrule him, which was ignored and rumored to have almost led to his arrest.

Combustion is a word that means burning. An engine is a machine that can push or pull (usually push). A combustion engine is a machine that makes small explosions inside a sealed box (cylinder). The explosions push a rod which is attached to a wheel. The pushing makes the wheel spin around. The spinning wheel is attached to other wheels, such as four car wheels, with a belt or a chain. The engine is very strong and can make all the wheels move. Engines need oil to make them slippery or the moving parts would grind together and stick. Parts of a car engine are measured to 0.01 of a millimeter and some engine parts fit together very, very tightly. 

Rockets that go into space are combustion engines but they do not have wheels inside. The fire in a rocket combustion engine is so strong that it blows the rocket the same as blowing a piece of paper.

B. B. King

B. B. King (born Riley B. King in Mississippi on September 16, 1925) is an American blues guitarist and singer-songwriter. "Rolling Stone" magazine said that King was the 3rd "Greatest Guitarist of All Time" in 2003.

He was born in Indianola, Mississippi. His father left the family and his mother was too poor to raise him, and so he came to his grandmother, Elnora Farr, in Kilmichael, Mississippi. There he sang in the gospel choir at Elkhorn Baptist Church. At the age of 15 he bought his first guitar. His idols were T-Bone Walker, but also jazzmusicans like Charlie Christian and Django Reinhrad. 1943 he left the town and worked as a tractor driver. He performed on Sonny Boy Williamson's radio program on KWEM in West Memphis, Arkansas and reached a local audience with his sound. For this reason he got appearances in the Sixteenth Avenue Grill in West Memphis and later, a ten-minute spot on the Memphis radio station WDIA. This became so poular that it was expanded and became the "Sepia Swing Club." During his work for the radio station he got his nickname "Beale Street Blues Boy" which was later shortened to B. B.

In 1949, King began recording songs for RPM Records from Los Angeles. King formed his own band; the B.B. King Review, under the leadership of Millard Lee and went on tours. 

In winter 1949 he played at a dance hall in Twist, Arkansas. The hall wa heated by burning barrels filled with kerosine. During his performance two men started a fight knocking over one of them and the hall was burning. Outside he learned that he had left his guitar and he ran inside to get her. Next day he found out that the fight was started over a woman named Lucille. Since that time he named his guitars "Lucille"

In the 1950´s B.B. King became one of the most important bluesmusicans. He toured regularly. 1956 he gave 352 conzerts. Among his hits were "3 O'Clock Blues", "You Know I Love You," "Woke Up This Morning," "Please Love Me," "When My Heart Beats like a Hammer," "Whole Lotta Love," "You Upset Me Baby," "Every Day I Have the Blues", "Sneakin' Around," "Ten Long Years," "Bad Luck," "Sweet Little Angel", "On My Word of Honor," and "Please Accept My Love." 

In the 1960 King lost importance for black listeners but could reach the white musicfans. A lot of white guitarist like Eric Clapton named him as influence. King played at rockconcerts and venues of the hippiculture like the Fillmore West. He also reached #15 in the Us-popcharts with his title "The Thrill Is Gone" .From the 1980s onward he has continued his career, appearing on numerous television shows and performing 300 nights a year. The titel "When love comes to town", which he performed together with the rockband U2 introduced him to a younger audience.

B.B. King was married two times. The marriages ended because of the burden of more than 200 concerts a year. It is reported that he is father of 15 children. He has lived with Type II diabetes for over twenty years and is a high-profile spokesman in the fight against the disease.

B.B. King has made guest appearances in numerous popular television shows, including The Cosby Show, The Young and the Restless, General Hospital, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Sesame Street, Married... with Children, Sanford and Son, and Touched by an Angel. He has also made a cameo in the movie Spies Like Us. In the Film Blues Brothers 2000 he was the leader of the The Louisiana Gator Boys, a bluessupergroup, which battles against the Blues Brothers.

He is the owner of a chain of restaurants with concert venues in the United States. The first was opened on Beale Street in Memphis 1991.

King was given a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987. As of 2009, he has won 15 Grammy Awards, of which ten have been the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album :in 2009 (for One Kind Favor), 2005 (B. B. King & Friends: 80), 2003 (for A Christmas Celebration of Hope), 2001 (for Riding with the King), 2000 (for Blues on the Bayou), 1994 (for Blues Summit), 1992 (for Live at the Apollo), 1991 (for Live at San Quentin), 1986 (for My Guitar Sings the Blues) and 1984 (for Blues 'N' Jazz).

Uluru

Uluru, also called Ayers Rock, is a name given to a huge rock near Alice Springs in the Australian Outback. This is a holy place for Australian aborigines. It is located at the Western Desert, in the middle of Australia. It was listed as a World Heritage site in 1987 because of its geology. In 1997 it was again listed as a World Heritage site, this time because of its importance to the Anangu people. It was the second place in the world to be listed as culturally significant, and it is one of the few places in the world to have two listings.
The Anangu people believe that Uluru, and the rest of Central Australia, was formed by ancestral beings at the beginning of time. The Anangu are directly descended from these ancestors. 

Modern science shows that they have lived around Uluru for more than 40,000 years. They continued to live their traditional life until the 1930's. This was a nomadic life, moving around to hunt and gather food according to the seasons. They have a complex ceremonial life based around Uluru. They are one of the oldest human societies on earth.

The first Europeans to see Uluru were explorers led by William Christie Gosse. He saw Uluru on 19 July 1873 and named it Ayers Rock after Sir Henry Ayers, who was Chief Secretary of South Australia. The land was too dry and remote for farming, and very few people came to Uluru until the mid 20th century.

Elapid

The Elapidae, or elapids, are a family of venomous snakes. These snakes can be found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. They can also be found in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific. They are characterized by a set of hollow, fixed fangs through which they inject venom. There are snakes of different sizes, from only 18 cm ("Drysdalia") up to 6 m in length ("King Cobra"). Currently, 61 genera with 231 species are known.

Those elapids that live on land look a lot like the colubrids: almost all have long and slender bodies with smooth scales, a head that is covered with large shields and not always distinct from the neck, and eyes with round pupils. In addition, their behavior is usually quite active and most are oviparous. There are exceptions to all these generalizations: For example, the death adders ("Acanthophis") include short and fat, rough-scaled, very broad-headed, cat-eyed, live-bearing, sluggish ambush predators with partly fragmented head shields.

Some species spend most of their lives in trees or bushes; this is called arboreal (African "Pseudohaje" and "Dendroaspis", Australian "Hoplocephalus"). Many others are specialised burrowers (e.g. "Ogmodon", "Parapistocalamus", "Simoselaps", "Toxicocalamus", "Vermicella"). Some species have very generalised diets. Others have specialised on a certain kind of prey. They have also adapted themselves, to better be able to feed on other snakes, certain lizards, squamate eggs, mammals, birds, frogs, fish, etc. 

Sea snakes, which are also elapids, have adapted to a marine way of life in different ways. All have evolved their tails so they can be used for swimming. They can also excrete salt. Most also have changed bodies, better suited for swimming. Ventral scales are much reduced in size, the nostrils of the snakes are located dorsally (no internasal scales). They give birth to live young (ovoviviparous). In general they have the ability to breathe through their skin; experiments with the yellow-bellied sea snake, "Pelamis platurus", have shown that this species can satisfy about 20% of its oxygen requirements in this manner. Thia makes it possible to stay underwater longer. The sea kraits ("Laticauda sp. "), are the least well-adapted to an aquatic life. They spend much of their time on land where they also lay their eggs (oviparous). They have wide ventral scales, the tail is not as well-developed for swimming, and their nostrils are separated by internasal scales.

All elapids have a pair of proteroglyphous fangs that are used to inject venom from glands located towards the rear of the upper jaws. The fangs are the first two teeth on each maxillary bone, which are enlarged and hollow, and usually only one is in place on each side at any time. The maxilla is intermediate in length and mobility between typical colubrids (long, less mobile) and viperids (very short, highly mobile). When the mouth is closed, the fangs fit into grooved slots in the buccal floor; in the longest-fanged elapids (e.g. "Acanthophis", "Oxyuranus") it is common for the fangs to pierce right through the intermandibular skin, which does not seem to endanger the snake. The fangs are usually below the front edge of the eye and are angled backwards; due to this construction, most elapids must actually bite in order to envenomate. This action is therefore not as quick as with the viperids, that can envenomate with only a quick, stabbing motion. Some elapids ("Acanthophis", "Oxyuranus", and especially "Dendroaspis") have long fangs on quite mobile maxillae (the prefrontal and ectopterygoid contacts are nearly as close together as in viperids), and can therefore make very fast stabbing strikes like viperids. A few species are capable of spraying their venom from forward facing holes at the tips of their fangs as a means of defense. Elapids use their venom both to immobilize their prey and in self-defense.

All elapids are venomous and many are potentially deadly. The venoms are mostly neurotoxic and are considered more dangerous than the mainly proteolytic viper venoms. Members include the black mamba ("Dendroaspis polylepis"), a species many regard as the world's most dangerous snake, the fierce snake ("Oxyuranus microlepidotus"), which is the most venomous land snake to mice, and "Hydrophis belcheri", a sea snake and the most toxic venom of all snakes.

Colubrid

A colubrid (from Latin "coluber", snake) is a snake that is a member of the Colubridae family. It is a broad classification of snakes that includes well over half of all snake species on earth. A colubrid's body is almost completely covered in scales. While most colubrids are non-venomous (or have venom that is not known to be harmful to humans) and are normally harmless, a few groups, such as genus Boiga, can produce medically significant bites. In addition, the Boomslang and African Twig Snake have both caused human fatalities.The venom-injecting fangs associated with venomous colubrids are almost always in the back of the mouth, compared to vipers and elapids. The Colubrids are certainly not a natural group, as many are more closely related to other groups, such as elapids, than to each other. This family has classically been a dumping ground for snakes that do not fit anywhere else. There is on-going mitochondrial DNA research which will sort out the familial relations within this group.

Sea snake

Sea snakes, or "seasnakes", are poisonous elapid snakes that live in marine environments for most or all of their lives. Together with sea turtles they are among the best-known marine reptiles. They evolved from their ancestors who lived on land. Some sea snakes still have some of the behaviour and traits of their ancestors left (like Laticauda who can also move a little on land). Most sea snakes are well adapted to living in the water all the time. They are unable to even move on land. 

Sea snakes are found in warm coastal waters from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific. They live in the tropical and warm regions, and they can not be found in the Atlantic Ocean, along the North American coast, or in the Caribbean Sea.

Most sea snakes grow to sizes between 1.2m and 1.4m, some can reach 2m or more. Hydrophis cyanocinctus have been found to reach 2.5m, Hydrophis spiralis 3m. They reach a weight of about 0.8 -1.3kg, at a size of 1.8m. In most cases, females are larger than males. 

All sea snakes have paddle-like tails and many have laterally compressed bodies – they look somewhat like eels. However, unlike fish, they do not have gills and must come to the surface regularly to breathe. Nevertheless, they are among the most completely aquatic of all air-breathing vertebrates. Among this group are species with some of the most potent poisons of all snakes. Some have gentle dispositions and bite only when provoked, while others are much more aggressive. Currently, 17 genera are described as sea snakes, with 62 species. They are usually 3 to four feet long.

All snakes are good swimmers, but only real sea snakes live their whole lives in the ocean. Not only do they live there, they eat there and even have their young right inside the water. They can not even live on land. If they accidentally get forced onto land by a storm or powerful currents, they are unable to move. Sea snakes have no "scutes" (special scales on snakes' bellies that help them grip and slither across the ground), so if a sea snake ends up on a beach, it is unable to slither back out to sea. Instead, sea snakes have a -shaped tail. The tail needs to be paddle-shaped so the snake can swim well. 

Sea snakes also have special nostrils that can close when they go underwater and open when they come up to breathe, like the blowhole of a whale (scientists call these "valved" nostrils). The nostrils are found high up on the head so that the entire snake can stay under the water when they come up to breathe. As a sea snake looks for food, sometimes it has go dive deep down into the water and hold its breath for a long time. So, they have a lung that is almost as long as its whole body. 

Most sea snakes are able to breathe through their skin. This is unusual for reptiles, because their skin is thick and scaly.Experiments with the black-and-yellow sea snake, "Pelamis platurus" (a pelagic species), have shown that this species can satisfy about 20% of its oxygen requirements in this manner, which allows for prolonged dives.

A sea snake can take one breath and stay under water for two whole hours. 

Like other land animals that have adapted to life in a marine environment, sea snakes swallow considerably more salt than their relatives living on land. They do this through their diet and when they inadvertently swallow sea water. This means that they had to find a better way to regulate the concentration of salt in their blood that those of their land-living relatives.Mammals have the advantage of being able to pass salt in solution, mostly in the urine, but kidney function in birds and reptiles is too weak to remove enough salt. In birds, such as penguins, salt is removed through nasal glands. The marine iguanas of the Galapagos Islands use the same mechanism. Sea turtles have lacrimal glands that allow them to produce very salty tears. But in sea snakes, the posterior sublingual glands, located under and around the tongue sheath, evolved to allow them to expel salt with their tongue action.

Most sea snakes have strong poisons. When bites occur, only a small amount of poisons is injected. For this reason, the symptoms of the poisoning are only seen as trivial, or do not exist at all. For example, "Pelamis platurus" has a venom more potent than any other terrestrial snake species in Costa Rica. The snake is very common in the waters of the western coast of Costa Rica. Despite this, few human deaths have been reported. Nevertheless, all sea snakes should be handled with great caution.

Bites in which poisoning occurs are usually painless and may not even be noticed when contact is made. Teeth may be left in the wound. There is usually little or no swelling involved and it is rare for any nearby lymph nodes to be affected. The most important symptoms are rhabdomyolysis (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and paralysis. Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. Symptoms that can occur after 30 minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and trismus, which is similar to tetanus, is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other elapid poisonings: a progressive flaccid paralysis, starting with ptosis and paralysis of voluntary muscles. Paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal. After three to eight hours, myoglobin may start to show up in the blood plasma. This is a result of muscle breakdown. It can cause the urine to turn a dark reddish, brown, or black in color, and eventually lead to kidney failure. After six to twelve hours, severe hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrest. The hyperkalemia is also the result of muscle breakdown.

Most sea snakes have extremely poisonous venom, though some do not. Of the more than fifty species of sea snakes, almost all of them are dangerously poisonous. Though the of many snakes take some time to begin working, sea snake venom is quite fast acting: it can its victim instantly. One bite makes the prey unable to move. This helps sea snakes catch the that they want (most of their prey is slippery). All they have to do is bite their prey, and it cannot escape.

The fact is, sea snake venom is known to be the most poisonous of all snakes. The most feared sea snake is the beaked sea snake found in the South Pacific. It has fangs that are so long they can a thick . One drop of its venom can kill five adult men, and it has enough of this powerful venom that if it was all released, it could kill 53 grown men.

Sea snakes can bite and release its venom up to an hour after it is dead, even if its head is cut off. This is because the snake's bite is still active for some time after it has died.

When you are bitten by a sea snake, you can see a number of happening to you. Symptoms are often slow but they may happen in minutes or up to 8 hours after a sea snake bite. These are the symptoms:

Trench warfare

Trench warfare is a war tactic, or way of fighting. It was commonly used on the Eastern Front and the Western Front in the First World War.

In trench warfare, the two sides fighting each other dig trenches in a battlefield. These trenches have many different parts, such as bunks, headquarters, artillery, and machine gun bunks. Between the two trenches on a battlefield, there was an area called "no man's land". This area was often covered with barbed wire and land mines. Soldiers on either side would try to cross the no man's land to get to the enemy's trench and attack. Tanks were commonly used to cross this land.

Trench warfare was used because it gave soldiers cover while defending themselves against attack. It also gave soldiers bunks to sleep in, although the bunks were very unclean and uncomfortable.

Port-de-Paix (Kréyòl: "Pòdepè" or "Pòdpè"; in English means "Peace Port") is a city and the capital of the département of Nord-Ouest in Haiti on the Atlantic coast.

The city is close to the mouth of the river Trois-Rivières, one of the most important river in Haiti. It has a population of 115,000 (2003 census), with 25,000 living in the city.

Christopher Columbus came to this region on 15 December 1492 and he gave it the name "Valle del Paraíso" or "Valparaiso" (Spanish for "Paradise Valley") because he found that this was a very beautiful valley.

A ferry operates between the town and Tortuga Island (La Tortue) situated just across the water.

The town was founded in 1665 by French buccaneers (a kind of pirates in the Caribbean) from Tortuga Island when they had to leave the island. In 1676 the town saw the first black slave revolt; its leader was "Padre Jean" (also "Padrejean" and "Pedro Juan") and who was killed by buccanneers in 1679 in the mountains close to Port-de-Paix.

The area saw great success during the 19th century and Port-de-Paix was an important port; from here, bananas and coffee were sent to other countries. In 1902 the town was almost entirely destroyed by fire.

Port-de-Paix is also the chief town of an arrondissement (a part of a department) of the same name. The arondissement consists of four communes (like municipalities): Port-de-Paix, Bassin Bleu, Chansolme and Tortuga Island.

Device controller

A device controller is a part of a computer system that makes sense of the signals going to, and coming from the CPU. There are many device controllers in a computer system. Any device connected to the computer is connected by a plug and socket, and the socket is connected to a device controller. Device controllers use binary and digital codes.
Each device controller has a local buffer and a command register. It communicates with the CPU by interrupts.
A device's controller plays an important role in the operation of that device; it functions as a bridge between the device and the operating system.

The Device Controller receives the data from a connected device and stores it temporarily in some special purpose registers (i.e. local buffer) inside the controller. Then it communicates the data with a Device Driver . For each device controller there is an equivalent device driver which is the standard interface through which the device controller communicates with the Operating Systems through Interrupts. Device controller is a hardware whereas device driver is a software.
The controller's job is to convert the serial bit stream to block bytes and perform any error correction necessary.

Rostov on Don

Rostov-on-Don (Russuan:Росто́в-на-Дону́, "Rostov-na-Donu" ) is a city in the European part of Russia. It is located on the River Don, about 46 km before it flows into the Sea of Azov. The city is the administrative center of Rostov Oblast and the Southern Federal District of Russia. About 1 million people live in the city (as of 2002).

The mouth of the Don River has been very impotant since the ancient times. It has been important for cultural reasons and for trade. The Greek colony "Tanais" was there, and also the Genoese fort Tana. Later, the Ottoman Empire built a fortress there. This fortress was named Azov.

Rostov-on-Don was founded in 1749. In that year, a customs house was built on the Don. Later, a large fortress followed. It was named after Saint Dimitry of Rostov. Dmitry of Rostov was a bishop from the old Northern town Rostov the Great. With the time, the importance of the fortress Asov became less and less. The settlement near the fortress became more important than the fortress. It was the commercial centre of the region. In 1796 this settlement received city rights and was renamed Rostov-on-Don.

The Don River that the city is named afrer is a major shipping lane. It connects southwestern Russia with regions to the north. Rostov-on-Don is an important river port both for people and industrial shipping. With such a good geographical location, the city grew quickly. It is the most industrialized city of South Russia. Because of this, the city caused a large problem between the Whites and the Bolsheviks during the Civil War. By 1928, the regional government was moved from the old Cossack capital Novocherkassk to Rostov. The nearby Armenian town of Nor Nakhijevan became a part of the city.

In the Soviet years, the Bolsheviks destroyed two of Rostov's main landmarks - St Alexander Nevsky Cathedral (1908) and St George Cathedral in Nakhichevan (1783-1807). Much of the city was destroyed by the German forces who took control of it three times - in 1918, 1941 and 1942. Today, the most notable part of the historical city is the very big Cathedral of Virgin's Nativity (1860-87), designed by Konstantin Thon.

The city was also the home of Russia's most well known serial killer Andrei Chikatilo but he was not actually born there.

Rostov-on-Don has had much economic growth in recent years. Part of this is because the Russian economy is getting stronger. Many new companies have built headquarters in the city. People living in the city are making more money than they did in the past. The city is being changed from a place thrown back in time by the collapse of communism into a modern, industrial and technology-rich city.

Public educational institutions include Southern Federal University and Don State Technical University. The major private university in the city is the Institute of Management, Business and Law. There is also a French cultural center, run by Alliance Francaise, a British-Council, a Goethe-Institut, and a Bosch Foundation.

Rostov Economic State University 'RINH' is a very famous university in Rostov-on-Don. It has 5 Institutes, as Finance, IT and Management, National and World Economics, Marketing and Commerce, Account and Economics, Law, Linguistics and Journalism and 9 filials.

Two professional football clubs are based in Rostov-on-Don. FC Rostov play in the Russian Premier League and SKA are in the First Division. Handball team Rostov-Don plays in the Russian Handball Championship.

The city is twinned with:

Internet forum

An Internet forum is a place on the Internet where people can type messages on a board for others to see. Messages or posts are organised by topic (or "thread"), with each poster either replying to an existing topic or creating a new topic for a new conversation.

Internet forums, sometimes called "forums", can be found on a lot of websites. Internet forums are often used to show people information. Things like pictures hyperlinks and images can also be put on the board, or "posted".

Many Internet forums have rules against things such as spamming and trolling. If people do those kind of things, they will be warned, and if they continue, they will be banned.

There are usually three different types of rankings on a forum:

Stone tools are tools made of stone that were used most commonly by cavemen, or people who lived in prehistoric times. Stone tools are not used very often anymore because tools made of materials such as iron or steel are better because they are stronger and last longer.

<doc id="99041" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99041" title="WWE Heat">
WWE Heat

WWE Heat was a professional wrestling show made by the World Wrestling Entertainment. 

During its televised history in the United States it was shown on the USA Network, MTV and Spike TV.

From 2005 to 2008 it was streamed on WWE.com on Fridays for North American viewers. However it was still televised in internationally. The final episode was streamed on May 30, 2008.

Internationally it was replaced by WWE Vintage Collection a program which featured matches from past WWE events and hosted by WWE 2006 Hall of Fame inductee "Mean" Gene Okerlund.

The show made its debut on August 2, 1998 on the USA Network as "WWF Sunday Night Heat". It began as the second most important show in WWF Programming second to "WWF Monday Night Raw". "Heat" would feature backstage interview segments and in-ring action. Main event stars such as The Rock, Mankind and Triple H would appear often to help further the storylines which occurred on "Monday Night Raw". "Heat" itself lead to a big ratings draw for the USA Network.

When "SmackDown!" was created in 1999, "Heat"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s importance lowered as well as ratings. With the debut of "SmackDown!" it lead to "Heat" being taped before "SmackDown!". When "SmackDown!" debuted in August 1999 it briefly became a recap show, with exclusive interviews and feuds from the past of WWF Programming being made into music videos. This only lasted a couple of weeks as it returned to airing exclusive matches.

The WWF also aired two "Halftime HEAT" television specials which aired during Super Bowl XXXIII on the USA Network. During this period the show moved to MTV as part of a deal between Viacom and the WWE. When the show moved to MTV it began broadcasting live from WWF New York.

In 2002 the show reverted to its previous format of taping the matches before "Raw". Since the brand extension in 2002 "Heat" became exclusive to the "Raw" brand, the only exception to this was pay-per-view nights which were broadcast live from the PPV venues and could involve wrestlers from the "SmackDown!" brand.

In 2002 "SmackDown!" branched off its own secondary show called "Velocity" which mirrored the same format as "Heat".

"Heat" and "Velocity" were not picked up by the USA Network, when WWE moved "Raw" back to the USA Network in October 2005. This left Americans no way of watching the weekend programmes on Television. WWE then made a decision to begin streaming these programmes on WWE.com exclusively for the United States audience. "Sunday Night Heat" soon was renamed "WWE Heat" as it no longer aired on Sundays.

"Heat" was still broadcast internationally due to previous programme commitments. For a short time a special 30 minute live edition of "Heat" began airing in place of the traditional pre-taped Free For All PPV pre-show. This lasted from No Mercy 2005 to Backlash 2006.

When WWE began airing in high definition "Heat" began using the same set as "Raw", "SmackDown!" and "ECW".

The final episode was streamed on WWE.com on May 30, 2008, and was replaced internationally by "WWE Vintage Collection".

She has been given the Orissa Sahitya Academy Award (1993), the Jhankar Award (1992), the Bhubaneswar Book Fair Award and the Prajatantra Award. 

Sahoo was born in a small town of Dhenkanal in Orissa (India). Sarojini has MA and PhD degrees in Oriya Literature and a Bachelor of Law from Utkal University. She now teaches at a degree college in Belpahar, Jharsuguda, Orissa. 

Sarojini is the second daughter of Ishwar Chandra Sahoo and (late) Nalini Devi. She is married to Jagadish Mohanty, a veteran writer of Orissa. They have a son and a daughter.

She has published ten anthologies of short stories.
Her English anthologies of short stories are :


Her other Oriya anthologies of short stories are: 

She has been widely translated and published in different Indian languages. Her stories have been included in anthologies published by "Harper Collins" , "National Book Trust" , "Sahitya Akademi" and "Gnanpith" . She has attended many All India Writer’s meet and workshops arranged by Bharat Bhawan, Bhopal, Sahitya Akademi and National Book Trust.

She has been given the Orissa Sahitya Akademi Award and Bhubaneswar Book Fair award for her short stories collection "Amrutara Pratikshare".

Seven novels are published so far: 

The novel "Upanibesh" was the first attempt in Oriya Literature to focus the sexuality as a part of social revolt by any woman. Medha, the protagonist of Sarojini’s novel, was a bohemian. In her pre-marital stage, she was thinking that it was boring to live with a man life-long. 

In her novel "Pratibandi", Sarojini has also described the thematic development of sexuality in a woman. Priyanka, the protagonist of the novel has to encounter the loneliness in the exile of Saragpali, a remote village of India. This lonliness develops into a sexual urge and soon Priyanka finds herself sexually attached with a former Member of Parliament. Though there is an age gap between them, his intelligence impresses her and she discovers a hidden archaeologist in him. Sarojini has painted successfully the difference of sensibility towards sexuality among male and female. Sarojini has her own credibility for the frankness to deals with the sensitive matters either it may be in politics or in sexuality. She has gained a reputation and has her own place in the history of Oriya fiction.
Her novel "Gambhiri Ghara" she describes an unusual relationship between two people, a Hindu house wife of India and a Muslim artist of Pakistan. It is a net oriented novel. A woman meets a very sexually experienced man. One day he asks if she had any such experience. The woman, Kuki, scolds him and insults him by calling him a caterpillar. She said without love lust is like hunger of a caterpillar. Gradually they become involved with love, lust and spiritually. That man considers her as his daughter, lover, mother, and above all these as a Goddess. They both madly love each other, through the internet and on the phone. They use obscene language; they kiss each other online. Kuki does not lead a happy conjugal life though she has a love marriage with Aniket. The novel is not limited to only a love story. It has a greater aspect. It deals with the relationship between State and individual. Safique, who is not a Muslim by temperament, and as a historian, thinks the Pakistan of today has separated itself from its roots and looks towards Arabian legends for his history. He protests that the syllabus of history for the school would start from seventh century AD, not from the Mahenjodaro and Harappa. This broad Safique was once arrested after the bomb blast of London for allegation of being associated with the terrorist. But is it a true fact? Later Kuki came to know that Safiques is trapped by a military junta. The ex-lover of Tabassum had revenged on Safique by arresting him with an allegation of terrorism.

Her novel "Gambhiri Ghara" proved to be a bestseller in Oriya literature. Her novels have gained a reputation for the frankness about sexuality and of feminist outlook. Her novels have gained a reputation for their feminist outlook and sexual frankness and has been translated into English and published from India under the title ,The Dark Abode (2008) ( ISBN : 978-81-906956-2-6 ) and published from Bangladesh in Bengali as Mithya Gerosthali.

Eddie Guerrero

Eduardo "Eddie" Gory Guerrero Yañez (October 9 1967 – November 13 2005) better known as Eddie Guerrero, was an American professional wrestler from a legendary Mexican wrestling family. He wrestled in Mexico, Japan, Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and, most famously, in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).

He started his wrestling career in 1987 in the Mexican Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre promotion. He became a star in Mexico long before he wrestled in the United States. In 1993, Guerrero began wrestling in Japan for New Japan Pro Wrestling, as Black Tiger II. He was one of the best Mexican wrestlers there are in the world and he made so many accomplishments through out his life time. He won the NJPW Junior Heavyweight Super Grade Tag League Championship with The Great Sasuke making him the most successful Black Tiger. He also won the Best of the Super Juniors 1996 tournament of junior heavyweights. He got a shot at the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion The Great Sasuke at NJPW Skydiving J but lost the match.

Guerrero’s first break came in late 1994 when the owner of Extreme Championship Wrestling, Paul Heyman, noticed him and Art Barr. Barr died before he could join ECW with Guerrero. In honor of his fallen friend, Guerrero did his finishing move, the Frog Splash.
Eddie started wrestling for the WCW in late 1995 along with Dean Malenko and Chris Benoit, with whom he had worked in NJPW and ECW. At World War 3 he competed in the 3-ring, 60-man World War 3 battle royal for the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Guerrero was one of the final 10 men in the battle royal, but was tossed out of the ring by Four Horsemen members. Randy Savage won the match. At Starrcade 1995, Guerrero represented WCW in a WCW vs. NJPW World Cup tournament series. He fell to NJPW wrestler Shinjiro Ohtani in the match but WCW went on to win the series.

Despite Guerrero's success and popularity, he had been one of many wrestlers that were upset at never being given a chance to be main event stars in WCW. Guerrero responded to Bischoff's actions by forming the Latino World Order (or LWO) with Hector Garza and Damien, a take-off on Bischoff's New World Order. with Hector Garza and Damien. 

On August 1, 2002, Guerrero began to wrestle for WWE's SmackDown! brand Guerrero aligned himself with his nephew Chavo, forming the tag team Los Guerreros. At Survivor Series 2002, Guerreros faced the tag team champions Edge and Rey Mysterio, and Angle and Benoit for the titles. Eddie made Mysterio submit to The Lasso From El Paso to win their first WWE Tag Team Championship. 

During the summer of 2003, Guerrero had begun driving a lowrider to ringside. Guerrero would also capitalize on his "Lie, Cheat, and Steal" anti-hero image by using illegal tactics behind the referee's back to win matches. This caused his increase popularity to rise.
On January 29, 2004 Eddie won SmackDown’s! 15-man Royal Rumble, earning a shot at the WWE Championship At No Way Out 2004, Guerrero defeated the WWE Champion Brock Lesnar in the main event with help from Goldberg at WrestleMania XX he kept his title by beating Kurt Angle.

President of the Confederation

The President of the Confederation leads meetings of the federal government (the Federal Council) of Switzerland.

Under the Swiss constitution of 1999, the Federal Council is the "highest executive authority". Although the president of the confederation has some extra duties to represent Switzerland, he is not the head of state.

All decisions are that a head of state would make are decided by a meeting of the Federal Council. For example, treaties are signed on behalf of the Federal Council, and all members of the federal council sign the "letters of credence" to introduce ambassadors sent by Switzerland to a foreign country. All ambassadors sent by a foreign country to Switzerland meet all of the members of the Federal Council, not just the President. 

The President of the Confederation is sometimes called the "primus inter pares" (first equal) in the Federal Council.

Only three other countries in the world do not have one person as a head of state, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Andorra and San Marino.

<doc id="99068" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99068" title="Nabta Playa">
Nabta Playa

Nabta Playa was once a large basin in the Nubian Desert. It is about 500 miles south of modern day Cairo or about 100 kilometers west of Abu Simbel of southern Egypt, 22° 32' north, 30° 42' east. Many archaeological sites have been found there.

From around the 10th millennium BC, this area began to get more rainfall than before. Because of the extra rainwater, a lake formed. Early people may have come here because there was water available. They could only graze their cattle where there was grass, and grass only grew next to water.

Archaeologists (scientists who find and study artifacts) say that the first people came to the region between the 10th and 8th millennia BC. These peoples were growing domesticated cattle and using ceramic pottery. The ceramics had complicated painted patterns on them. These patterns may have been made by using combs.

By the 7th millennium BC, more developed settlements may be found in the area. They also used deep wells for water. Huts are found built in straight rows. People also lived from fruit, legumes, millets, sorghum and tubers. 

A little later in 7th millennium BC, there seem to have been more goats and sheep. These most likely came from Southwest Asia . There were also many large hearths at this time.

Archaeological findings show that these prehistoric peoples led livelihoods seemingly at a higher level of organization than those who came after them, who lived closer to the Nile Valley:
Findings also show that the region was occupied only seasonally. This means that people only lived there in the summer, when the local lake filled with water for grazing cattle. Analysis of human remains show that the people who lived here may have migrated from sub-Saharan Africa.

By the 6th millennium BC, there may have been a prehistoric religion or cult. Sacrificed cattle were found buried in stone-roofed chambers lined with clay. Some people think that this cattle cult in Nabta Playa may be related to Ancient Egypt's Hathor cult. An example of this connection may be that Hathor was worshiped as a nighttime protector in desert regions.

Though the religious practices of the region involving cattle show possible ties to Ancient Egypt, Egyptologist Mark Lehner says:

This basically means that though there is evidence, there is no direct proof showing that the cattle cult was connected to Hathor.

By the 5th millennium BC these peoples had fashioned one of the world's earliest known astronomical device (roughly contemporary to the Goseck circle in Germany), about 1000 years older than but comparable to Stonehenge (see sketch at right). Research suggests that it may have been a prehistoric calendar which accurately marks the summer solstice.

The research done by the astrophysicist Thomas G. Brophy suggests that these monoliths might tell much more. The calendar circle itself is made up of one doorway that runs north-south, a second that runs northeast-southwest marking the summer solstice, and six center stones. Brophy's theory proposes first that three of the center stones match the belt of Orion at its minimum tilt and the other three match the shoulder and head stars of Orion at their maximum tilt. This cycle repeats approximately every 25,000 years, following the precession of the equinoxes. The last minimum of Orion's belt occurred between 6400 BC and 4900 BC, matching the radio-carbon dating of campfires around the circle..

The stone circle at Nabta Playa is built precisely on what was then the Tropic of Cancer, the sun's farthest North point of travel that is, today, about 23 degrees 40 minutes N. Such a site would interest the wise men of the megalithic era and some would travel many days to erect such a site and then study there.

Another stone megalithic structure exists which consists of a central radial stone and several other stones in the distance. In interpreting this Brophy found that the lines made to these stones from the radial stone match the spots in the sky where the various stars marked by the center stones in the calendar circle at the time they rose as the vernal equinox heliacal rising. In analyzing the varying distances, mulling through assumptions such as that they represented the brightness of the stars, he inadvertently found that they matched the distance of the stars from Earth on a scale of 1 meter = .799 light years within the margin of error for astronomical distances calculated today..

Video card

In computing, a video card (also called a graphics card or a graphics accelerator) is a special circuit board that controls what is shown on a computer monitor and calculates 3D images and graphics. 

A video card can handle two types of video images. First, they can be used to display a two-dimensional (2D) image like a Windows desktop, or a three-dimensional (3D) image like a computer game. Computer-Assisted Drawing (CAD) programs are often used by architects and designers to create 3D models on their computers. If a computer has a very fast video card, the architect can create very detailed 3D models.

Many computers have a basic video and graphics capabilities built-in to the computer's motherboard. These "onboard" video chips are not as fast as normal graphics cards. They are fast enough for basic computer use and even some basic computer games. If a computer user wants faster and more detailed graphics, a video card can be installed.

Video cards have their own processor (called a Graphics Processing Unit or GPU). The GPU separate from the main computer processor (called the Central Processing Unit or CPU). The CPU's job is to process all the calculations needed to make the computer function. The GPU's job is to handle 3D graphics calculations so the CPU does not have to. 3D graphics calculations take a lot of CPU power, so having a video card to handle the graphics calculations lets the CPU focus on other things like running computer programs. 

Video cards also have their own memory, separate from the main computer memory. It is usually much faster than main computer memory, too. This helps the GPU do its graphics calculations even faster. Most video cards also allow more than one monitor to be plugged in at one time. This lets the computer user use more than one monitor at once. Graphics manufacturers nVidia and ATI have special technologies that allow two identical cards to be linked together in a single computer for much faster performance. nVidia calls their technology SLI and ATI calls their technology CrossFire. Some modern graphics cards can even process physics calculations to create even more realistic-looking 3D worlds.

Video cards typically connect to a motherboard using the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI), the Advanced Graphics Port (AGP) or the Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCI Express or PCI-E). PCI-E is the newest and fastest connection; most (if not all) new video cards and motherboards have this connection. Before PCI-E was used, AGP was the standard connection for video cards. Before AGP, video cards were designed for PCI (sometimes called "regular" PCI). 

In early computing years, graphics processing was very basic and could be done by the CPU along with all the other processing. However, as computer games advanced and started using 3D graphics, the CPU had too much to do and CPU-makers could not keep up on making them faster. Eventually, video cards were invented to solve this problem. Video cards are designed to have their own processor called the Graphics Processing Unit or GPU. This lets the CPU do more work since it does not have to spend any time on advanced graphics calculations; it can simply pass these calculations off to the GPU to be done.

The first video cards connected to the motherboard via the ISA connection. The first popular non-IBM video cards were manufactured by a company called Hercules Computer Technology, Inc. Throughout the years, the importance of video cards has grown. As they evolved, a new connection standard was developed called Advanced Graphics Port (AGP). This was the first motherboard connection designed exclusively for video cards. It was much faster at transferring information between the video card and the rest of the computer. Eventually, the AGP connection became outdated, and a new connection, called PCI Express (PCI-E), became the standard for video cards. Most video cards manufactured today use PCI-E to connect to the motherboard.

Santa Cruz de Barahona

The Dominican city of Santa Cruz de Barahona, or simply Barahona, is the head municipality of the Barahona province, on the southwest of the country.

It is the largest city of the Dominican southwest and the centre of the region.

The municipality had, in 2002, a total population of 77,698: 38,093 men and 39,605 women. The urban population was 96.76% of the total population, one of the most urban municipality in the country. In this numbers are included the population of the municipal districts La Guázara and Villa Central. The population of Santa Cruz de Barahona without those municipal districts was 72,924.

Since the 18th century, the region was occupied by fishermen and people that came here to cut trees. When Toussaint L'Ouverture took the eastern part of the Hispaniola island in the name of France, he gave the order to create the town of Barahona in 1802 as part of the Ozama Department. After the Independence in 1844, Barahona was a military post of the Azua Province.

In 1858, Barahona was elevated to the category of municipality. When the province was created in 1881, Barahona was made its head municipality.

The city of Santa Cruz de Barahona is in a plain along the coast but part of the municipality is on the mountains of Sierra de Bahoruco.

Barahona is at 200 km to the west of Santo Domingo. The average temperature in the city is 26.1 °C and the average rainfall is 1,071.3 mm and it rains in 78.9 days.

The limits of the municipality are the municipality of Fundación to the north, the Caribbean Sea to the east, the municipality of La Ciénaga to the south and the municipality of Cabral to the west.

Santa Cruz de Barahana has three municipal districts; these are: El Cachón, La Guázara and Villa Central.

The main economic activity of the province is agriculture; the main product in the municipality is a very good coffee ("Barahona Type Coffee"), grown in the mountains of Eastern Bahoruco.

There are also some important industries, mainly to produce textiles to send to other countries, and sugar in the "Ingenio Barahona" ("Barahona Sugar Factory").

There is a port in the city; it is used to send coffee and sugar to other countries.

Hello all,

On , brought up a valid point of discussion:
In my opinion, the idea of an Encyclopedia is to present the facts, or as close to the facts one can get. Regligion/Belief is something very personal. In this respect I think it is important that for the articles about religious communities, we always present both views. 

Thoughts? -- () 17:27, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

Why are updates for this page disabled? It can be a bit annoying going through all the blue links to find a specific red link. ( ▪ ) 11:50, 25 February 2008 (UTC)

"The language is designed to shape the thought processes of its users." | | 22:24, 26 February 2008 (UTC)

Wikipedia has hit 26,000 articles. Does anyone know which is the 26,000th article? ( ▪ ) 11:47, 27 February 2008 (UTC)

Earlier this week, since the talk about this topic was stunted, I decided to add 2 new templates to this site for use in the following pages:

and any others that you can think of. I would like to ask every user on here if they could start using them please, or if not, at least talk about it here. Thanks, 16:32, 27 February 2008 (UTC)

After what they wrote about us, isn't it time for us to write about them? The Guardian is really a shame! - 13:17, 28 February 2008 (UTC)

I have been having problems with my JS scripts on here. I would like to ask if anyone else on here are missing these as well? Thanks, 17:10, 29 February 2008 (UTC)

@Huji: The ones that aren't working in specific for me are: Hotcat.js and whackamole vandal by Pilotguy. 17:33, 1 March 2008 (UTC)

Any progress on fixing whackamole or suggestions for other options (besides doing it manually, which kinda stinks after having the tools)? · 17:52, 6 March 2008 (UTC)

When the use of complex diction is neccessary (as anything else would sound lacking or awkward), should we explain the word through parenthesis, commas, or neither? Or should that not be standardized? For example, the word "botanist" in the George Washington Carver article.-- 03:32, 1 March 2008 (UTC)

I'm not against having colorful or creative signatures, but a lot of these new signatures are too distracting and take too much space in the editing page. Especially anything that is over one line long. Anyone with similar sentiments? -- 04:50, 1 March 2008 (UTC)

What does HotCat.js do and how do you use it? () 20:30, 1 March 2008 (UTC)

I think there should be a page like there is on the English Wikipedia about talk pages (found since there is a page already on here and on the English Wikipedia. The only thing missing is on here. () 23:27, 1 March 2008 (UTC)

I wish to use AWB but can't find any registration page. Can I register here? ( ▪ ) 12:23, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

The final point I would like to bring up is the fact that I am giving everyone in this community this barnstar:

Hello all,

I just wanted to let you know that has been nominated for Bureaucrat; and have been nominated for CheckUser. If you are interested in voting or voicing your opiniion, please do that . -- () 11:38, 5 March 2008 (UTC)

If we want to use AWB on here do we still sign up on Regular En? If we sign up there do we say for Simple and do we need 500 edits in Simple or Regular to get AWB on here? () 23:06, 5 March 2008 (UTC)

I've tried to register for AWB over on en:WP and my request was declined because they don't accept registrations for other wikis. Dunno why they wouldn't let me use it when I have over 8k mainspace edits here... 20:28, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

Weord. Maybe we could check with them? I dunno. () 15:11, 8 March 2008 (UTC)

I have made a new wikiproject for because the most important articles on computer science are not very good. -- () 05:43, 6 March 2008 (UTC)

I notice in the right corner of the edit summary it says "editing help" instead of "changing help". I am concerned because there has been a consistancy, "New changes", "Change page", "Changing (article name here)". It would be shameful to have this little bump. -- () 03:19, 7 March 2008 (UTC)
Thanks, Oysterguitarist. -- () 03:35, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

I created a few new gadgets. You can start using any of them, by going to and choosing Gadgets tab and marking the ones you want to use. Feel free to ask for more! - 22:25, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

It seems a little tedious and a waste of space to upload the same image on the "Simple English" Wikipedia if it is already on the "English" Wikipedia. Is there a way I can display images from the English Wikipedia in a Simple English Wikipedia artical without re-uploading? () 21:55, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

Some users say we should not welcome users until they have edited. However, I disagree. I think users who are new and haven't edited yet should be welcomed with because it shows them what is going on, how to edit etc. I do not think they should be welcomed with if they haven't edited yet. What do you think? Otherwise, lets create a message specifically for non editing new users so they understand everything. I've seen new users who haven't edited and I think some are throw aways and some are users who didn't read the welcome/don't know what to do yet. After all, everyones a newbie sometime! Did you know how to do everything at first? () 03:55, 8 March 2008 (UTC)
We could add a welcome template to and not waste a ton of pages. 02:19, 9 March 2008 (UTC)

Italian Campaign (World War I)

The Italian campaign was a series of battles fought between Austria-Hungary and Italy. These battles happened in northern Italy between the years 1915 and 1918. 

Italy switched its allegiance during the war to join the side of the Allies. They hoped that by joining the Triple Entente, Italy would gain the province of Trento ("Trentino"), the port of Trieste, and the province of Bolzano-Bozen ("Alto Adige/Südtirol"), Istria, and Dalmatia.

Italy had hoped to begin the war with a surprise attack, which was to act quickly and capture several Austrian-held cities. However, the war in Italy soon turned to trench warfare, similar to the Western Front.

Chitral District

Chitral () is a district in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan that contains the town of Chitral. It has an area of 14,850 km² and a population of 318,689 at the 1998 Census, which had subsequently risen to about 378,000 people by 2004. It has one of the highest mountains of the world, Tirich Mir. It is the largest district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, covering an area of 14,850 sq. kilometres.

Chitral District is the most northerly district in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to the west and north is Afghanistan - in the north the Wakhan Corridor, a narrow strip claimed by Pakistan, it separates Pakistan from Central Asian Union. To the east of Chitral are the federally controlled Northern Areas of Pakistan-administered Kashmir and to the south are the Pakistani internal districts of Upper Dir and Swat. Chitral can be accessed by air via the Chitral Airport which is approximately 3 km from the town. Regular flights from Peshawar and Islamabad are run by the PIA.

The terrain of Chitral is quite mountainous, part of the Pamir Mountains are situated here. Tirich Mir which at 25,289 feet (7,708 metres) is the highest peak of the Hindu Kush, rises in the north of the district.

Chitral is connected to the rest of Pakistan by only two road routes, the Lowari Pass (el. 10,230 ft.) from Dir and Shandur Top (el. 12,200 ft.) from Gilgit. Both routes are closed in winter. The Lowari Tunnel is being constructed under the Lowari Pass.

It was reported in 2004 that Afghanistan had agreed to allow access from Pakistan to Chitral though Afghan territory and the Kunar Valley, by passing Lowari Pass.

Two other passes give access on foot to Chitral, the Broghol Pass and the Dorah Pass, both from Afghanistan. Both are closed in winter.

The general population is mainly of the Kho people, who speak the Khowar language (or Chitrali), which is also spoken in parts of Yasin, Gilgit and Swat. Chitral is also home to the Kalash tribe who reside in three remote valleys southwest of Chitral town.

The Norwegian linguist Georg Morgenstierne wrote that Chitral is the area of the greatest linguistic diversity in the world. Although Khowar is the predominant language of Chitral, more than ten other languages are spoken here. These include Kalasha-mun, Palula, Dameli, Gawar-Bati, Nuristani, Yidgha, Burushaski, Gujar, Wakhi, Kyrgyz, Persian and Pashto. Since many of these languages have no written form, letters are usually written in Urdu or Persian.
Osama bin Laden is thought to be hiding in this district, according to the New York Post.

Until 1969, Chitral was a princely state, within the Malakand Agency. In 1970 Chitral was absorbed into Pakistan as the new Chitral District, until 2000 within Malakand Division.

The district of Chitral is divided into six tehsils 


The district is represented in the provincial assembly by two elected MPAs who represent the following constituencies:

Union Councils of Pakistan

A Union Council or Village Council in Pakistan is an elected local government body that has 21 councillors - who are elected by the people. Each Union Council is headed by a Nazim which is similar to a mayor and a Naib Nazim (similar to a deputy mayor).

Union Councils are the fifth level (the lowest level) of government in Pakistan. Union Councils are often known as "Village Councils" in rural areas, the area represented by a Village Council usually comprises a large village and surrounding areas, often including nearby small villages. The term "Union Council" may be used for areas that are part of cities.

Each Union Council is governed by a Union Nazim (similar to a mayor), each union council has 13 elected members known as councillors. As well as four male and two female members elected directly, there are two male and two female representatives of the labour, a minority member, a Union Nazim and his deputy known as Union Naib Nazim. 

Also as well as the elected members, there are several government employees and functionaries in every union council, who report to the Secretary of the Union Council. The last one is a civil servant appointed by the state. 

The territory of a Union Council or Village Council is usually part of a tehsil, (a tehsil is a district subdivision). Less commonly, a Union Council may be part of a City District.

Shown below is a simplified structure of the political hierarchy, the federal government governs the provinces (allocation of resources and policy decisions), the provinces govern the districts etc , the union councils are involved directly in local government administration.

Christopher Lee

Sir Christopher Frank Carandini Lee, CBE , CStJ, (born 27 May 1922) is an English actor. He is best known for his many movie characters. For example, Dracula and Fu Manchu in many movies during the 1950s through the 1970s as well as Saruman the White in "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy and Count Dooku in "". 

Lee was born in London, England. He and his older sister Xandra were raised by Estelle Marie and Geoffrey Trollope until their divorce in 1926. Trollope was a professional soldier. Later, while Lee was still a child, his mother married (and later divorced) Harcourt George "Ingle" St. Croix, a banker. Lee studied at Wellington College from age 14 to 17. After this, he worked as an office clerk in a couple of London shipping companies. In 1941, he enlisted in the RAF during World War II. After military service, Lee joined the Rank Organisation in 1947. He trained as an actor in their "Charm School". He played many small parts in movies, for example, "Corridor of Mirrors" (1948). He had a small part in Laurence Olivier's "Hamlet" (1948). Peter Cushing was also in this movie. Lee and Cushing also both acted in "Moulin Rouge" (1952) but did not meet until later when they did horror movies together. They are well known for working together in horror movies. 

Lee had many parts in movies and television during the 1950s. He did not become famous until he started working with Hammer Film Productions. With Hammer Films, he acted in "The Curse of Frankenstein" (1957), "Dracula" (1958), "The Mummy" (1959), and "The Hound of the Baskervilles" (1959). All of these movies also starred Cushing. Lee continued his role as "Dracula" in many Hammer sequels during the 1960s and early 1970s. During this time, he acted many times as Fu Manchu. The most notable was in the first of the series "The Face of Fu Manchu" (1965). He also acted in many movies in Europe. With his own production company, Charlemagne Productions, Ltd., Lee made "Nothing But the Night" (1972) and "To the Devil a Daughter" (1976). By the mid-1970s, Lee wanted to stop making horror movies. He acted in several mainstream movies, for example "The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes" (1970), "The Three Musketeers" (1973), "The Four Musketeers" (1974), and the James Bond movie "The Man with the Golden Gun" (1974).

Because these movies were very well liked, he chose to move to Hollywood in the mid-1970s. He was a busy actor but most of the work he did for movies and television was not very notable. Because of this, he decided moved back to England. Lee's career became very notable again in the early 2000s. His acting in "The Lord of the Rings" movie trilogy (2001-2003) (as Saruman the White) and "" (2002) (as Count Dooku) caused this. In 2001, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his contributions to the movie and television industries.

Liv Tyler

Liv Tyler (born July 1, 1977) is an American actress and model. She is best known for her roles of Grace Stamper in "Armageddon" and Arwen in "The Lord of the Rings" movie trilogy. She is the daughter of Aerosmith's frontman, Steven Tyler.

Tyler was born Liv Rundgren at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, New York. She is the first born daughter of Bebe Buell, a model, singer, and was the Playboy Playmate of the month Miss November 1974, and Steven Tyler, the lead singer of Aerosmith. Her maternal grandmother, Dorothea Johnson, founded the Protocol School of Washington. Her mother named her after Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann. At birth, Bebe Buell claimed that rock star Todd Rundgren was Tyler's biological father. Tyler spent most of her childhood living with that understanding, only finding her true parentage at age nine, after meeting Steven Tyler at a Rundgren concert in Boston. Also, when Tyler was growing up, Steven Tyler started coming to visit. Then at another meeting in 1988, seeing that Steven Tyler's other daughter, Mia, looked very similar to herself, she asked her mother. The truth about Tyler's paternity did not become public until 1991, when she changed her name from Rundgren to Tyler, but kept the old one as a middle name. Buell's reason for the decision was that Steven Tyler was too heavily addicted to drugs at that time. Since knowing the truth about her paternity, Liv and Steven Tyler have had a close relationship. They have even made their careers intertwine when Liv performed in Aerosmith's video "Crazy" and when Aerosmith wrote and performed many of the songs in Liv's film "Armageddon".

Tyler went to the Congressional School of Virginia, Breakwater Elementary and Wayneflete schools (in Portland, Maine) before returning to New York City with her mother at the age of twelve. She went to York Prep in NYC for Junior High and High School, graduating in 1995. One month later Tyler set off for Italy, to star in "Stealing Beauty".

Carlo Gesualdo

Carlo Gesualdo, known as Gesualdo da Venosa (born probably 8 March 1566; died 8 September 1613), Prince of Venosa and Count of Conza, was an Italian music composer, lutenist and murderer. He lived in the late part of the Renaissance period. He is famous for his beautifully expressive madrigals which are written in a very chromatic style (using lots of sharps and flats). He is also remembered for committing a horrible murder.

Gesualdo came from an aristocratic family. He was probably born at Venosa, but we know hardly anything about his early life. We know that he was extremely interested in music when he was small and showed very little interest in anything else. He played the lute, harpsichord and guitar.

In 1586 Gesualdo married his first cousin, Donna Maria d'Avalos, the daughter of the Marquis of Pescara. Two years later she began to have a love affair with Fabrizio Carafa, the Duke of Andria. For two years her husband knew nothing about her love affair. Then one day he returned unexpectedly to his palace (he may have suspected that something was happening) and found them making love. He murdered them both in their bed. He then left their bodies in front of the palace for everyone to see. In those days in Italy a nobleman could not be arrested and punished. However, someone might have wanted to kill him in revenge, so he ran away to the town of Gesualdo where he had a castle.

A lot of people heard about the murders. Famous poets such as Tasso wrote poems about it. Nothing was done to arrest Gesualdo, however. Some people at the time said that he also murdered one of Maria’s babies because he thought he might not have been the father. Other people even said that he murdered his father-in-law when he came wanting to kill him in revenge, but we do not know whether this was true.

In 1594 Gesualdo went to the town of Ferrara which was famous for music which was being composed by modern composers experimenting with new ideas. He spent two years there and composed his first book of madrigals. There he married another woman who was a niece of Duke Alfonso II d’Este. The couple moved back to Gesualdo in 1597.

After returning to his castle at Gesualdo from Ferrara in 1595, he tried to make the town famous for music. He invited some of Italy’s most famous musicians to come and work for him. Since he was very rich he could afford to do this. However, the music making only took place in his castle. Gesualdo spent the last years of his life doing nothing except music. He hardly ever left his castle. 

Gesualdo’s new marriage was not a happy one. His wife said he was cruel and she tried to divorce him. She spent a lot of time away from the castle and wrote him angry letters.

Late in life he suffered from depression and madness. We do not know whether this was because he felt bad about being a murderer, but he probably did feel guilty. He often made his servants hit him. He also wrote very strange letters to a cardinal asking him to send him some of his dead uncle’s skeleton because he thought these remains would make him better.

Gesualdo died alone at his castle. The chapel where he was buried was destroyed by an earthquake in 1688. There is still a burial plaque in the rebuilt church.

We think it is likely that Gesualdo felt terribly guilt all his life about the murders he had committed, and these guilty feelings can be heard in his music. The words of his madrigals are often very emotional: they are about "love", "pain", "death", "ecstasy", "agony". Of course, other madrigal composers used such words, but Gesualdo’s music is really extreme. It is often wildly chromatic. Other composers did not copy his style.

He wrote both sacred (religious) and secular (non-religious) songs, and some music for instruments. His most famous compositions are his six published books of madrigals (between 1594 and 1611), as well as his "Tenebrae Responsories", which are very much like madrigals, except that they use texts from the Passion story about Christ’s death on the cross.

Conflict

A conflict is a struggle between people. The struggle may be physical, or between conflicting ideas. The word comes from Latin "conflingere" Conflingere means "to come together for a battle". Conflicts can either be within one person, or they can involve several people or groups. Conflicts arise because there are needs, values or ideas that are seen to be different, and there is no means to reconcile the dispute. 

Very often, conflicts lead to fights, or even wars (in the case where conflicts are solved with weapons). Conflict between ideas is usually fought with propaganda.
Types of conflict are: Character Vs. Character, Character Vs. Society, Character Vs. self, and Character Vs. Machine.

Constructed script

A constructed script (also artificial script, neography, and conscript for short) is a kind of writing system. It is a writing system that is specifically created by an individual or group, and is not like an evolved natural script. In contrast, natural scripts evolve and grow as part of a natural language or culture.

Some constructed scripts are made to be used for constructed languages. Other constructed scripts are used in linguistic experimentation or for other more practical uses in existing languages.

An Inspector Calls

An Inspector Calls is a play written in 1945 by the British playwright J. B. Priestley, but set in 1912. It was first performed in 1946 in two Moscow theatres as no London theatres were available. It was then first produced in London at the New Theatre on 1 October 1946. It shows the way in which people are all connected, and reflects Priestley's socialist views whilst outlining the problems he saw with capitalism. 

J.B Priestley uses dramatic devices and dramatic irony to signal characters and introduce the inspector. For example the house is pink and intimate while they are celebrating the engagement but when the sharp ring of a door bell the lighting changes to brighter and harder. Some believe that it represents an interrogation room due to the bright lights that are shining on the Birlings as then the inspector come in and picks the story out of them bit by bit.
Dramatic Irony is used throughout the play to create prejudice between Mr Birling and the audience.

Justice and Equality Movement

The Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) is a rebel group involved in the Darfur conflict of Sudan. It is led by Khalil Ibrahim. Together with other rebel groups such as the Sudan Liberation Army, they are fighting against the government-supported Janjaweed militia. The JEM is also a member of the Eastern Front, a rebel coalition. After the Eastern Front signed a peace deal with the central government, the JEM lost access to its funding from Eritrea.

The JEM traces its foundation to the writers of the "", a manuscript published in 2000 that shows some problems. JEM has an Islamist ideology, and the government links the group to Hassan al-Turabi, although leaders of the group and Turabi himself deny the claim. However, al-Turabi blames the government for making the situation worse". 

On January 20, 2006, the group merged with the Sudan Liberation Movement, along with other rebel groups, to form the Alliance of Revolutionary Forces of West Sudan. However, the JEM and SLM negotiated as separate groups with peace talks with the government in May 2006.

In October of 2007, the JEM attacked an oilfield in the Kordofan region of Sudan. This olified is controlled by a Chinese consortium. The next month, a group of 135 Chinese engineers arrived in Darfur to work on this field. Ibrahim told reporters, "We oppose them coming because the Chinese are not interested in human rights. It is just interested in Sudan's resources." The JEM claims that the revenue from oil sold to China funds the Sudanese government and the Janjaweed militia.

On the morning of December 11th, 2007, Khalil Ibrahim claimed that JEM forces fought and defeated Sudanese government troops guarding a Chinese-run oilfield in the Kordofan region. Khartoum officials, however, denied that any oil fields had come under attack. Ibrahim said that the attack was part of a JEM campaign to rid Sudan of Chinese-run oilfields and stated that "[The JEM] want all Chinese companies to leave. They have been warned many times. They should not be there."

Middle-earth languages

This article is about the constructed languages of J. R. R. Tolkien, used in his Middle-earth universe.

J. R. R. Tolkien was a philologist, and he was interested in language since he was a child. He invented several languages, which he then used in his Middle-earth writings. Aside from the external history, most of his languages have also an invented "internal history". The internal history means how the languages evolved and were used inside the fictional story by the fictional people who spoke them. 
Some of Tolkien's languages have a detailed grammar and vocabulary. Other languages are not very detailed, and some languages have only a few words and names. Quenya and Sindarin are the best and most developed languages, while others like Rohirric, Khuzdûl, or Black Speech, are not as much developed.

Tolkien also created the Tengwar, Sarati, and Cirth scripts for his languages.

The Eldarin languages or Elvish languages are the languages of the Elves. At other times, Elvish languages were the common speech. Later the Elvish languages were also used by humans, especially by scientists and the nobility. The Eldarin languages can be divided into two groups: Quenya language and Telerin languages (which includes Telerin, Nandorin, and Sindarin).

Quenya is an Elvish language. It was spoken by the Vanyar and Noldor elves in Valinor. When the Noldor returned to Middle-earth in the First Age, they brought Quenya with them. But the native Sindarin became far more common in everyday speech. In the Second Age and especially in the Third Age, Quenya in Middle-earth was used more as a scientific and ritual language. Because of this Tolkien sometimes called Quenya the "Elf-Latin".

Telerin is an Elvish language. It was spoken by the Teleri elves. From Telerin developed several new languages and dialects, for example Sindarin.

Sindarin is an Elvish language. It came from the Telerin language. It was spoken by the Sindar (or Grey Elves) in Middle-earth. It later became the most common elvish language spoken in Middle-earth.

Adûnaic is the language of the people of Númenor. After the Fall of Númenor, Adûnaic was not often used anymore. From Adûnaic and the native languages of the western coastlands of Middle-earth developed Westron.

Westron (Westron: "Adûni", Sindarin: "Annúnaid"), or the Common Speech (Westron: "Sôval Phârë"), is a language of Middle-earth. It comes from Adûnaic and the natives languages of Middle-earth. In the Third Age, Westron is used as the common language, spoken by most peoples.
In the books, the text written in English is meant to be Westron most of the time.

Rohirric (also Rohirian or Rohanese) is the language of the Rohirrim of Rohan. In the books, Rohirric text and names are always represented by Old English. This is made because Rohirric should feel older but similar to the hobbit's Westron, and they are in the books represented by Old English and Modern English.

Khuzdûl is the language of the Dwarves. The dwarves keep much of what they do a secret, and they also do this with their language. Because of this, only a few place-names and phrases are known from Khuzdûl. Dwarves have never told other (non-dwarven) people their Khuzdûl names. Instead, they use other names when talking to the other peoples of Middle-earth. The dwarven "nicknames" that appear in the books are all taken from Norse mythology. 
Besides the spoken language, called "aglab", Khuzdûl had the "iglishmek", which was a sign language.

Entish is the language of the Ents. The language is, like the Ents themselves, very "unhasty": it takes a lot of time to say something. The language uses very long descriptions and many repetitions. Because it is so complicated and takes so much time, nobody but the Ents uses or can understand this language.

Valarin was the language spoken by the Ainur.

Black Speech is the language of Sauron. The language was created by him and used by his followers. The inscription on the One Ring was Black Speech, written in tengwar. Aside from the Ring-inscription, there are several names and words of Black Speech known.

Lope de Vega

Lope de Vega (also Félix Lope de Vega y Carpio or Lope Félix de Vega Carpio) (25 November 1562 – 27 August 1635) was a Spanish Baroque playwright and poet. His reputation in the world of Spanish letters is second only to that of Cervantes, while the sheer volume of his literary output is unequalled: 
he is estimated to have written between 1,500 and 2,500 fully-fledged plays – of which some 425 have survived until the modern day – together with a plethora of shorter dramatic and poetic works.

He was ""The Phoenix of Wits"" and ""Monster of Nature"" by Miguel de Cervantes because he did so much work. Lope de Vega renewed the Spanish theatre when people were becoming interested in it. Along with Calderón de la Barca and Tirso de Molina, he improved Spanish theater. He is considered a great dramatist and his plays are often performed. He is also one of the famous Spanish poets and authors.

Lope de Vega was born in Madrid to a non-notable family, who came to the capital from Valle de Carriedo in Cantabria recently. Félix de Vega, the bread winner of the family, was an embroiderer.

Pedro Calderón de la Barca y Henao (January 17, 1600 – May 25, 1681), was a dramatist of the Spanish Golden Age.

Calderón was born in Madrid. His mother, who was of Flemish descent, died in 1610; his father, who was secretary to the treasury, died in 1615. Calderón was educated at the Jesuit College in Madrid, the Colegio Imperial, with a view to taking orders; but instead, he studied law at Salamanca.

Chemical vapor deposition

Chemical vapor deposition is a method of putting a thin layer of a materials on to a surface using very low heat. It is specially useful for coating thin glass with metal without damaging the glass, using such a thin layer of metal that the glass can be seen through. This technology was invented by the Head of the Chemistry Department of Harvard University, Professor Roy Gordon, in the 1970s and perfected by his team during the 1980s. Chemical vapor deposition has a vast range of uses. Hip replacement joints are coated using chemical vapor deposition to make them lighter, stronger, and longer lasting. TFT displays (flat screen televisions and computer monitors) are made using chemical vapor deposition. This technology is also used to prevent double glazing windows and supermarket freezers from steaming up.

States of Sudan

Below is a list of the 25 states of Sudan. As Sudan was under British rule, they are organized by their original provinces under British rule. Arabic language versions are in parentheses. States that were not provinces before 1994 are marked with (*). Transliterations from Arabic to English may vary; in particular, the article "al" is sometimes transliterated as "el". Numbers correspond to those of the map at right.


Anglo-Egyptian Sudan had eight "mudiriyat", or provinces, which were ambiguous when created but became well defined by the beginning of the Second World War. The eight provinces were: Blue Nile, Darfur, Equatoria, Kassala, Khartoum, Kurdufan, Northern, and Upper Nile. In 1948 Bahr al Ghazal split from Equatoria. 

There were numerous new provinces created on 1 July 1973. North and South Darfur were created from Darfur, while Kurdufan divided into North and South Kurdufan. Al Jazirah and White Nile were split off from Blue Nile. River Nile split off from Northern. Red Sea was split off from Kassala.

A further fracturing of provinces occurred in 1976. Lakes split from Bahr al Ghazal, and Jonglei split off from Upper Nile. Equatoria divided into East and West Equatoria. There were thus eighteen provinces. In 1991, the government reorganized the administrative regions into nine federal states, matching the nine provinces that had existed from 1948 to 1973. On 14 February 1994, the government reorganized yet again, creating twenty-six "wilayat" (states). The majority of the wilayat were either the old provinces or administrative subregions of a province. As part of the new government structure in South Sudan in 2005, Bahr al Jabal was renamed Central Equatoria. In 2006, West Kurdufan was split and merged with North Kurdufan and South Kurdufan.

<doc id="99318" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99318" title="WrestleMania XXIV">
WrestleMania XXIV

WrestleMania XXIV was the twenty-fourth yearly WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view event made by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It took place on March 30, 2008 at the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, Florida. It was the first WrestleMania to be held in the state of Florida, and the second WrestleMania to be held outdoors the whole time, the other being WrestleMania IX. The official theme songs were ""Light It Up"" by Rev Theory and ""Snow ((Hey Oh))"" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The tagline was ""The Biggest WrestleMania Under the Sun"."

Tickets went on sale to the public on November 3 2007. For the second year in a row, WrestleMania broke the record for the highest-grossing pay-per-view in WWE history and for the Citrus Bowl, grossing in $5.85 million in ticket sales. The record-breaking Citrus Bowl attendance record of 74,635 consisting of people from twenty-one countries, all fifty states, and five Canadian provinces, pumped an estimated $30 million into the local economy. The Central Florida Sports Commission thought that the event created many jobs, and brought around 60,000 visitors to the city for the event. WWE and the city of Orlando hosted festivities that spanned a five-day period within the central Florida area, bringing many branding opportunities and television coverage, leading up to the event at the Citrus Bowl. 

The event was a joint-promotion pay-per-view, having performers from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands. The main match on the Raw brand was a Triple Threat match for the WWE Championship between Randy Orton, Triple H, and John Cena, which Orton won by pinning Cena. The main event and featured match on the SmackDown brand was Edge versus The Undertaker for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Undertaker won by forcing Edge to submit with the Gogoplata. The main match on the ECW brand was Chavo Guerrero against Kane for the ECW Championship, which Kane won by pinfall after performing a chokeslam. Main matches on the undercard included Floyd Mayweather, Jr. versus The Big Show in a No Disqualification match,<ref name="Mayweather/Show"></ref> an interpromotional Money in the Bank ladder match, and Ric Flair versus Shawn Michaels.

The main feud heading into WrestleMania on the Raw brand was between Randy Orton, John Cena, and Triple H, with the three feuding over the WWE Championship. At the Royal Rumble in January, John Cena won the Royal Rumble match by last eliminating Triple H to become the number one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania XXIV. Instead of challenging Randy Orton for the title at WrestleMania, he wanted to challenge him at No Way Out, the next pay-per-view. At No Way Out, Orton got himself intentionally disqualified by slapping the referee, thus keeping the WWE Championship. Also at No Way Out, Triple H became the new number one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania by winning against five other men in an Elimination Chamber match. The night after on "Raw", after Cena argued that he should have another WWE Championship match, Raw General Manager William Regal said that Cena would face Orton later in the night with the stipulation being if Cena won, he would be added to the WrestleMania match between Triple H and Orton, making it a Triple Threat match. If Orton won, however, the main event would stay as Orton versus Triple H. Cena won the match, pinning Orton after executing an FU. After the match, Triple H, who was the Special Guest referee, executed a Pedigree to both Cena and Orton.

The common feud on the SmackDown brand was between Edge and The Undertaker, with the two battling over the World Heavyweight Championship. On the February 29 version of "SmackDown", Assistant General Manager Theodore Long said that at No Way Out, an Elimination Chamber match would be held to find out who was the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania. Undertaker won the match, last eliminating Batista after executing a Tombstone piledriver.

At No Way Out, The Big Show made a surprise return to the company. In his return promo, Big Show threatened to give Rey Mysterio a Chokeslam. Professional boxer Floyd Mayweather, Jr., who was in attendance and a close friend of Mysterio's, came to his aid and confronted Big Show. Big Show then got on his knees to allow Mayweather to punch him, which Mayweather did, by hitting him with many different punches, which caused Big Show to bleed from the nose and mouth. The next night on "Raw", the Big Show challenged Mayweather to a match, which Mayweather accepted.
On the February 25 2008 edition of "Raw", 2008 WWE Hall of Fame Inductee Ric Flair challenged Shawn Michaels to a match at WrestleMania, which the latter accepted after some reluctance, knowing that Flair's career will be on the line. Flair also said that "it would be an honor for him to retire at the hands of Shawn Michaels."

Also, on the February 25 2008 edition of "Raw", the General Manager William Regal was "sent a letter" by the SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero, issuing a challenge to him for an interpromotional "Raw vs. SmackDown" match at WrestleMania XXIV, with each brand choosing one superstar to represent it. Regal accepted and chose Umaga to represent Raw at WrestleMania XXIV. On the February 29 version of "SmackDown", Batista was chosen as the SmackDown representative by Vickie Guerrero against Umaga at WrestleMania XXIV.

On February 18 2008 WWE said using its website that the fourth annual Money in the Bank ladder match would take place at WrestleMania XXIV, with superstars competing from Raw, SmackDown and ECW. The winner will get a contract to challenge for any of the three WWE World Championships (the WWE Championship of Raw, the World Heavyweight Championship of SmackDown, or the ECW Championship) at any time and any place over a one-year period. Qualifying matches were done to find out who were the participants in the match. Jeff Hardy was at first supposed to be a part of the Money in the Bank ladder match, but was excluded from the event due to his suspension. WWE decided not to fill his spot with another superstar, making this year's Money in the Bank ladder match the first year to only have 7 participants.

On the March 11 2008 version of "ECW", ECW General Manager Armando Estrada announced a twenty-four man battle royal at WrestleMania XXIV with the winner going on to face ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero for the ECW Championship following the battle royal. The first announced participant was The Great Khali. WrestleMania XXIV marks the first WrestleMania in which the ECW Championship will be defended. Big Daddy V was at first scheduled to take part in this match, but was removed for unknown reasons. Stevie Richards would also replace Matt Striker, for unknown reasons as well.


Before the show was first shown live on pay-per-view, Kane won a 24-man Interpromotional Battle Royal to win an ECW Championship match against Chavo Guerrero later that night. The event officially began with John Legend singing a rendition of ""America the Beautiful"." The first match that was shown live on pay-per-view was a Belfast Brawl between Finlay and John "Bradshaw" Layfield. Finlay was accompanied to the ring by his returning "son" Hornswoggle, who was injured at the hands of JBL a few weeks ago on "Raw".

The next match of the evening was the fourth-yearly Money in the Bank ladder match, featuring Chris Jericho, Mr. Kennedy and Carlito from the Raw brand; CM Punk, Shelton Benjamin and John Morrison from the ECW brand; and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) from the SmackDown brand. The match featured many dangerous spots. Early in the match, Morrison climbed a turnbuckle and performed a moonsault on others outside while holding a ladder against his chest. Then, at one point, when Mr. Kennedy and Morrison were battling on top of a ladder, Benjamin climbed another ladder placed adjacent to the first one, and performed a flip powerbomb on Kennedy, who in turn superplexed Morrison from the top of the ladder. After sometime, Kennedy delivered his Green Bay Plunge to Punk onto a ladder. Later, Carlito and Kennedy flipped Benjamin off a ladder, sending him crashing through another ladder set-up between the barricade and the ring apron. Jericho also performed his Walls of Jericho on Morrison on top of a ladder. Kennedy delivered his Mic Check to Punk off a ladder. Quickly afterwards, Carlito hit the Backstabber to Jericho from a ladder. When MVP was close of finding the contract briefcase, Matt Hardy returned to action through the crowd, entered the ring and delivered the Twist of Fate to MVP off the ladder. As soon as Morrison started to climb a ladder, see-sawing with another ladder, Jericho flipped the other one and Morrison landed on the ring-ropes groin-first. In the end, Jericho and Punk fought each other on a ladder, but Punk trapped Jericho's one leg in the ladder's steps and himself retrieved the contract briefcase to win the match.

The next match which was billed as a "Battle for Brand Supremacy", was between SmackDown's Batista and Raw's Umaga. Early in the match, both Batista and Umaga exchanged blows and Batista threw Umaga outside with a shoulder block. Umaga later delivered a high-impact kick to Batista, which caused him to fall back-first outside the ring from the ring-apron. Hence, Umaga started targeting Batista's injured back. But in the end, when Umaga tried to go for a Samoan Spike, Batista countered the attempt and delivered a spinebuster to Umaga. Batista won the match by pinning Umaga after hitting him with his Batista Bomb. The fourth match for the event featured Chavo Guerrero defending his ECW Championship against Kane. Kane surprised Chavo by emerging from underneath the ring instead of from the entrance stage. In the second shortest match in WrestleMania history, Kane instantly pinned Chavo after a Chokeslam and won the ECW Championship in eight seconds.
Ric Flair put his career on the line next against Shawn Michaels. At the start of the match, both superstars engaged in a series of counters, and then Flair shoved Michaels in a corner, making "Old Yeller" comments to him. In retaliation, Michaels slapped Flair in the face, which caused him to start bleeding from the mouth. Later, Flair performed a crossbody onto Michaels from the top rope for a two count. Then, in a very dangerous spot, when Flair was on the outside, Michaels performed an Asai moonsault onto Flair, but missed and landed hard on the Raw announcers' table rib-first. With Flair later on outside the ring again, Michaels successfully attempted another moonsault from the top-rope onto Flair. Back in the ring, Michaels tried to go for his Sweet Chin Music, but stopped in the process and Flair capitalized by trapping him in his figure four leglock. Afterwards, Michaels finally delivered a Sweet Chin Music to Flair, but the latter kicked out to the pinfall attempt. Michaels then, trapped Flair in his modified figure four leglock, but Flair delivered a thumb to the eye to Michaels to break the submission. As Flair was delivering chops to Michaels, the latter hit a second Sweet Chin Music. After getting up on his feet with a worried face, Michaels said to Flair "I'm sorry, I love you", before nailing a final Sweet Chin Music and thus pinning Flair to end his 36-year long wrestling career. After the match, Michaels left quickly and Flair got a standing ovation from the crowd. An emotional Flair embraced his family at ringside and then, as he proceeded to go backstage, thanked the crowd for their support.

The sixth match was the Playboy BunnyMania Lumberjack match, in which Maria and Ashley faced Beth Phoenix and Melina, who were accompanied to the ring by Santino Marella. Snoop Dogg served as the official "Master of Ceremonies" for this match. Due to some technical difficulties, the lights at Citrus Bowl temporarily went out during the match. Near the end, a pin attempt by Maria was prevented when Santino pulled Maria's leg. In response, Raw commentator Jerry Lawler approached and knocked Marella down with a punch. With a Fisherman suplex, Phoenix pinned Maria to win the match. After the match, Snoop Dogg clotheslined Marella in the ring and kissed Maria, before leaving with her and Ashley.

Randy Orton defended his WWE Championship against Triple H and John Cena in a Triple Threat match next. For his entrance, Cena had a marching band perform an instrumental version of his theme song ""The Time Is Now"" live. During the match, when Triple H had held Orton in a sleeper hold, Cena picked up both Orton and Triple H for an FU, but Triple H dropped down and low blowed him. Orton dominated the match for some time. One hightlight of the match featured Orton performing a crossbody from the top rope on Cena, while the latter was held on Triple H's shoulders in an electric chair position. Also, Orton delivered a double elevated DDT from the second rope to both Cena and Triple H simultaneously. Orton then tried to RKO Cena, but he countered and threw Orton onto Triple H. Then, Triple H started targeting Orton's legs and using some submissions on him. The match's finish came when Triple H countered Cena's FU into a Pedigree, but when he covered Cena, Orton punted on Triple H's head and himself pinned Cena to retain his WWE Championship.

The next match was the No Disqualification match between The Big Show and Floyd Mayweather, Jr.. Early in the match, Mayweather repeatedly escaped Big Show's grasp and delivered body shots to him. Soon, Mayweather put a sleeper hold on Big Show, but the latter escaped out of it before passing out and stomped on Mayweather's hand. Mayweather and his accomplices tried to "walk out" of the match, but Big Show walked up the ramp and brought Mayweather back in the ring. As Big Show was about to chokeslam Mayweather, one of Mayweather's accomplices struck a steel chair on Big Show's back, and the latter chokeslammed him in retaliation. Capitalizing from this distraction, Mayweather grabbed that chair and hit Big Show multiple times on the head with it. Finally, Mayweather removed his right glove and put on a pair of brass knuckles to hit Big Show in the face. Thus, Big Show was knocked out as he could not answer the referee's ten count and Mayweather was declared the winner.

The main event and last match of the night was Edge putting his World Heavyweight Championship on the line against the number one contender The Undertaker.

As the second WrestleMania to be held outdoors the whole time, WWE chairman Vince McMahon early on said that the show will go on, no matter what the weather is. In the March 2008 issue of WWE Magazine, WWE set designer Jason Robinson revealed that a steel rig with a tarpaulin roof would be built above the ring itself to prevent rain. In that same issue, an initial design of the ring setup was revealed showing a bigger rig surrounding the tarpaulin rig, with lighting and two giant screens attached. The bigger rig was dropped from the final design with the lighting and video screens now featuring on the tarpaulin rig as well as the sound system. During an interview, WWE production manager Brian Petree mentioned that video reinforcement should prevent anyone from being obstructed by the steel structure. Up to seven generators were used to power up the show.

The set design for the entrance stage was at the north end of the stadium and consisted of another steel structure with various video screens hanging from it. The steel beams for the structure were custom built in Belgium and shipped over to Orlando. According to WWE Magazine, the amount of pyrotechnics used would be ten times that of the amount used on "Raw". Without the restriction of a roof, the pyrotechnics for the show shot as high as 2,000 ft as compared to WrestleMania 23's height of 150 ft. The fireworks were set off from boats on one of the lakes nearby the stadium. WWE has been said to have spent an estimated $300,000 on the fireworks alone. After the show, WWE was criticized for a malfunction in the pyrotechnics during The Undertaker's victory celebration. During the celebration, a hot cable for pyrotechnics was sent flying into audience members in the upper seating bowl of the stadium, leaving 45 injured with some hospitalized. The accident was apparently due to a cable which fireworks were travelling across snapping, thus resulting in the fireworks exploding into the top rows of the upper bowl of the stadium. WWE's corporate website released a statement afterwards stating that they will investigate the incident.

With the Citrus Bowl's locker rooms on the south side and the entrance set on the north side, a tented 40,000 ft² mini-city outside the north end served as the show's backstage area and included air conditioning, trailers, VIP areas, showers and restrooms. As a consequence, the road next to the north end zone, W. Church Street, was closed down until a day after the event. Numerous other roads were also closed to allow trucks and fork lifts to move in mega equipment for the event. The ring itself was built on the 50-yard line of the Citrus Bowl to give the best view for fans. Heavy-duty plastic flooring had been put over the field, to protect the turf, provide seating and serve as the steel structures' foundation.

Development on the set design began in the middle of 2007. The building of the actual set began in the middle of March. 100 people worked 16 hours a day to construct the set for the event. The construction finished on March 29.

WrestleMania XXIV was the first WrestleMania event to be filmed in high-definition. It will also be the first WWE show to be released on the Blu-ray Disc format by WWE Home Video.

Self-esteem

Self-esteem is the way people think about themselves, and how worthwhile they feel. Psychologists use the word self-esteem to describe whether someone likes them self or not. Someone with high self-esteem might think that they are good at things and are worthwhile. Someone with low self-esteem might think that they are bad at things and worthless. Different psychologists have different ways of measuring self-esteem, and many people do not agree with what it means. Some people think that self-esteem is linked to depression, eating disorders and bullying. Some people may also injure themselves if they suffer from a low self-esteem. 

Self-esteem also considered by the international law on human rights, such as Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Yogyakarta Principles, and they affirm that each person's self-esteem must be protected against any kind of abuse or violence out of social prejudices and discriminations.

World Health Organization also think that to make strong self-esteem is important to prevent the suicide of students as well as prevent bullying by tolerance.

Christiania

Freetown Christiania, shortly and commonly called just Christiania, is a Danish special community, as a village,partially self-governing with 850 inhabitants, and with an area of 85 acres near the capital of Denmark, Copenhagen. The Freetown is always in the centre of controversies, since its creation in a squatted military area in 1971. In the Freetown, cannabis was legal until 2004. Inhabitants of Christiania are called "Christianites". Christiania has become home to several ventures such as carpenters, blacksmiths, a bikeshop, as well as several cafés, restaurants, jazz, blues and night clubs.

In 2007, the National Heritage Agency proposed protection status for some of military buildings, now in Christiania. These are:

After the military had left, the area was only guarded by a few watchmen and sometimes of homeless people went in the area for sleep or for living there.On 4 September, 1971, neighbours of the area broke down a wall for making a place where their children could play.On 26 September, 1971, Christiania was opend to people by Jacob Ludvigsen, a well-known provo and journalist who published a magazine called "Hovedbladet" ('The main paper'). In the paper, Ludvigsen wrote an article in which he and five others went on exploration into what he called 'The Forbidden City of the Military'. The spirit of Christiania quickly developed into one of the hippie movement, the squatter movement, collectivism and anarchism, in contrast to the site's previous military use.

Meditation and yoga have always been popular activities for the Christianites, and for many years Christiania had their own internationally acclaimed theater group Solvognen, who, beyond their theater performances, also staged many happenings in Copenhagen and even throughout Sweden. Ludvigsen had always talked about drugs, hard drugs (now are illegal in Christiania) and soft drugs. The "problem" of drugs made Christiania really famous, and the most know part of the Freetown.
The neighbourhood of the Freetown is accessible through many entrances and cars are not allowed.Danish authorities have repeatedly removed the large stones blocking the main entrance claiming they need access to the area for fire trucks and ambulances in the event of a fire or medical emergency, yet the residents respond by placing them back each time as they feel attacks by the authorities. The people in Christiania have developed their rules, without the Danish government. The rules forbid stealing, violence, guns, knives, bulletproof and hard drugs. A famous street in the Freetown is known as "Pusher Street", where hash and Skunk weed were sold openly from permanent stands until 2004, it nevertheless does have rules forbidding hard drugs, such as cocaine, speed, ecstasy and heroin. The commerce is not really clean, but since the rules require a consensus they cannot be removed unless everybody agrees. The Since 1994, residents have paid taxes and fees for water, electricity, trash disposal, etc. The future of the area remains in doubt. In the street are forbidden photoes.

On April 24, 2005, a 26-year-old Christiania resident was killed and three other residents injured in a violent gang assassination on Pusher Street. The reason for this was a fight between few Christianites and people from the hash, market of Copenhagen. 

On May 14, 2007 workers from the governmental Forest and Nature Agency, helped by police, entered Christiania to destroy, abandoned building of "Cigarkassen" ('the cigar box'). They were met by angry and scared Christianites who feared that the police were going to demolish other houses too. Road blocks were built and the trucks were sabotaged so that they could not move.After the police then entered the Freetownand Christianites attacked heavily policemen with fireworks and stones, and built barricades in the street outside Christiania gate. The police used tear gas on the people. The police later had to retreat from Christiania. The riot continued over night ath the entrances to Christiania and Christianites bombarded the police with stones and Molotov cocktails. After that police retreat. All in all over 50 Christiania activists and rioters from outside were arrested. 

Since the 1970s the Gay House (Bøssehuset), one of Christiania's autonomous institutions, had been a centre for gay activism, parties and theatre. The how was very famous in Denmrk for humoristic and artistic verities shows, and became a meet point for all homosexuals in Copenhagen. Durin 1980s and 1990s the house was leaved without any ctivity. In 2002 The humorous and artistically high-ranking variety-style shows still have fame among Copenhagen homosexuals. The original pioneers having aged (and for some part died) during the 1980s and 1990s, the house was less used and was empty from about 2000 onwards. In 2002 a group of young gay performers and activists, Dunst, were invited to take over the house so it could remain a centre for gay creativity. However, after 9 months they were asked to leave Christiania again. Dunst claim they introduced a democratic management form and established open workshops for photography, art, music, dance, video etc. They also did a cbaret show. However three 'Save Christiania' nights, a cabaret show and three support parties in order to be able to downpay some of the Gay House's debt to Christiania. According to Dunst, however neighbours would never readily accept them and the newcomers were accused of not understanding "the Christiania lifestyle". Dunst claim they also received verbal abuse. In 2004 Dunst participated in 'Christiania Distortion' (an event supported by Christiania) in a bus circling araund the Freetown.

Around 1984 a biker gang had arrived in Christiania and conquered a part of the hash market. Violence on the premises increased at this period and many Christianites felt unsafe and unhappy with the new residents. This resulted in sabotage acts directed towards the bikers as well as the publication of several provocative manuscripts urging the Christianites to throw out the powerful and armed bikers. This tension culminated when the police found a murdered individual who had been sliced to pieces and buried beneath the floor of a building. Christiania reacted with two colossal community meetings—one outside the building—where it was agreed that the bikers had to leave. They did, and have never returned.

In Christiania cars are prohibited. However, 132 cars are owned by residents and need to be parked on the streets nearthe Freetown. In 2005, born a parking space for only 14 cars outside the Freetown. In 2001 few residents in one of Christiania's sections proposed to make a big parkking for their cars. other Christiania residents and citizens criticised the poposal.

Since its opening, Christiania has been famous for its open cannabis trade, taking place in the famous central street called 'Pusher Street'. Since 2003, however, the 'officially' open hash trade has been ended by authorities. However hs is still sold in the Freetown and sometimes harddrugs too, same if them ar eofficial proibhited in the city. Hard drugs, including heroin and cocaine, have been ruled out of Christiania since 1979 by the community's own rules.

In January 2006, the government proposed that Christiania would be turned into a mixed alternative community and residential area adding condominiums for 400 new residents. Current residents, now paying DKK 1450 (USD 250) per month, would be allowed to remain but need to begin paying normal rent for the facilities. Christiania has rejected this yhing , fearing the freetown would turn into a normal Copenhagen neighbourhood. In particular, the concept of privately owned dwellings is claimed to be incompatible with Christiania's collective ownership.

In order to present a reasonable use of area after an eventual "cleaning", the Danish government commissioned an architectural competition. 17 proposals were received, of which only eight have met the formal competition requirements. All of the proposals were rejected by ojudges. The cost of the architectural competition was 850,000 Danish Kroner (113,000 Euro, 145,000 USD).

Ungdomshuset

Ungdomshuset (in English: "the Youth House") was the popular name of the building formally named Folkets Hus ("House of the People") located on Jagtvej 69 in Nørrebro, Copenhagen. The Ungdomshuset was a meet point for many anarchists, for the music in the underground scene and leftist groups from 1982 until 2007, when after a long conflict between the municipal government of Copenhagen and the people living there, was smashed. Police started to clear the building early on Thursday, 1 March 2007. Demolition began on 5 March 2007 and was completed two days later. Ever since the eviction in March 2007, former users and supporters have held weekly demonstrations for a new Ungdomshuset, the demonstrations starting from nearby square 'Blågårds Plads' every Thursday at 5 p.m. and going to various places in Copenhagen. The starting point has recently been changed to Gammel Torv in response to the demonstraters saying they are getting closer to the politicians concerning a solution for a new Ungdomshus at an old school.In the summer of 2007, an iniative known as G13 wanted to squat an old public waterwork located on Grøndalsvænge Allé 13 in northwestern Copenhagen to be used as a new Ungdomshuset, the squat was non-violent, but was met with heavy opposition from the police who arrested 436 people and threw large amounts of tear gas

The building was completed on 12 November 1897, with the name "Folkets Hus" ("The People's House"). The house functioned as one of the resorts for the then-incipient labour movement of Copenhagen. Since labour organisations were unpopular in the eyes of the authorities. Years later the place helped poor people and was used for others uses. In 1918 when workers stormed the Danish Stock Exchange ("Børsen"). In 1910, The Second International held an International Women's conference at the house, during which Clara Zetkin launched the idea of an International Women's Day. Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg visited the centre. During the 1950s it was still primarily used by the different sections, associations and unions of the labour movement. All kinds of different activities took place: for example, boxing matches and end-of-season dances. Several years later Brugsen, a Danish chain of co-operative supermarkets, bought Folkets Hus, for makin a cheap supermarket. However, as this was prohibited by authorities for the historic importance of the place, so Brugsen sold the ground to the folk music ensemble Tingluti in 1978. The Tingluti sold the ground to the municipality of Copenhagen after few time.The price at the time was DKK 700,000. In 1982 Folkets Hus was assigned to a group of young people — the original founders of Ungdomshuset — however the municipality of Copenhagen still owned the building. It was at this time that the building was given its current name: Ungdomshuset. Nick Cave and Björk played there. In January 1996 Ungdomshuset was ravaged by a fire and found to be plagued by fungus and rot. The municipality of Copenhagen made plans to renovate the building for safety reasons, but encountered resistance from the occupants. In 1999 the building was put on sale to the highest bidder by the municipality, but same this time occupants opposed to the thing, and for jocking put over the build a large banner with the message ""For sale along with 500 autonome, stone throwing, violent psychopaths from hell."". After that a company called Human A/S bought the building in December 2000 (although ownership did not actually change hands until 2001), after which Human A/S was sold to the independent Christian sect "Faderhuset. However, the squatters refused to leave the house. Until 1 March 2007 the young squatters used the house as if the change of ownership had not happened and the new owners were not allowed inside at any time. The "Ungdomshuset" received more than 500 visitors a week.

Demolition of Ungdomshuset began at 8:00 am on 5 March 2007. The demolition was broadcast live by webcam on TV2 News' website. After the demolition of Ungdomshuset many riots began near the area for many days. Many cars were smashed and burned against the police.
A women's demonstration took place on 8 March, comprising more than 3 000 people. The police carried out systematic identity controls. In total, more than 750 people were arrested during the events (among them, about 140 foreigners). On 16 March, 2007, Danish police admitted to having mistakenly used a potentially lethal form of teargas. The gas, known as Ferret 40, was used against crowds during the riots following the demolition, although it is designed to penetrate doors and walls. 

According to professor Lars Dencik, from the University of Roskilde, the Danish state used the opportunity of this evacuation to test its anti-terrorist security forces (as any other opportunity, or real danger, was non-existent).

<doc id="99419" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99419" title="Printed circuit board">
Printed circuit board

A circuit board is a card made specially for attaching electronic components. The board is made of a material that does not conduct electricity, like fiberglass or plastic. Parts are then attached to this base using a conductive bonding material. This allows electricity to travel from one part to another, which is essential for the board to work. Inside the board, between the layers of insulating material, is copper for connecting the electricity between the electronic components. Boards consist of many different parts which are all connected together in circuit and all perform a different task. Circuit is the name for something which is looped. The most common circuit boards are called PCBs (printed circuit boards) and are most commonly mass produced ready for a specific job. Some circuit boards are made plain and a person can build their own for certain electrical tasks they need done. Most things that use electricity have at least one circuit board inside of them that makes them run.

Printed circuit boards came from electrical connection systems that were used in the 1850s. Originally metal strips or rods were used to connect large electric components mounted on wooden bases. The metal strips were replaced by wires connected to screw terminals, and wooden bases were replaced by metal frames. Smaller designs were still due to the increased size and complexity of the circuits they were hoping to build. In 1925, Charles Ducas of the United States submitted a patent application for a method of creating an electrical path directly on an insulated surface by printing through a stencil with electrically conductive inks. This method gave birth to the name "printed wiring" or "printed circuit."

In 1943, Paul Eisler of the United Kingdom patented a method of etching the conductive pattern, or circuits, on a layer of copper foil bonded to a glass-reinforced, non-conductive base. Eisler's technique was noticed by the US military and they started to use it in their new weapons in World War II. His idea did not come in to commercial use until the 1950s when the transistor was introduced. Up to that point, the size of vacuum tubes and other components were so large that the traditional mounting and wiring methods were all that was needed. With the introduction of transistors, however, the components became very small, and manufacturers turned to printed circuit boards to reduce the overall size of the electronic package.

Through-hole technology and its use in multi-layer PCBs were patented by the U.S. firm Hazeltyne in 1961. The resulting increase in the complexity and detailed paths started a new era in PCB design. Integrated circuit chips were introduced in the 1970s, and these components were quickly incorporated into printed circuit board design and manufacturing techniques. Today the Printed Circuit Board can have up to 8 layers in some applications.

The main task in designing a PCB is figuring out where all the components are going to go. Normally there is a design or schematic that will be turned into a PCB. There is no such thing as a standard printed circuit board. Each board is designed for its own use and must be the right size to fit the required space. Board designers use computer-aided design software to layout the circuit designs on the board. The spaces between electrical paths are often 0.04 inches (1.0 mm) or smaller. The location of the holes for component leads or contact points are also laid out. Once the circuit pattern is laid out, a negative image is printed out at exact size on a clear plastic sheet. With a negative image, the areas that are not part of the circuit pattern are shown in black and the circuit pattern is shown as clear. This design is made into instructions for a computer-controlled drilling machine or for the automatic solder paster used in the manufacturing process.

Many home made circuit boards are made with a light sensitive covering. This covering is sometimes called photo-resist. The covering reacts with light. Then the circuit board and covering are put in a developer. Developer is a liquid that dissolves the covering that was exposed to light. Then the board is put in an etchant. An etchant dissolves the copper that is not covered by the covering. Then the board is put into another liquid that removes the covering. Some companies also use this method. It is expensive per board, but very cheap to set up in the beginning.

Some professionally made circuit boards use a different method to remove extra copper from the circuit board. A process called silk-screening is used. Silk-screening is when a cloth is pulled tight over a frame. Then an image is printed onto the cloth. Then ink is pressed through the cloth. The ink does not go where stuff has been printed on the cloth. It is called silk-screening because the cloth is usually silk. The cloth is usually silk because it has very small holes. silk-screening is used to print an ink called resist onto the board. Resist is an ink that resists the etchant used to make the circuit board. Etchant dissolves the copper on the board. This is cheaper for each board than photo-resist, but is more expensive in the beginning.

Another way to make a circuit board is to use a mill. A mill is a drill that moves in many directions. The drill removes a small amount of copper each time it moves. The mill removes the copper around the wires on the board. This leaves extra copper on the board. Other methods do not leave the extra copper on the board. This method is cheaper per board, but is expensive in the beginning. It is also not commonly used in professionally made boards.

Pan's Labyrinth

Pan's Labyrinth (, literally "The Labyrinth of the Faun") is an Academy Award-winning Spanish language fantasy movie written and directed by Mexican movie-maker Guillermo del Toro. 

"Pan's Labyrinth" takes place in two places, known as a dual setting: in the "real world" the story is set in Spain during the time period shortly after the Spanish Civil War, and tells a story of a girl named Ofelia who is given three tasks by a mysterious faun. Meanwhile, her stepfather, the Falangist Captain Vidal, hunts the Spanish Maquis, guerrillas who continued fighting the Franco regime in the region, as her pregnant mother grows ill. The alternate setting is a secret "fantasy world" that Ofelia enters through an overgrown labyrinth garden, where she meets all manner of strange and magical creatures who become central to her story. The movie uses make-up, puppetry, and CGI effects to create its creatures.

The director of this movie, Del Toro said that he thinks the story to be a fable, influenced by fairy tales, and that it focuses on and continues themes related to his earlier movie "The Devil's Backbone", a spiritual sequel, though not an actual sequel. The original Spanish title refers to the mythological fauns of Greek mythology, while the English title refers specifically to the faun-like Greek god Pan (intended to help English-speakers differentiate the title from the term fawn). However, Del Toro has stated that the faun in the movie is not Pan. 

The movie was first shown at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. It was released in the United Kingdom on November 24, 2006. In the United States and Canada, the movie was given a limited release on December 29, 2006, with a nationwide release on January 19, 2007. "Pan's Labyrinth" has won numerous international awards, including three Academy Awards, the Ariel Award for Best Picture, and the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form.

Transubstantiation

Transubstantiation is the belief of Catholics and some other Christian churches that the bread and wine that are eaten and drank at Mass becomes (changes into) the body and blood of Jesus, who Christians believe is the son of God.

Christians who believe in transubstantiation believe that the bread they eat at Mass is the body of Jesus. They know that the bread still tastes like bread, looks like bread and smells like bread. It is just like bread, but it becomes the body of Jesus. The priest says prayers at Mass so that the bread and wine become the flesh and blood of Jesus.

This started when Jesus ate a meal called "The Last Supper" the night before he died. He said that the food his friends were eating was his body and blood. In the Bible (Matthew 26:26), it says, "Take this [bread] all of you and eat it. This is my body which will be given up for you," which means that he would die for them. Then, in Matthew 26:27, Jesus said, "Take this [cup] all of you and drink from it. This is the cup of my blood, the blood of the new and everlasting covenant." This means that Jesus's blood would make a promise forever between God and his people. Then he said, "My blood will be shed for you and for all so that sins may be forgiven." This means that Jesus would die for everyone so their sins, or things they do wrong, could be forgiven. Then he said, "Do this in memory of me." This is Jesus commanding people to continue what he did. From that time until now, people have continued what Jesus did and it reminds them of the Last Supper.

I noticed that was being added to closed RFD's, I was wondering if we want to add the template to a closed RFD or leave it as is? 22:11, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

On SE Wiktionary we've had some trouble with what we call the "Kent State Vandal" - a user or users from IP range 131.123.0.0 - 131.123.255.255, which WHOIS shows as Kent State University. Since we're smaller there, it's a little more obvious, but some digging here has unearthed the same user(s) making the same types of vandalism. Distinguishing features include quotes from Scrubs, South Park, Adam Sandler movies and other similar types of shows and movies, as well as making edits regarding general dissatisfaction with the United States economy and president. A lot of time and energy goes into reverting the vandalism from this range; I would imagine most of us have blocked a few of the offending IPs (I know I have). An admin on SE Wiktionary contacted Kent State with no response, so we recently did a few range blocks covering the main ranges of vandalism. I'd like to suggest doing so here as well. · 20:35, 26 February 2008 (UTC)

To give an example of edits:

7 users in this range have been blocked in the last month with edits (and blockings) going back to November 2007. The user often stops just short of being blocked so the amount of time and energy spent on reversions, not just blockings, is much higher than what it shown in the block logs. I would consider this to be long-term abuse and thus think a long-term (6 months to a year) soft block may be warranted. · 21:20, 26 February 2008 (UTC)


I've only warned 3 users from this range in the past month. This, to me, says that there isn't enough information honestly, to warrant a range block at this time. I think we should wait and see if more users from this range vandalize, and if that's the case, then we can consider a range block at that time. This is just my thoughts on this, 20:42, 26 February 2008 (UTC)

Further update: 131.123.0.0/16 soft-blocked for one year. · 20:56, 27 February 2008 (UTC)

I have noticed this range has been vandalising alot recently, so I went through the block log and found the ip's in the range of 203.208.0.0/16, while doing this I had noticed that they were close to the IP's that me and Cometstyles have been blocking as open proxies, which might explain this. Going back further I noticed that this IP's from this range were being blocked close to the times that attack username where being created for admins and the JEW BOT names, and going back even further I noticed that some of them were school IP's (the ranges listed at the bottom). These go back to January 2005, I feel that a range block is needed here, because the range has been vandalizing since 2005, most of the are probably open proxies, and some of them have been blocked for long term vandalism. What are your thoughts. 03:51, 27 February 2008 (UTC)

Some of the blocked IP's on this range:

Please remember to check , I checked there today and there were some that needed to be taken care of. 01:35, 29 February 2008 (UTC)

All right. I have been going over all of the users that I have warned throughout my time here at the Simple English Wikipedia, and I noticed a trend with this IP Address range. 82.198.250.xxx is the range that I am talking about. Almost every single address of this range has been warned at least once. Some examples of how they edit can be found by checking out these addresses:


are just some examples of the users that have been abusing their privledges here on the Simple English Wikipedia.

Further investigation of the reversions made by administrators, , , and have turned up another 15 addresses that have all been warned at least once. Investigation of the block log has revealed that even though none of the addresses have been blocked, the warnings given and the amount of addresses warned should prove long term abuse to this site.

An investigation of each user's contributions in the range 82.198.250.xxx (0-255 for the x's) have revealed that almost 90% of these users have been warned at least once in the past. Although I do not think that this is enough evidence to warrant a long term vandalism block, I just wanted to bring it to people's attention that I have found a trend in vandalism. Thank you for reading this long message. 20:57, 29 February 2008 (UTC)

I don't mean any offense, but I would really like to see a response to all my work that I put into this post :). I want to know if it was appreciated, and if I should do it again; or I want to know if it is not something I should do again in the future. Thanks, 16:31, 3 March 2008 (UTC)

This message that I am leaving here will touch base on a huge number of topics that I want to discuss here, so I have added the inuse template to the topic of this page so that nobody will edit conflict me while I talk about the 15 issues that I am going to bring up to the AN. Some of them don't fit here, but since the majority of them did, I decided to make this post here. Please bear with me whilst I write an extremely long message (probably around 15-20kbs). 16:49, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

The first issue that I would like to bring up is the fact that I think that it should only be administrators or bureaucrats that are able to close PGA/PVGA/PADs, like in the RFA page. This would provide some amount of control over what articles are allowed to become GA/VGA's and what articles aren't allowed to. 16:49, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

While I do commend the Simple English Wikipedia for getting 11 GA's in the past month, I still wish that there were more GAs and VGAs. Currently, I think that if there were about 20 GA's and 10 VGA's that that would be a sufficient number of articles to have in each category. I would therefore like to ask all editors here if they could please write some more articles that would be good possible GA/VGA's in the future. Thank you. 16:49, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

I am puzzled as to why there isn't a test1 or test4 template for removing content warning templates. Obviously, there should be, as we use a 4-level warning system, but for some reason, they don't exist. I hereby suggest that both of these templates should be created as soon as possible so that people who warn vandals can warn them better. 16:49, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

I am very disappointed that neither of these important js's work anymore. I would like to take the time to ask that if there are any JavaScript people out there, if they could correct both of these JavaScripts to make them work on the newest version of MediaWiki. Thanks. 16:49, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

I am also very disappointed to see that there are people out there who would abuse the unblock tool. This probably isn't that big of a deal, as administrators can easily protect the page to prevent them from abusing the unblock tool, but I think that we should stop it before it happens. Those are just my two cents.

Now to tackle the first big topic that I am going to bring up to the AN. Lately, I have been trying to devise ways of promoting ourselves so that we can get more active editors onto this site. I came up with a few ideas:



Both of these options are good choices (the first one more so than the second one), and both of these, I think, would be beneficial to this site more than they would harm the site. 

Alright, that's one big topic down! 16:49, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

This reminds me of . 00:23, 5 March 2008 (UTC)

The next big topic that I would like to bring to the administrators' notice in particular is of this whole issue surrounding Benniguy's latest unblock request. The request can be found here. People from around the site have been answering the call to this unblock request, and now, I believe that it is time that we provide a serious discussion about what is going to happen now. Ben claims that he is on better medication, and therefore, is in better shape to be editing this Wikipedia. He has posting up some very mature apologies, and all of his answers on this page have been very mature. I am in favor of letting him be unblocked, but I still have some issues with Benniguy:


Looking at some of my concerns above, and reading some of the other people's concerns at the unblock request page, I would therefore like to propose that we vote for him to be unblocked now. It has been about 1.5 weeks since Barliner proposed that we wait 2 weeks before voting for him to be unblocked, and now I think it is time. 16:49, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

Excuse me Creol, but I believe that your comments towards me above are unjust. But, I shall say no more on the matter, as we are not discussing me. As I have said a few times already, I know it will be hard to believe me for alot of you, because Ben is my Friend, and I very well could be lying for all you know. But, I believe that here, I am becoming a helpful and valuble editor to the team here and I would like to believe that you can trust me. I can assure you, that if I knew that Ben wanted to come back with ill intention, then I would cast my vote for him to stay blocked, because (as a few of you know), I am now into reverting vandilism, and if ben came back and played up, I would have to be one of the users here to help set things strait again - and I really would rather that not be done.
Getting onto Ben's treatment, He had been on a waiting list for about a year to recieve this treatment, and has finnally been put through to recieving it and I am grateful to the lord that it is having a posative effect on him, althpough it did not have an effect for the first week or so, it is all in full swing now. At school, he has been cheerful and enthusistic, as well as persistantly hard-working in the classes I take with him. He has also been quite the perfectionist - being hard on himself when he gets questions wrong or doesn't understand something. He seems to take more time and care over his work, and his mood swings havn't been seen at any time, infact, he goes to school all five days a week now, which used to be quite the achievement before.
I have been told that I should not participate in this vote - so you don't have to worry about me swinging the vote in Ben's favor. But to be honest, I'm neutral in this vote anyway, it won't really make a difference to me either way, because I'm just here to edit now.
Thank-you, I hope you take on board all that I say, but i completely understand if you choose toignore what I have said because of my closeness to the situation. But, as the only one who knows ben in real life, I have to say that I have seen a dramtic change in him for the better since the beginning of his treatment. Ben tells me that he will be scanning his medical certificate of treatment into the computer and uploading onto commons for those who are not nsure about wheather or not they belive him about his treatment.
Thnank-You again. 16:38, 5 March 2008 (UTC)

He said he doesn't mind, but i'll pass the message that you don't think it's a good idea. the certificate doensn't have to many details, just his name, DOB and aload of medical mumbo jumbo. 19:15, 5 March 2008 (UTC)

I would like to ask administrators if they think that we should be protecting high-risk templates like en:WP does. Do any of the current administrators here support this idea? If that's the case, then the following is a list of templates that I think should be protected because they are high-risk templates:


If you think up of any more templates that you think need to be protected, feel free to add them to the list. 16:49, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

There are several users that have been fairly inactive from this Wikipedia that I would like to propose that we remove their permissions due to inactivity:

Even though this user has been fairly active on this Wikipedia, however, the last checkuser thing he did was back in November of last year. I would therefore like to request that he be put up for removal of his Checkuser status due to inactivity. 16:49, 4 March 2008 (UTC)


Following up on the last post, I would therefore, if the community decides to demote M7 to nominate Tygrrr to succeed him. Tygrrr is much more active on this Wikipedia than M7, and therefore, I think he would be a better choice for Checkuser. 16:49, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

Blockinblox, even though he has done a great job of being a bureaucrat in the past, has not been very active recently. Even though he does have some amount of activity, the last time that he did any bureaucrat work was back in November of last year. I would therefore like to propose to the community that he is replaced with someone more active. 16:49, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

Following up on the last post, I would therefore, if the community decides to demote Blockinblox from bureaucrat to nominate Creol to succeed him. Creol is much more active, has done many great things for this Wikipedia, and is a very, very, very good candidate for becoming a bureaucrat. I would therefore like to say that Creol is a better choice for a bureaucrat. 16:49, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

Finally, I would like to suggest to the community that both of these sysops be desysopped from this Wikipedia due to inactivity. Both have done no edits since late 2006, which is just ridiculous. Just having them retain their sysop status would endanger us if a hacker got into their accounts. 16:49, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

I am sorry for bringing this up, but I just have to bring this up. I disapprove of anyone that is banned on the regular English Wikipedia from coming here to edit. I see of it as though we are both a testing grounds for banned users to rejoin the regular English Wikipedia's community afterwords, and as a way for those banned users to evade their ban. I am sick and tired of all the stress that it has caused our community in the past, and I want to prevent this from happening in the future. I would therefore like to suggest to this Wikipedia that all banned accounts from en:WP that create accounts here get blocked for the reasons that I have stated above. I would like to also ask all the administrators on here to talk in detail about this problem, as I believe that it is one that needs to be fixed. Cheers! 16:49, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

<doc id="99531" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99531" title="Swiss Federal Council">
Swiss Federal Council

The Swiss Federal Council (, , , ) is the group of seven people who are the federal government of Switzerland. As Switzerland does not have one person as "President", the Federal Council is also the head of state. 

The whole council is responsible for leading the federal administration of Switzerland, but each Councillor runs one of the seven federal ministries. The current members of the Federal Council for 2011 are:

The Federal Council was set up by the 1848 Federal Constitution as the "supreme executive and directorial authority of the Confederation". 

When the Constitution was written, constitutional democracy was still in its infancy, and the founding fathers of Switzerland had little in the way of examples. Switzerland has a long tradition of being governed by a council of representatives instead of one powerful ruler, so while they drew heavily on the U.S. Constitution for the organisation of the federal state as a whole, they opted for the council rather than the presidential system for the executive branch of government.) .

Today, only three other states, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and San Marino have more than one person act as head of state at a time. The collegial system of government is often used for government. Many countries have a form of cabinet government with collective responsibility (that is, all ministers in the cabinet support the decision of the cabinet as a whole).

After the 1959 elections a "Zauberformel" or "magical formula" was invented. The formula works out how many members of the Federal Council each political party has, and showed that the Federal Council is always a voluntary grand coalition. 

Based on their strengths in the Federal Assembly, the seats were distributed as follows:

The FDP and CVP have been getting less popular, and more people have supported the SVP and SPS. After the 2003 elections, the SVP asked for a CVP Council seat for their leader Christoph Blocher and threatened to otherwise leave the government. After the 2007 elections Blocher was replaced by another member of the CVP, so the strength of the parties is still:

Women did not get the federal vote until 1971. The first woman to be an official candidate was Lilian Uchtenhagen in 1983.

In total, only six out of 109 Councillors (or out of 27 Councillors elected since 1971) have been women:

Each year, one of the seven Councillors is elected by the Federal Assembly as "President of the Confederation". The Federal Assembly also elects a Vice President. By convention, the positions of President and Vice President rotate annually, each Councillor thus becoming Vice President and then President every seven years while in office. The same person cannot be President two years in a row, or be elected Vice President in the years after he has been President.

According to the Swiss order of precedence, the President of the Confederation is the highest-ranking Swiss official. He or she presides over Council meetings and carries out certain representative functions that, in other countries, are the business of the Head of State. In urgent situations where a Council decision cannot be made in time, he or she is empowered to act on behalf of the whole Council. Apart from that, though, he or she is a "primus inter pares", having no power above and beyond the other six Councillors.

The President is not the Swiss head of state (this function is carried out by the Council acting together. However the President acts and is recognized as head of state while conducting official visits abroad, as the members of the Council never leave the country at the same time. More often, though, official visits abroad are carried out by the head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. Visiting heads of state are received by all the Federal Council together.

The Federal Council meets each Wednesday at the "Bundeshaus" in Bern, the seat of the Swiss federal government. 

Apart from the seven Councillors, the following officials also attend the meetings:

After the meetings, the Councillors always take lunch together. The Council also meets regularly in to discuss important topics at length, and annually conducts what is colloquially referred to as its "school excursion", a day trip to some attractions in the President's home canton. In that and other respects, the Council operates not unlike a board of directors of a major corporation.

Each Federal Councillor heads a government department, much like the ministers in the governments of other countries. Colloquially and by the press, they are often referred to as ministers. For example the head of the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sportsis often called the "minister of defence". However, as Council members, they are not only responsible for their own department, but also for the business of their colleagues' departments as well, and for the conduct of the government and the federal administration as a whole.

The meetings of the Federal Council and the result of the votes taken are not open to the public, and the records remain sealed for 50 years. This has lately been the subject of some criticism. In particular, the parties at the ends of the political spectrum argue that this secrecy is contrary to the principle of transparency. However, the Council has always said that secrecy is necessary to reach consensus and to preserve the collegiality and political independence of the individual Councillors.

Despite the secrecy rule, details of the votes and the arguments in Council are sometimes leaked to the press, resulting in (generally fruitless) investigations and criminal prosecutions of the leaking staff member.

Due to the Federal Council's unique nature as a voluntary grand coalition of political opponents, its operation is subject to numerous constitutional conventions. Most notable is the principle of collegiality; that is, the Councillors are supposed not to publicly criticise one another, even though they are often political opponents. In effect, they are expected to publicly support all decisions of the Council, even against their own personal opinion or that of their political party. In the eye of many observers, this convention has become rather strained after the 2003 elections (see below).

The members of the Federal Council are elected for a term of four years by both chambers of the federal parliament sitting together as the Federal Assembly. Each Councillor is elected individually by secret ballot by an absolute majority of votes. Every adult Swiss citizen is eligible, but in practice, only Members of Parliament or more rarely, members of Cantonal governments are nominated by the political parties and receive a substantial amount of votes. The voting is conducted in several rounds: in the first two rounds, anyone can enter their name; but in subsequent rounds, the person receiving the least votes is removed from the race until one candidate gains an absolute majority.

With Council seats allocated to parties by unwritten agreement (see above), Federal Council elections generally are unexciting, pleasant affairs. Usually, the party which has a seat to fill presents two candidates with mainstream viewpoints to the United Federal Assembly, which then chooses one. This was not so, however, during the 2003 election, which was the most controversial in recent memory (see also above).

Once elected, Councillors remain members of their political parties, but hold no leading office with them. In fact, they usually maintain a certain political distance from the party leadership, because under the rules of collegiality, they will often have to publicly promote a Council decision which does not match the political conviction of their party (or of themselves).

Once elected for a four-year-term, Federal Councillors can neither be voted out of office by a motion of no confidence nor can they be impeached. Re-election is possible for an indefinite number of terms, and it has historically been extremely rare for Parliament not to re-elect a sitting Councillor. This has only happened four times - to Ulrich Ochsenbein in 1854, to Jean-Jacques Challet-Venel in 1872, to Ruth Metzler-Arnold in 2003 and to Christoph Blocher in 2007. In practice, therefore, Councillors serve until they decide to resign and retire to private life, usually after three to five terms of office.

Unlike most senior members of government in other countries, the Federal Councillors are not entitled to an official residence. Mostly, they have chosen to rent apartments or hotel suites in Bern (at their own expense); the only contemporary exception being Moritz Leuenberger, who daily commutes by train from Zürich to Bern. However, they are entitled to use the Federal Council's country estate, Lohn, for holidays; this estate is also used to host official guests of the Swiss Confederation. 

Councillors can have an Army security detail if they need personal protection (in particular during official events). But often one can meet them without any escort at all in the streets, restaurants and tramways of Bern. Councillors are also entitled to a personal bailiff ("Weibel") who accompanies them, in a colourful uniform, to official events. This tradition goes back through the republican governments of the ancient Swiss cantons, right back to the lictors of the ancient Roman Republic.

The spouses of Councillors do not play an official part in the business of government, apart from accompanying the Councillors to official receptions.

Federal Councillors draw a yearly remuneration of about CHF 400,000 (circa EUR 256,000 / USD 404,000). After completing a full term of office, they are entitled to a perennial yearly pension of half that amount after leaving office.

While Councillors are forbidden by law to hold any other post during their term of office, it is not unusual for them to accept lucrative business engagements after leaving office, e.g., on the board of directors of major Swiss corporations.

Federal Councillors, like Members of Parliament, enjoy absolute legal immunity for all statements made in their official capacity.

For crimes not relating to their official capacity, they can be prosecuted only with the permission of the Federal Council as a whole while in office. The prosecutor can appeal a refusal to grant permission to the Federal Assembly. 

Prosecution for crimes and misdemeanors that do relate to the Councillors' official capacity requires the assent of the Federal Assembly. In such cases, Parliament can also suspend the Councillor in office (but not actually remove her or him).

According to statements to the media by a Federal Chancellory official, in none of the few cases of accusations against a Federal Councillor has the permission to prosecute ever been granted. Such cases usually involved statements considered offensive by members of the public. However, one unnamed Councillor involved in a traffic accident immediately prior to his date of resignation was reported to have voluntarily waived his immunity, and Councillor Elisabeth Kopp decided to resign upon facing an inquiry over allegations of secrecy violations.

Historically, the collegial government of Switzerland has been assessed both internationally and nationally as exceptionally competent and stable. The Federal Council as a whole (although not individual members) has consistently maintained public approval and confidence rates in excess of sixty percent, possibly also because under the Swiss system of direct democracy, voters can vent their displeasure with government decisions when deciding individual issues at the ballot box.

However, lately there has been a growing contention that the Federal Council is often too slow to respond to the needs of the moment, too resistant to change and too weak to lead the powerful federal bureaucracy. Various changes have been proposed to address these issues, including expanding the powers of the presidency, expanding the Federal Council itself or adding a second layer of ministers between the Council and the departments. None of these proposals has yet borne fruit, however.

World Wrestling Entertainment programs

World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) has a wide range of shows all over the world, including television, films, online, video on demand and pay-per-views. 

WWE currently runs with three major shows on television. They are: "Raw", "Friday Night SmackDown!", "WWE Superstars" and "ECW". WWE also airs recap shows: "A.M. Raw" (not in UK), "The WWE Experience", "Bottom Line", and "Afterburn".

Since WWE's departure from Spike TV in the United States, WWE has moved "Heat" on to their website as a webcast, while overseas it is still shown as a regular television program. The latest episode of Heat is put up on WWE.com every Friday afternoon. Other webcasts such as "WWE Rollin", "WWE Sidesplitters" and "WWE Uncut" can be found in the "All Videos" section of WWE.com.

World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) has had a large Web presence for years. In 1996 it was nominated for a Streaming Media Award and in 1999 for its online content.


FOX8 is currently the only network to air all televised shows in Australia. Times for programmes are as follows and are in EST:


WWE programming on Brazil is shown on FX Latin America, and later on, in December of 2007, by SBT (Brazilian Television System.)


WWE Programming shows on FX Latin America are not scheduled here, Raw and SmackDown! airs trough national aircasting station Repretel Canal 11 (Repretel channel 11)



The BOX is currently the only network to air all television shows in New Zealand.

WWE Programming shows on FX Latin America and ATV Andina de Radio Difusión in Peru.


In the Philippines, WWE programming is shown on Jack TV, and Associated Broadcasting Company (ABC). All times are in Philippine Standard Time
In Portugal, WWE programming is shown on SIC Radical, and on TVI


TEN Sports airs WWE programs in South Asian countries such as Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Maldives, and Bhutan, etc. 



Most of WWE's programs are shown on Sky Sports 3 apart from "WWE Experience", "Saturday Night's Main Event" and pay-per-views.


Since 2003, WWE has produced its own film productions. Instead of focusing on wrestling movies, WWE produces movies that are non-wrestling related. WWE and Vince McMahon were credited for production of the films "The Scorpion King", "The Rundown" and "Walking Tall" all starring The Rock (Dwayne Johnson). 

WWE Films has since ventured in on their own, releasing, "See No Evil", a horror movie, starring Kane and also "The Marine", an action movie starring John Cena. WWE has also noted that Steve Austin has agreed to star in three movie deals, the first being "The Condemned".

In 2004, WWE announced a new video on demand service for digital cable users, allowing subscribers to the service access to matches in the promotion's extensive video library. The programming is broken into six sections and features classic shows, matches, and features highlighting legends of wrestling.







WWE is currently one of the leaders in pay-per-view content for cable and satellite television. Pay-per-views account for approximately 25% of WWE revenues. There are fourteen live shows for North America, four for United Kingdom, four for Australia and two for Japan. The pay-per-view events WWE hold currently are:

Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan

Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is a 2006 mockumentary (comedy movie) by the English comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. The main character, Borat, is a rude, stupid reporter who interviews famous people and normal people. The movie was very popular, but also seen as wrong and offensive by some people. This is because it was seen as anti-semitic (against Jews) and racist (against black people). Sacha Baron Cohen says this is wrong and he is Jewish himself.

The plot of the movie is about Borat and his friend going to America from Kazakhstan to make a movie about America. Borat looks very stupid and ignorant in America. Borat falls in love with Pamela Anderson after seeing her on television in his hotel. He decides to go to see her while making the movie. He meets many people along the way, interviewing them.

Miley Stewart

Miley Ray Stewart, or Hannah Montana is a fictional character played by Miley Cyrus on the Disney Channel television show "Hannah Montana". She is the main character in the series. Hannah Montana is about Miley Stewart, a teenage school girl who, at night, lives as a pop star, Hannah Montana.

Miley Stewart is an ordinary teenager who has two lives, one as a school girl, the other as a pop star, Hannah Montana. She is from Tennessee, but now lives in California with her father Robby Ray, and brother Jackson. Robby was a singer like Miley, and now lives two lives as her father, and manager and producer. 

Miley's mother died when she was young. Roxy is Hannah Montana's bodyguard who protects the family, whether they want her to or not.

When Miley arrives at Seaview Middle School, she meets her best friends, Lilly Truscott and Oliver Oken. Lilly finds out that Miley is Hannah Montana in the first episode, when she breaks into Hannah's dressing room. In the second episode, Oliver's crush on Hannah Montana is shown, and because of this, Miley tells him her secret. In the second season, she begins to go to her brother's high school with Lilly and Oliver. Because of her two lives, Miley often has problems (such as sleeping in late on a school day after a concert).

Miley's enemies are Amber Addison (Shanica Knowles) and Ashley Dewitt (Anna Maria Perez de Tagle), who are constantly mean to her and her friends, but are huge fans of Hannah Montana. Later, she gets used to her school, and meets a famous actor, Jake Ryan. She has a on and off relationship with him.

Miley is famous for saying some phrases, such as "Ya think?!" whenever someone says the obvious, and "Sweet niblets!", when worried and scared. If someone says something crazy, Miley or Hannah will say something like "'Washed up ballplayer say what?'" as in Bye Bye Ball. 

Miley also has a stuffed bear named Beary who has been seen in many episodes. She has had Beary since she was three (as revealed in "Me and Rico down by the schoolyard". Beary was destroyed in the episode "Bye Bye Ball", when Jackson was trying to kill a wasp, but Jackson was later able to fix him.

It has been shown that Miley's friends and most members of the Stewart family know that Miley is Hannah Montana. Below is the list of people mentioned in the series that know Miley's secret.

O. J. Simpson

Orenthal James "O. J." Simpson (born July 9, 1947), also known by his nickname, The Juice, is a retired American football player. He originally attained stardom as a running back at the collegiate and professional levels, and was the first NFL player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season. He later worked as an actor, spokesman and broadcaster. 

He was tried for the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in 1994. The criminal court found that Simpson was not guilty of those murders, in 1995. The criminal case was a long one. In 1997, Simpson was found liable for their wrongful deaths in civil court, but to date he has paid little of the $33.5 million judgment. He gained further notoriety in late 2006 when he wrote a book titled "If I Did It". The book, which purports to be a first-person fictional account of the murder had he committed it, was withdrawn by the publisher just before its release. The book was later released by the Goldman family and the title of the book was expanded to "If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer" (ISBN 978-0-8253-0588-7). 

In September 2007, Simpson faced more lawsuits, as he was arrested and subsequently charged with numerous felonies, including but not limited to robbery, burglary, assault, first-degree kidnapping with use of a deadly weapon (which carries possible life sentence), coercion with use of a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit robbery, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, and conspiracy to commit a crime.

Woody Guthrie

Woodrow Wilson Guthrie, better known as Woody Guthrie (July 14, 1912 – October 3, 1967), was an American folk musician and songwriter, of the 20th century.

Guthrie wrote over a thousand songs during his career. His more famous songs include "This Land Is Your Land", "Mail Myself To You", "This Train", "Bound For Glory", and "Hobo's Lullaby". One of his most famous albums was titled "Dust Bowl Ballads". He sang about the Great Depression, and the problems faced by farmers at the time of the Dust Bowl, when erosion and drought ruined millions of acres of farmland.

Guthrie recorded a series of songs for the United States government, about sexually transmitted diseases, that served as warnings to the public. Much of the time he appeared opposed to governments as he saw them, and also politics. Guthrie identified strongly with the , called the "Wobblies", and also the Communist Party, but he never joined either one. His songs, and his interpretations of older songs, spoke to people of many different beliefs. Many of his songs used old tunes, that he gave new words.

The composer names of most folk songs are lost to history, or their songs have been adapted so many times that they completely change form. Even though Guthrie and his songs were well-known, they came to be accepted as genuine folk songs. They appeared in , and were performed and recorded by many different artists, and also sung by amateurs and families at home. Guthrie worked with or influenced many later musicians. "Ramblin' Jack" Elliott was a of his, who later went off on his own.
Guthie's career was cut short by a disease called , which over time left him in a wheelchair, then finally unable to get out of bed, or even hold a guitar. He spent many years in a hospital, visited by his family and friends. Fellow folk musician Pete Seeger was a regular visitor.

One day the young Bob Dylan came to visit Guthrie. He had hitchhiked his way from Minnesota to New York, to meet Guthrie and try to become a professional musician. He played Guthrie "A Song to Woody", which he'd written as a tribute. Guthrie liked Dylan, and invited him back. Dylan stayed with the Guthrie family, and became friends with thirteen-year-old Arlo Guthrie, who also became a musician.

Guthrie died in 1967, from the effects of Huntington's Chorea. There have been many tributes made to Guthrie and his music through the years. Actor David Carradine played him in the movie "Bound for Glory". Guthrie's songs are still sung today, and are a symbol of American life.

East Bengal

East Bengal (Bengali:পূর্ব বেঙ্গল) is the eastern part of Bengal. East and West Bengal were once part of British India. After the British left, the east and west parts of Bengal were split between Pakistan and the Republic of India's West Bengal province, with an area of 55,126 mi or (142,776 km). East Bengal also used to be called East Pakistan until it became independent from Pakistan. Today it is called Bangladesh.

Before 1905, the first time it was called "East Bengal" was during British rule of India. British rule of a large area of Indian territory began with Robert Clive's win over the Nawab of Bengal, Siraj ud-Daulah, at the Battle of Plassey in 1757. The win gave the British East India Company dominion over Bengal, which became the of British administration in the sub-continent. After the Indian of 1857 (known as the "Mutiny"), the British government took direct control away from the East India Co., and got its imperial capital at Calcutta, the city founded by the Company. By 1900, the British place of Bengal was a big territory, all the way from the Burmese border to deep into the "Ganges valley."

Gerhard Ertl

Professor Gerhard Ertl is a German physicist in the Department of Physical Chemistry of the Fritz Haber Institute of the MPG . He was born on October 10th 1936 in Stuttgart, Germany. Professor Ertl won the Nobel prize for Chemistry in 2007.

Ertl’s research laid the foundation of modern surface chemistry, which has helped explain how fuel cells produce energy without pollution, how catalytic converters clean up car exhausts and even why iron rusts, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. 

His work has paved the way for development of cleaner energy sources and will guide the development of fuel cells, said Astrid Graslund, secretary of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. 

The Nobel academy said Ertl provided a detailed description of how chemical reactions take place on surfaces. His findings applied in both academic studies and industrial development, the academy said. “Surface chemistry can even explain the destruction of the ozone layer, as vital steps in the reaction actually take place on the surfaces of small crystals of ice in the stratosphere,” the award citation reads. 

Ertl and his wife Barbara have two children and several grandchildren. His hobbies include playing the piano and also playing with his cats.

Professor Ertl is an editor of the Handbook of Heterogeneous Catalysis

Professor Ertl studied physics at the Technical University of Stuttgart from 1955 to 1957. He studied at the University of Paris from 1957 to 1958 and then at Ludwig Maximillians University in Munich from 1958 to 1959. He returned to the Technical University of Stuttgart where he got a diplom of physics in 1961. Then he studied at the Technical University of Munich and got a PhD in 1965.

After getting his PhD, he stayed in Munich as an assistant and a lecturer between 1965 and 1968. Then, he moved to the Technical University of Hannover where he worked as Professor and Director from 1968 to 1973. In 1973, Professor Ertl returned to the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich to work as a professor at the Institute of Physical Chemistry. He worked there until 1986 and during this time was a regular visitor to the California Institute of Technology, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the University of California, in Berkeley where he worked as a visiting professor. In 1986, he became professor at the Free University of Berlin and the Technical University of Berlin. He was director at the Fritz Haber Institute of the MPG from 1986 and was also a professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin from 1996. Professor Ertl retired in 2004.

Professor Ertl studied the of ammonia, iron, carbon monoxide and palladium to help make modern catalytic converters. He studied platinum to learn about its atoms.

Professor Ertl helped to develop new ways of using microscopes. One was called low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) used at the beginning of his career and later he worked on ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and scanning tunneling microscope (STM).

Professor Ertl and Gabor A. Somorjai won the Wolf Prize for Chemistry in 1998 for outstanding results in surface science and for discovering how crystals react to experiments. 
Professor Ertl was awarded the Nobel prize for chemistry in 2007 for more studies of surface science.

John William Waterhouse

John William Waterhouse (6 April 1849 – 10 February 1917) was an English painter in the Pre-Raphaelite style. He worked after the breakup of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and so was called "the modern Pre-Raphaelite". He was also influenced by his contemporaries, the Impressionists. His artworks were known for their depictions of women from both ancient Greek mythology and Arthurian legend.

Born in Italy to English parents who were both painters, he later moved to London, where he enrolled in the Royal Academy of Art. He soon began exhibiting at their annual summer exhibitions, focusing on the creation of large canvas works depicting scenes from the daily life and mythology of ancient Greece. Later on in his career he came to embrace the Pre-Raphaelite style of painting despite the fact that it had gone out of fashion in the British art scene several decades before. 

Although not as well known as earlier Pre-Raphaelite artists such as Dante Rossetti, John Millais and William Holman Hunt, Waterhouse's work is currently displayed at several major British art galleries, and the Royal Academy of Art organised a major retrospective of his work in 2009.

Semantic Web

The Semantic Web is a project of the W3C that uses metadata to let computers understand the information on the internet. This would make computers able to do more of the work involved in finding, sharing and combining information on the internet.

The Semantic Web is an idea of the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners Lee. He wants to make the web more intuitive about how to meet a user's needs. The semantics of information and services is defined in Web Ontology Language and RDF Schemas. These are used to give a formal description of concepts, terms, and relationships within a given area of knowledge.

Tim Berners-Lee's Idea was as follows:
The World Wide Web is based on HTML documents. The semantic web involves using Resource description Framework (RDF) that has data that computers use. The layout used in HTML will be stored separately such as in a CSS file. RDF and OWL can either supplement or replace the content of web documents (XHTML).

In this way a machine can use the knowledge itself. By using the information in ways similar to human reasoning it can create more meaningful results.

Hypersonic (disambiguation)

Hypersonic speeds are speeds that are highly supersonic.

Hypersonic can be any of the following:

Hypersonic

In aerodynamics, hypersonic speeds are speeds that are highly supersonic. The word hypersonic came from a word used in the 1970s, Mach 5, or 5 times the speed of sound. Everything about the plane changes greatly when the airplane that is flying at those speeds reaches supersonic speeds. 

Though the definition for hypersonic speeds is not very clear and is a subject of debate among scientists, they have come up with a possible definition. A hypersonic flow may be characterized by certain things that can no longer be discounted in analysis. Some of these things include:

As the plane goes faster and mach numbers increase, the density behind the shock also goes up. This happens in concert with a decrease in volume behind the shock wave because of the conservation of mass theory. Because of this, the shock layer (the volume between the body and the shock wave) is thin at high mach numbers.

As a plane goes faster and mach numbers go up, the entropy change across the shock also goes up. This results in a strong entropy gradient and highly vortical flow that mixes with the boundary layer.

Some of the big kinetic energy found with flow at large mach numbers becomes internal energy in the fluid because of viscosity. The increase in internal energy makes the temperature go up. Because the pressure gradient normal to the flow within a boundary layer is zero, the increase of temperature through the boundary layer causes the density to fall. This causes the boundary layer over the body of the airplane to grow. This, in turn, causes the temperature to go up.

Leonid Hurwicz

Professor Leonid "Leo" Hurwicz was an American economist and mathematician. He was born in Moscow, city in Russia on August 21, 1917. He invented the economic sciences of incentive compatibility and mechanism design. International economy and trade is studied using the ideas Professor Hurwicz had.

Hurwicz works as Regents Professor of Economics (head teacher of economics) at the University of Minnesota. Professor Hurwicz believes that game theory is very important. Hurwicz shared the 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Eric Maskin and Roger Myerson for their work on ways mechanism design.

Professor Hurwicz was born in Moscow, Russia to a Jewish family a few months before the October Revolution. His family is Polish and had lived in Congress Kingdom (the part of Poland then in the Russian Empire) but they moved to Russia to escape World War I. Soon after Professor Hurwicz was born, the family returned to Warsaw, in Poland. Hurwicz and his family were treated very badly by the Bolsheviks and Nazis because they were Jewish. He became a refugee again when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. His parents and brother ran away to Warsaw where they were arrested by the Soviets and sent to labor camps. Hurwicz was forced to move to Switzerland, then to Portugal and finally in 1940 he moved to the United States. His family joined him there after some time.

Hurwicz hired Evelyn Jensen to help him teach during the 1940s. She grew up on a Wisconsin farm and was studying economics at the University of Chicago. Leonid and Evelyn got married in 1944 and later, lived on the Mississippi River parkway in Minneapolis, Minnesota. They have four children called Sarah, Michael, Ruth and Maxim. 

He has interests in linguistics, archaeology, biochemistry and music. He has researched for meteorology and is a member of the National Science Foundation department for trying to control the weather. When Eugene McCarthy ran for president of the United States (1968), Hurwicz was a Minnesota delegate to the Democratic Party Convention and a member of the Democratic Party Platform Committee.

Professor Hurwiczs father wanted him to study law and he did. In 1938 Hurwicz got a degree from Warsaw University. He enjoyed studying in economics class and went to the London School of Economics with Nicholas Kaldor and Friedrich Hayek. In 1939 he moved to Geneva where he studied at the Graduate Institute of International Studies and studied Ludwig von Mises teaching. After moving to the United States he studied more economics at Harvard University and the University of Chicago. Professor Hurwicz does not have a degree in economics but he won the Nobel prize for economics in 2007. He said, "Whatever economics I learned, I learned by listening and learning."

In 1941 Hurwicz was helping Paul Samuelson to teach at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and helping Oskar Lange to teach at the University of Chicago. At Illinois Institute of Technology during the war, Hurwicz taught electronics to the U.S. Army Signal Corps. Then from 1942 to 1944, at the University of Chicago, he was a member of the faculty of the Institute of Meteorology and taught statistics in the Department of Economics. His advisors in 1942 were Jacob Marschak and Tjalling Koopmans of the University of Chicago, who now work for the Cowles Foundation at Yale University.

Hurwicz received a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1945–1946. In 1946 he became a professor of economics at Iowa State College. From January 1942 until June 1946, he was a researcher for the Cowles Commission. He worked full time for the Cowles Commission until October 1950 until January 1951, he was a visiting professor, teaching at classes that were taught before by Professor Koopman in the Department of Economics, and he was a very important professor there. He was also a research professor of economics and statistics at the University of Illinois, a consultant to the RAND Corporation for the University of Chicago and a consultant to the U.S. government. Hurwicz continued to be a consultant to the Cowles Commission until about 1961.
Hurwicz was given a job by Walter Heller at the University of Minnesota in 1951, where he became a professor of economics and mathematics in the School of Business Administration. Most of his work for the rest of his life was in Minnesota, but he studied and was a teacher elsewhere in the United States and Asia. In 1955 and again in 1958 Hurwicz was a visiting professor, and a fellow on the second visit, at Stanford University and there in 1959 he published "Optimality and Informational Efficiency in Resource Allocation Processes" on making rules for buyers and sellers and governments share wealth. He taught at Bangalore University in 1965 and, during the 1980s, at Tokyo University, People's University (now Renmin University of China) and the University of Indonesia. In the United States he was a visiting professor at Harvard in 1969, at the University of California, Berkeley in 1976, at Northwestern University twice in 1988 and 1989, at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1998, the California Institute of Technology in 1999 and the University of Michigan in 2002. He was a visiting Distinguished Professor at the University of Illinois in 2001.
In the University of Minnesota in 1961, Hurwicz became chairman of the Statistics Department, Regents Professor of Economics in 1969, and Curtis L. Carlson Regents Professor of Economics in 1989. He taught subjects ranging from theory to welfare economics, public economics, rules for large companies and mathematical economics. Although he retired from full time teaching in 1988, Hurwicz taught graduate school as Professor Emeritus in the autumn of 2006. In 2007 his ongoing research was described by the University of Minnesota as "comparison and analysis of systems and techniques of economic organization, welfare economics, game-theoretic implementation of social choice goals, and modeling economic institutions." Professor Hurwiczs published works in these fields date back to 1944. Professor Hurwicz is known internationally for his good work researching economic theory, specially with rules for big businesses and governments using mathematical economics. In the 1950s, he worked with Kenneth Arrow on non-linear programming. Kenneth Arrow became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Economics prize in 1972. Hurwicz helped Daniel McFadden, who won a Nobel prize in 2000. 

Hurwiczs work was important to help show how large economic systems should be studied. Some of these systems are capitalism and socialism. Professor Hurwiczs ideas of how to share wealth are also very important. The theory of incentive compatibility that Hurwicz developed changed the way many economists think about sharing in the future, explaining why centrally planned economies may fail and how rewards for certain people make a difference when making decisions. 

Hurwicz is part of teams who edit several journals. He co-edited and contributed to two collections for Cambridge University Press: "Studies in Resource Allocation Processes" (1978, with Kenneth Arrow) and "Social Goals and Social Organization" (1987, with David Schmeidler and Hugo Sonnenschein). His recent journals include "Economic Theory" (2003, with Thomas Marschak), "Review of Economic Design" (2001, with Stanley Reiter) and "Advances in Mathematical Economics" (2003, with Marcel K. Richter). Hurwicz has taught works by Fisher-Schultz (1963), Richard T. Ely (1972), David Kinley (1989) and Colin Clark (1997).

Hurwicz was voted to be a fellow of the Econometric Society in 1947 and in 1969 was the Econometric Societys president. Hurwicz was made part of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965. In 1974 he was made a part of the National Academy of Sciences and in 1977 was made a Distinguished Fellow of the American Economic Association. Hurwicz was given a National Medal of Science in 1990 by President of the United States George H. W. Bush, for studying Behaviorial and Social Science, given to him for his new work on the theories of how to share wealth in modern decentralization.

He served on the United Nations Economic Commission in 1948 and the United States National Research Council in 1954. In 1964 he was a member of the National Science Foundation Commission on Weather Modification. He is a member of the American Academy of Independent Scholars (1979) and a Distinguished Scholar of the California Institute of Technology (1984).

Hurwicz has received six honorary doctorates (PhD), from Northwestern University (1980), the University of Chicago (1993), Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (1989), Keio University (1993), Warsaw School of Economics (1994) and Universität Bielefeld (2004). He is an honorary visiting professor of the Huazhong University of Science and Technology School of Economics (1984).

Some important things have been given Professor Hurwiczs name such as the Hurwicz criterion, an idea that Professor Hurwicz had in 1950, and is thought of as very important for economics. The Hurwicz Criterion is also called "under uncertainty". Hurwicz had the idea of putting Abraham Walds work together with work done by Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1812. Hurwiczs Criterion tells people to think very carefully of what is good and what is bad before making decisions. Different types of Hurwiczs Criterion have been thought of. Leonard Jimmie Savage made some changes to the first Hurwiczs criterion in 1954. The four peoples work — Laplace, Wald, Hurwicz and Savage — that the Hurwicz Criterion has been based on was studied, corrected and used for over fifty years by many different people including John Milnor, G. L. S. Shackle, Daniel Ellsberg, R. Duncan Luce and Howard Raiffa, but some people say the work was started by Jacob Bernoulli.

The Leonid Hurwicz Distinguished Lecture is given to the Minnesota Economic Association. John Ledyard (2007), Robert Lucas, Roger Myerson, Edward C. Prescott, James Quirk, Nancy Stokey and Neil Wallace are some of the people who have given the lecture since it was thought to be important in 1992.

In October 2007, Hurwicz shared "The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel" with Eric Maskin of the Institute for Advanced Study and Roger Myerson of the University of Chicago "for having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory." During a telephone interview, a member of the Nobel Foundation told Hurwicz and his wife that Hurwicz is the oldest person ever to win the Nobel Prize. Hurwicz said, "I hope that others who deserve it also got it." When he was asked what the most important part of mechanism design is, he said welfare economics. The three Nobel prize winners used game theory work by mathematician John Forbes Nash, to discover the best way to reach a good outcome, without forgetting individual people. Mechanism design has been used as a guide for talks and taxation, voting and elections, to design auctions such as those for communications bandwidth, elections and labor talks and for pricing business stocks.

Professor Hurwicz was not able to attend the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm because of his age, Hurwicz received the prize in Minneapolis. Accompanied by Evelyn, his wife for sixty years, and his family, he was the most important guest at a meeting in the University of Minnesota with the university president Robert Bruininks. After watching the Nobel Prize awards ceremony on television, Jonas Hafstrom, the Swedish ambassador to the United States, awarded the Economics Prize to Professor Hurwicz.

Virtual private network

A virtual private network or VPN for short, is a way of connecting two computers through a network. Most people using computers connect to the World Wide Web using a normal network - they use dial-up or broadband. VPN is a little bit different, it is used by some workers to connect using a laptop to do work - they can check their work email and see work websites which can not be seen on the normal internet.

Dial-up

Dial-up internet access, usually just called Dial-up, is a slow way of connecting to the Internet by using a telephone line. A modem is connected between a computer and a telephone line and then the modem is instructed to dial the phone number of an Internet service provider (ISP) to connect to the Internet. The ISP must be a dial-up service provider with several dial-up modems waiting to accept dial-up calls. This kind of internet is slower than DSL. It is not widely used in the United States, where only one out of every ten people still use it.

For most countries in the world a dial-up service is available, using the laptop to call a local phone number that connects to the internet. Today it is also possible to use iPass with a wi-fi connection. 

The main benefit of iPass is that a single account can be used without setup almost anywhere in the world. It is possible to do the same thing by signing up for local services, but this can be quite hard to do. But it is not free to use and it is usually expensive compared to normal internet connections.

List of Renaissance artists

This a list of Renaissance artists begins in the 13th century (1200s) and includes famous painters and sculptors. 

Each artist is listed with their dates, place of birth, some places that they worked, their media (the type of artwork that they made), one or two most famous works and some art galleries where their works can be seen. 

These artists, before the Renaissance, painted in the style of Greek icons. Their paintings were important to the education of many Renaissance painters, and were to be seen in the churches where the Renaissance painters worked, and worshipped. Often an altarpiece by one of these artists was surrounded by frescoes by the Renaissance painters who lived 150 to 200 years later. A famous "Madonna and Child" by Coppo di Marcovaldo stood above the altar where Masaccio, Masolino and Filippo Lippi painted the walls of the Brancacci Chapel. Giotto, who is thought of as the first Renaissance painter, was educated by Cimabue, one of the great masters of the Late Byzantine style. 

Proto-Renaissance artists worked before 1400 in Italy when the Renaissance style was slowly developing. 

Artists from many parts of Europe worked in a decorative Gothic style.

It is known as the "granddaddy of them all" because it has been played every year since 1916. It is almost always played on January 1 after Pasadena's Rose Parade. For many years, the two teams who played were the winner of the Pac-10 (a football conference of colleges on the West Coast) and the winner of the Big 10 (a football conference of collleges in the Midwest). In 1998, the game became part of the Bowl Championship Series. USC has won the game 24 times.

The Uffizi Gallery (Italian: "Galleria degli Uffizi"), is one of the oldest and most famous art museums in the world. It is housed in the Palazzo degli Uffizi which means the "Palace of Offices" in Florence, Italy. 

In 1560, Cosimo I de' Medici, the Duke of Tuscany, ordered a design of new office buildings for the magistrates of Florence. This is why the building is called the ""Uffizi"" ("offices"). The designer was Giorgio Vasari and the buildings were continued by Alfonso Parigi and Bernardo Buontalenti and finished in 1581. 

The offices are in two parts which face each other across a cortyard. One end opens onto the town square and the other opens onto the River Arno. Varsari designed a sort of screen, like a backdrop in an Ancient Greek theatre. It has arches through which the view of the river can be seen. 

Duke Cosimo had a plan to arrange that finest works of art in the Medici families' collections on the upper floor. This was not done until the time of Francesco I. He also commissioned Buontalenti to design the most the famous room in the Uffizi, an octagonal room called the "Tribune of the Uffizi". This room contained many of the best paintings. Rich people would often send their sons on a "Grand Tour" of Europe. The Tribune of the Uffizi was one of the important sights on the tour. At first, people could only see the gallery by "request". (They would ask politely and perhaps be shown around.) The last Medici heiress, Anna Maria Lodovica, made an agreement with the city of Florence. In 1765 the Uffizi Gallery was officially opened to the public 

The collection of artworks is so large that some of the works are in other museums in Florence. Many of the statues are in the Bargello. Today the Uffizi is one of the most popular tourist attractions of Florence. In high season (particularly in July), people sometimes have to wait for five hours. 

Here are some of the famous paintings:

The collection also contains some famous ancient sculptures, such as the "Two Wrestlers".

Whitehall is a road in Westminster in London, England. It is the main street running north from Parliament Square, towards traditional Charing Cross, now at the southern end of Trafalgar Square and marked by the statue of Charles I, which is often regarded as the heart of London.

The name "Whitehall" is often used for governmental administration and as a geographic name for the district around it.

Whitehall was originally a wide road that ran up to the front of the palace. Trafalgar Square was built at its northern end in the early 19th century. The southernmost part by Parliament Square is named Parliament Street, but there is no longer any obvious difference between the two on the ground. Combined, the streets cover a total distance of about 0.6 mile (1 km).

Joseba Sarrionandia Uribelarrea (born April 13th 1958 in Iurreta, Biscay, Basque Country) is a Basque writer and a member of the Basque armed group ETA. He has written many poetry books, short stories, and novels. In 1985, Sarrionandia escaped from prison after he was put in for being a member of ETA. Since then, he has lived in secret but he still writes books. He is one of the best-known contemporary Basque writers.

Sarrionandia studied the Basque language and earned a PhD in Basque Philology from the University of Deusto in Bilbao. He was a Basque language teacher and taught phonetics. His writings were published in a number of Basque magazines. He also translated books by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Konstantino Kavafis, T. S. Eliot and Fernando Pessoa into the Basque language.

In 1980 Sarrionandia was arrested by Spanish police for being a member of ETA. He was sentenced to 22 years in prison. In 1985 he escaped from prison with Iñaki Pikaea during a concert in the jail with Basque singer Imanol Larzabal. They hid themselves inside a loudspeaker. The Basque rock group Kortatu wrote the song "Sarri, Sarri" in honor of this. He has lived in secret since his escape and writes a lot about exile. 

Sarrionandia has written books and poems which have been sung by different Basque singers. There's also an audio book called "Hau da ene ondasun guzia" of Sarrionandia reading his own poems as well as many songs performed by different singers.

Mosaic

Mosaic is the art of decorating a surface with pictures and patterns made of little pieces of stone, glass or tiles of different colours. Mosaics can be used indoors on walls, floors and ceilings. Mosaics are sometimes used outdoors on pavements. 

Mosaics are made by setting coloured pieces into "mortar" (cement) which sets hard and holds the pieces in place. Some mosaics are made of round pebbles, and have only two or three colours. Other mosaics are made of marble. Many mosaics, particularly in Italy, are made of terracotta tiles. (Terracotta is "fired" clay that has been baked in an oven.) Terracotta tiles come in many colours and can be used for colourful pictures as well as patterns. 

Some tiles look as if they are made of pure gold. These tiles are actually made of glass and have a very thin "leaf" of gold stuck to one side. The side with the gold gets put into the mortar. Then the gold can be seen through the glass, but cannot be scratched off.

Mosaics often last for a very long time. There are still plenty of mosaics which were made by the Ancient Romans. They can be seen in Italy, England, France, as well as other countries that were once part of the Roman Empire. 

Many beautiful mosaics date from the Early Christian and Byzantine eras, from about 300 AD to 1400, in Italy, Greece,and other countries. The mosaics in churches usually have pictures which tell Bible stories.

Mosaics were a popular way to decorate churches in Italy in the Medieval period. They were not popular in England, France, Germany and countries of Northern Europe because they preferred to use stained glass windows as decoration. In Italy, the most famous church with its interior decorated with mosaics is St. Mark's Basilica, Venice. At Westminster Cathedral in London, (which is built in an Italian style) the mosaic decoration which was started more than 100 years ago is still continuing, bit by bit. Many of the mosaics at St. Mark's and Westminster Cathedral have gold backgrounds. 

Nowadays mosaics are still used in all sorts of ways. Mosaics are most often used to brighten up public places in cities. Modern mosaics are made of all sorts of materials: mosaic tiles, bathroom tiles, broken roof tiles, broken dishes, broken mirrors, bits of metal and old bricks.

Odilon Redon

Odilon Redon (April 22, 1840 – July 6, 1916) was a Symbolist painter and printmaker, born in Bordeaux, Aquitaine, France.

Redon started drawing as a young child, and at the age of 10 he was given a drawing prize at school. At age 15, he began official study in drawing but he later on switched to architecture because his father told him to. His failure to pass the entrance exams at Paris’ École des Beaux-Arts ended any plans for a career as an architect, although he would later study there under Jean-Léon Gerôme.

Back home in his home town of Bordeaux, he took up sculpture, and Rodolphe Bresdin instructed him in etching and lithography. However, his artistic career was halted in 1870 when he joined the army to serve in the Franco-Prussian War.

At the end of the war, he moved to Paris, working almost only in charcoal and lithography. It would not be until 1878 that his work gained any recognition with "Guardian Spirit of the Waters", and he published his first album of lithographs, called "Dans le Rêve", in 1879. Still, Redon remained unknown until the appearance in 1884 of a cult novel by Joris-Karl Huysmans titled, "À rebours (Against Nature)". The story featured a decadent aristocrat who collected Redon's drawings. 

In the 1890s, he began to use pastel and oils, which featured in most of his works for the rest of his life. In 1899, he exhibited with the Nabis at Durand-Ruel's. In 1903 he was given the Legion of Honor. His popularity increased when a catalogue of etchings and lithographs was published by André Mellerio in 1913 and that same year, he was given the largest single representation at the New York Armory Show. 

In 2005 the Museum of Modern Art launched an exhibition called "Beyond The Visible", a comprehensive overview of Redon's work showcasing more than 100 paintings, drawings, prints and books from The Ian Woodner Family Collection. The exhibition ran from October 30, 2005 to January 23, 2006.

Pinniped

Pinnipeds are a group of semi-aquatic marine mammals, the seals and their relatives. The Pinnipedia is in the Order Carnivora. 
There are three Pinniped families: Odobenidae (walruses), Otariidae (eared seals, including sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae (true seals). So, seals and walruses are both pinnipeds. 

Pinnipeds are typically sleek-bodied and barrel-shaped. Their bodies are well adapted to the aquatic habitat where they spend most of their lives. Pinnipeds have flippers for hands, big bulky bodies, doggish faces, and big eyes. Unlike cetaceans, pinnipeds have their noses on their face, and each nostril of the nose closes when the pinniped goes under water. Like cetaceans, pinnipeds have a thick layer of blubber (fat) just under their skin: this blubber keeps them warm in cold waters and keeps them fed during times when food is not easily found. When they cannot find food, they live off the fat in the blubber.

Pinnipeds are carnivorous. This means they eat only meat (such as fish or squid) and not plants. However, almost all pinnipeds can be eaten by sharks or orca whales.

Pinnipeds are often trained in zoos or aquariums to put on shows, but in Sweden, it is illegal to train a seal to balance a ball on its nose.

<doc id="99877" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99877" title="Trojan asteroid">
Trojan asteroid

The Trojan asteroids are asteroids which orbit round the Sun in the same orbit and time as a planet.

The largest group of asteroids known to move around the Sun are those with the planet Jupiter. There are two groups of Jovian Trojans, one group on each side of Jupiter. 

In 1772 the French mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange identified two spots in a planet's orbit which were gravitationally stable. If put there, an object would stay there. Lagrange predicted the existence of a group of small bodies in each of the two stable points in Jupiter’s orbit. 

The term originally referred to the Trojan asteroids orbiting around Jupiter's Lagrangian points, which are by convention named after figures from the Trojan War of Greek mythology. By convention, the asteroids orbiting Jupiter's L point are named after the heroes from the Greek side of the war, while those at L are from the Trojan side. The two exceptions, the Greek-themed 617 Patroclus and the Trojan-themed 624 Hektor, were actually assigned to the wrong sides.

In 1904, Edward Emerson Barnard was the first person to see a Trojan asteroid. Barnard thought it was a moon of the planet Saturn. In February 1906 a German astronomer named Max Wolf saw a Trojan asteroid and named it 588 Achilles. Wolf was the first person to see a Trojan asteroid and know what it was. Since that time, more than 2000 Trojan asteroids have been seen. The biggest Trojan asteroid is named 624 Hektor. 624 Hektor is 370 km across. Astronomers think that Trojan asteroids are made of ice and dust. 

Later, objects were found orbiting the Lagrangian points of Neptune, Mars, and Earth. Asteroids at the Lagrangian points of planets other than Jupiter may be called Lagrangian asteroids.


Astronomers have found a Trojan asteroid not far from Earth, moving in the same orbit around the Sun. It sits in one of the 'Lagrange points', which are 60 degrees ahead of or behind the planets in their orbits. These are points of gravitational stability.

Called 2010 TK7, the rock is about 80 million km from Earth, and should come no closer than about 25 million km. The team says its orbit appears stable at least for the next 10,000 years.

It took an orbiting telescope sensitive to infrared light to pick up 2010 TK7. Wise, the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer launched in 2009, examined more than 500 Near-Earth objects (NEOs), 123 of which were new to science. Follow-up work on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope confirmed the status of 2010 TK7.

<doc id="99890" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99890" title="Green Lantern">
Green Lantern

Green Lantern is the name of several fictional superheroes that appear in comic books published by DC Comics. 

The first was Alan Scott and was created by writer Bill Finger and artist Martin Nodell in All-American Comics #16 in July 1940.

The most famous is Hal Jordan and was created by John Broome and Gil Kane in Showcase #22 in October 1959.

Each Green Lantern wears a power ring that allows the Green Lantern to control the physical world by strength of will.

Alan Scott was the Golden Age Green Lantern and his ring was powered by magic.

All of the Green Lanterns since then have worn rings that were not magic, but advanced technology. The Guardians of the Universe created the power rings and granted them to worthy candidates throughout the galaxy. These individuals make up the Green Lantern Corps, an intergalactic police force.

Alan Scott was a young engineer when he found a metal lantern that glowed with a magical green flame. The flame told Alan how to build a ring. Alan used the power of the ring to fight crime. Alan was a founding member of the Justice Society of America.

Alan Scott's power ring had to be recharged every 24 hours and did not work on wood.

Hal Jordan was an airplane test pilot. Jordan was given his power ring by a dying alien named Abin Sur, whose spaceship had crashed on Earth. Jordan was a founding member of the Justice League of America and also a member of the Green Lantern Corps.

Hal Jordan's ring initially did not work on anything the color yellow.

Hal Jordan's hometown Coast City was destroyed in the early 1990s and he went insane. Jordan destroyed the Green Lantern Corps and renamed himself Parallax. Jordan later died, sacrificing himself to reignite a dying Sun only to return from the grave as the Spectre, the divine Spirit of God's Vengeance.

Hal Jordan was eventually revived and once again became a Green Lantern. He also made an oath to recharge the power ring:<br>
"In brightest day, in blackest night<br>
No evil shall escape my sight,<br>
Let those who worship evil's might,<br>
Beware my power...Green lantern's light!"

Guy Gardner

Guy Gardner was the second choice of Abin Sur and the backup to Hal Jordan.

John Stewart

John Stewart, an architect, was chosen by the Guardians to replace Guy Gardner as the backup Green Lantern for Hal Jordan.

Kyle Rayner

Kyle Rayner, a freelance artist, was given the last power ring, and restored the Guardians and Corps after Jordan destroyed them as Parallax. Later Kyle became Ion, the manifestation of willpower, for a short time.

August Kopff

August Kopff (February 5 1882–April 25 1960) was a German astronomer who found many comets and asteroids.

He found some comets, such as the periodic comet 22P/Kopff and the non-periodic C/1906 E1.

He found many asteroids, such as the notable Trojan asteroids 617 Patroclus and 624 Hektor.

A crater on the Moon is named after him: see Kopff (crater).

Even though later astronomers tried to find it again, it has not been reliably seen since. Notably, an imaging sequence covering an entire orbital period at 4 km resolution taken on 15 November, 2004 failed to find the object. This suggests that it was a clump of material that had disappeared by that time.

Another object, , was seen nearby 5 hours later, but this time just "inside" the F Ring. Because of the different location of the second object, it was given a fresh designation, although their interpretation as a single object on a F-ring crossing orbit is also possible. Such an object might also be orbiting at a bit different inclination to the F ring, thereby not actually passing through the ring material even though it was being seen both radially inward and outward of it.

If a solid object after all, would be 3−5 km in diameter based on brightness, and might be a shepherd satellite for the farther edge of Saturn's F ring.

Even though astronomers tried to find it again, it has not been reliably seen since. Notably, an imaging sequence covering an entire orbital period at 4 km resolution taken on 15 November, 2004 failed to find the object. This suggests that it was a clump of material that had disappeared by that time.

An interpretation where S3 and S4 are or were a single object on a F-ring crossing orbit is also possible.

It was first seen by scientists in pictures taken by the Cassini-Huygens probe on October 28, 2004, and announced on 8 November that year. It appears to be the best tracked object in this area with at least five possible sightings in the period till late 2005. In comparison, two objects in the F ring's area ( and ) that were first seen months earlier have not been found again with any confidence. Nevertheless, it continues to be unclear whether there is a solid core to or whether it is just a dust clump that will disappear in years or months. Notably, an imaging sequence covering an entire orbital period at 4 km resolution taken on 15 November, 2004 (soon after 's discovery) failed to find the object, while it has been seen again later. The lighting conditions in 's part of the orbit were different during these two sightings, however, with the discovery being made when the area was strongly backlit by the sun. A suggested resolution of the absence in November is that 's visibility is primarily due to a diffuse cloud of fine dust that is much brighter in forward scattered light (the conditions of the discovery image), and that the solid core (if any) is small.

The dusty halo seen in pictures is big, being around 2000 km in lengthwise extent. The solid object, if any, would be no bigger than 3−5 km in diameter based on brightness.

<doc id="99925" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99925" title="Imaginary number">
Imaginary number

Imaginary numbers are numbers that are made from combining a real number with the imaginary unit, called "i", where "i" is defined as formula_1. They are defined separately from the negative real numbers in that they are a square root of a negative real number instead of a positive real number.

The square root of a negative number presents a problem for mathematicians. The square root of 9 is three, but the square root of −9 is not −3. This is because −3 x −3 = +9, not −9. For a long time it seemed as though there was no answer to the square root of −9.

This is why mathematicians invented the imaginary number, "i", and said that it is the square root of −1. The square root of −1 is not a real number, so this definition creates a new type of number, just like fractions create numbers like 2/3 that are not counting numbers like 4 or 10, and negative numbers let us have numbers less than 0. Sometimes, mathematicians seem rather comfortable using a number that is so unusual, but the name "imaginary" should not fool you because "i" is as valid a number as 3 or 145,329.

It may seem that a number that was basically made up by mathematicians would have no use in the world. However, many branches of science and engineering have found uses for this number. Sometimes electrical engineers need "i" to understand how an electric circuit will work when they are designing it. Certain branches of physics such as quantum physics and high energy physics use "i" as often as they use any other regular number. Many equations in the world simply cannot be solved without "i". 

Imaginary numbers can be mixed with numbers we are more familiar with. For example a real number such as "2" can be added to an imaginary number such as "3i" to create "2+3i". These kinds of mixed numbers are known as "complex numbers".

Eric Maskin

Eric Stark Maskin (born December 12, 1950) is an American economist who won a Nobel prize with Leonid Hurwicz and Roger Myerson, for economics in 2007. He is the Albert O. Hirschman Professor of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study, and a visiting Professor at Princeton University.

Maskin was born in New York City, New York on December 12, 1950, to a non-religious Jewish family, and grew up in Alpine, New Jersey. He graduated from Tenafly High School in Tenafly, New Jersey in 1968, and then studied at Harvard University where he received his A.B. and Ph.D. After he got his Ph.D., Maskin went to the University of Cambridge in 1976 where he was a research fellow at Cambridge College. He taught at Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1977-1984 and from 1985-2000 at Harvard, where he was the Louis Berkman Professor of Economics. In 2000, he moved to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

He has studied a wide range of subjects in economic theory, such as game theory, the economics of incentives, and contract theory. He is particularly well known for his work on mechanism design/implementation theory and dynamic games. His current research projects include comparing different rules for elections, the causes of inequality and studying coalition formation. He is a Fellow of the "American Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Econometric Society", and the "European Economic Association", and a Corresponding Fellow of the "British Academy". He was president of the "Econometric Society" in 2003.

Maskin suggested that software patents make new inventions difficult. Software, semiconductor, and computer industries have made many inventions in the past when patent laws have been weak, he argued. "In the 1980s when patent protection was extended to software," wrote Maskin. "Arguments predicted that productivity should have increased among patenting firms." Maskins ideas that this would not happen were correct. "These increases did not occur."

Mario Capecchi

Mario Renato Capecchi (born 6 October 1937) is an Italian-born American molecular geneticist. He won the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Sir Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies. 

Capecchi is Distinguished Professor of Human Genetics and Biology at the University of Utah School of Medicine, which he joined in 1973.

Mario Capecchi was born in the Italian city of Verona in 1937. His father, Luciano Capecchi, was an Italian airman who was reported as missing in action in the Western Desert Campaign. His mother was called Lucy Ramberg. Lucy was an American-born daughter of Impressionist painter Lucy Dodd Ramberg and German archaeologist Walter Ramberg. During World War II, his mother was sent to the Dachau concentration camp as punishment for handing out pamphlets and belonging to an anti-Fascist group. Before her arrest she had sold her belongings and gave the money to a poor family near Bolzano, to give her son a place to live. After one year, the money was all spent and the family was unable to care for him. At four-and-a-half years old he was left to live on the streets of northern Italy for the next four years, living in various orphanages and roving through towns with groups of other homeless children.

He almost died of hunger. His mother had been freed from Dachau and began a year-long search for him. She finally found him in a hospital bed in Reggio Emilia, ill with a fever and living one bowl of chicory coffee and bread crust each day. She took him to Rome, where he had his first bath in six years.

In 1946 his uncle, Edward Ramberg, an American physicist at RCA, sent his mother money to return to the United States. Mario and his mother moved to Pennsylvania to live at a cooperative community which had been started by his uncle. 

In 1960 Capecchi came to MIT as a graduate student to study physics and mathematics, but he soon became interested in molecular biology. He moved to Harvard to join the laboratory of James D. Watson, co-discoverer of the shape of DNA. Capecchi received his PhD in biophysics in 1967 from Harvard University.

In 1973 he joined the faculty at the University of Utah. Since 1988 Capecchi has also been an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He has taught for Duke University's Program in Genetics and Genomics.

After the Nobel committee announced that Capecchi had won the Nobel prize, an Austrian woman named Marlene Bonelli claimed that Capecchi was her long-lost half-brother, which he acknowledged was true.

Mario Capecchi is known for his new work in gene targeting of the mouse embryonic stem cells which helped him study other transgenic technologies such as cloning and genetic changing. The work on gene targeting and knockout mice won the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded jointly with Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies.

Dr. Capecchi has also pursued a systematic analysis of the mouse Hox gene family. This gene family is used to control embryonic development in all multicellular animals.

Warp technology

Warp Technology is fictional technology created within science fiction. It is a way of moving objects faster than the speed of light. There are many examples of how this idea is used. A well known one is found in the Star Trek universe where faster-than-light travel is needed to tell the story. 

Current technology does not allow anything or anyone to go at, or faster than, the speed of light. Unless the current theories are proven wrong, this will always be true. However warp technology as a fictional idea has been an interesting way of shaping the story line to let spaceships move at speeds greater than 186,000 miles per second (speed of light through a vacuum - the known limit of speed in the universe).

Warp technology allows ships move at warp speed. In the Star Trek universe for example the actual speed the ship is moving is called the warp factor (although thrusters and impulse power propel spaceships at sub-light speed). Warp speed ranges from warp factor 1 (the speed of light) up to warp factor 9.99. In some circumstances Star Trek spaceships can go faster than warp 10, although rare.

Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters (September 19, 1813–July 18, 1890) was a German-American astronomer, and one of the first to find asteroids. 

He was born in Schleswig-Holstein, then part of Denmark but later part of Germany, and later studied under Carl Friedrich Gauss. He spoke many languages and spent time in Italy and Ottoman Turkey before going to the United States in 1854.

Working at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York (near Utica), he was a good finder of asteroids, finding 48 of them, beginning with 72 Feronia in 1861 and ending with 287 Nephthys in 1889.

He was involved in litigation in 1889 with his old assistant Charles A. Borst, and the "Great Star-Catalog Case" "Peters v. Borst" went before the Supreme Court of New York. The judge sided with Peters, but many astronomers and newspapers sided with Borst. Peters died not long after. After his death, the judgement was ultimately reversed on appeal and a new trial was ordered, but it never took place.

Besides asteroids, he co-found the periodic comet 80P/Peters-Hartley, and also found different nebulae and galaxies.

<doc id="99986" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99986" title="Soest, Germany">
Soest, Germany

Soest (pronounced ) is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is the capital of the Soest district.

Soest is along the "Hellweg" road, about 50 kilometres east of Dortmund and about 50 kilometres west of Paderborn.


Due to the fertile soil the area around Soest was used long before 836 when the village is first mentioned in the "Dagobertsche Schenkung", although the origin of this document is historically unknown. But there is no doubt that Soest has been lived in for a long time; excavations in the last two decades have uncovered signs of people living in Soest more than 4000 years ago. In the 11th and 12th century Soest grew a lot, making it one of the biggest cities in Westphalia with some 10,000 citizens. It was also an important member of the Hanseatic League until 1609.

A self-confident Soest from 1444 to 1449 freed itself from the Bishop of Cologne, who controlled Westphalia (the so-called ""). Being no longer capital of Westphalia, the city aligned itself with the Duke of Cleves. This was a Pyrrhic victory, however; the city had shown itself strong enough to defy the powerful Archbishop of Cologne, but lost much of its trade: the "freed" town was two-thirds surrounded by territories with other rulers. When the last Duke of Cleves died in 1609 that dukedom was taken by Brandenburg and after a short siege Soest was added into it. During and after the Thirty Years' War, Soest lossed a lot of people and influence; at the lowest point in 1756 it had only 3,600 citizens.

With the start of the Soest district in 1817 its influence slowly rose. However, the industrialization of the Ruhr area did not reach Soest, which continued to be a small city.

From about 1953 to 1971 there was a big garrison of Canadian soldiers and their families stationed at Soest (with the Canadian camps just east of the city in Bad Sassendorf) as well as Werl and Hemer-Iserlohn and Deilinghofen to the south west. There were also many Belgian Kasernes located in Soest itself. 

From 1971-1993 the old Canadian properties, such as the Married Quarters along Hiddingser Weg, south of the B-1, were used by British military and families. Upon the closing out of Belgian and British army facilities many of these military facilities either became used for civilian purposes or were not used again/destroyed. The old Married Quarters area was changed to civilian housing. The old CANEX (formerly MLS) (the Canadian Army's food and clothing store for dependent families) was changed to a NAAFI under the British and was finally demolished in 2006.

In 960, Bruno I, Archbishop of Cologne moved St Patroclus's relics from Troyes and buried them in 964 at St Patroclus's Cathedral in Soest, where he is still today honoured.

The Cathedral is a beautiful example of early medieval "Romanesque" architecture fashioned from the local greenish sandstone. Its big squared bell tower or steeple can be seen for many kilometers, rising up out of the city centre of the old city and a landmark of the Soester Boerde.

The coat of arms shows a key, which is the symbol for Saint Peter, the patron of Cologne. The coat was not changed even after Soest no longer fell within the jurisdiction of Cologne.

History of Europe

The history of Europe means all the time when humans lived in the European continent up to the present day. 

The first evidence of Homo sapiens in Europe dates back to 35,000 BC. Europe's antiquity (ancient time) dates from Homer's "Iliad" in Ancient Greece of around 700 BC. The Roman Republic was established in 509 BC, which was usurped by Octavian's new Roman Empire at its first century peak. The Christian religion was adopted in the fourth century, and in the sixth was organized, within the Empire, by Emperor Justinian I (527–565) with five most important cities: Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria. The fall of the Western Roman Empire was followed by a decline of Western Europe. The Byzantine Empire kept civilization in the East. A schism within the church's authority in 1054 was added to the earlier division that had persisted since 451 and was followed by Crusades from west to rescue the east from Muslim invasion. Feudal society began to break down, as the Mongol invaders carried the Black Death with them. Constantinople fell in 1453, yet the new world was discovered in 1492. Europe awoke from the medieval period through rediscovery of classical learning. The Renaissance was followed by the Protestant Reformation, as German priest Martin Luther attacked Papal authority. The Thirty Years War, the Treaty of Westphalia and the Glorious Revolution laid the basis for a new era of expansion and enlightenment.

The Industrial Revolution, beginning in Great Britain, allowed people for the first time to break from material subsistence. The early British Empire split as its colonies in America revolted to establish a representative government. Political change in continental Europe was spurred by the French Revolution, as people cried out for "liberté, egalité, fraternité". The French leader, Napoleon Bonaparte, conquered and reformed the social structure of the continent through war up to 1815. As more and more small property holders were granted the vote, in France and the UK, socialist and trade union activity developed and revolution gripped Europe in 1848. The last vestiges of serfdom were abolished in Austria-Hungary in 1848. Russian serfdom was abolished in 1861. The Balkan nations began to regain their independence from the Ottoman Empire. After the Franco-Prussian War, Italy and Germany were formed from the groups of principalities in 1870 and 1871. Conflict spread across the globe, in a chase for empires, until the search for a place in the sun ended with the outbreak of World War I. In the desperation of war, the Russian Revolution promised the people "peace, bread and land". The defeat of Germany came at the price of economic destruction, codified into the Treaty of Versailles, manifested in the Great Depression and the return to a Second World War. After this war Communism spread to Central and Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, North Vietnam and North Korea. 
This led to the Cold War, a forty-year argument between the United States, the Soviet Union, and their allies (mainly countries that were members of NATO or the Warsaw Pact). Each country wanted to promote their type of government. The Soviet Union wanted to spread communism, and the United States wanted to spread democracy. People across the world feared a nuclear war because of the tension. 

Communism became less attractive when it became clear that it could promote economic growth less effectively than then Western states and that it was not suited for a reform that allowed freedom of speech for everybody. Therefore the Soviet Union forced in Hungary to give up its reform in 1956, it favoured the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and it stopped reform in Czechoslovakia in 1968. When in 1988/89 Gorbachev made clear that he would not force the countries of the East block to stick to Communism the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989 and the Soviet Union collapsed (1991). Then the United States was the only superpower left.
Europe signed a new treaty of union, which included 27 European countries in 2007.

Peace of Westphalia

The Peace of Westphalia refers to the pair of treaties, the Treaty of Osnabrück and the Treaty of Münster, signed on May 15 and October 24 of 1648, which ended both the Thirty Years' War and the Eighty Years' War. The treaties involved the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand III Habsburg, the other German princes, Spain, France, Sweden and representatives of the Dutch Republic. The Treaty of the Pyrenees, signed in 1659, ending the war between France and Spain, is also often considered part of the overall accord.

The peace negotiations were held in the cities of Münster and Osnabrück, which lie about 50 km apart from each other, in the present day German states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony. Sweden had favoured Osnabrück due to its Protestant background, France chose Münster due to its Catholic background. In any case two locations were required because Protestant and Catholic leaders refused to meet each other. The Catholics used Münster, while the Protestants used Osnabrück.

The power which Ferdinand III had taken for himself against the Holy Roman Empire's constitution was stripped. That meant that the rulers of the German states were again able to determine the religion of their lands. 

There were also territorial adjustments.

Battle of Antietam

The Battle of Antietam (also known as the Battle of Sharpsburg, particularly in the South) was a battle fought on September 17, 1862. It happened near Sharpsburg, Maryland. It was the first major battle in the American Civil War to happen in the northern states. It was the bloodiest single-day battle in American history. Around 23,000 soldiers were killed or wounded in this battle.

After pursuing Confederate General Robert E. Lee into Maryland, Union Army Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan launched attacks against Lee's army, in defensive positions behind Antietam Creek. At dawn on September 17, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's corps mounted a powerful assault on Lee's left flank. Attacks and counterattacks swept across Miller's cornfield and fighting swirled around the Dunker Church. Union assaults against the Sunken Road eventually pierced the Confederate center, but the Federal advantage was not followed up. In the afternoon, Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside's corps entered the action, capturing a stone bridge over Antietam Creek and advancing against the Confederate right. At a crucial moment, Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill's division arrived from Harpers Ferry and launched a surprise counterattack, driving back Burnside and ending the battle. Although outnumbered two-to-one, Lee committed his entire force, while McClellan sent in less than three-quarters of his army, enabling Lee to fight the Federals to a standstill. During the night, both armies consolidated their lines. In spite of crippling casualties, Lee continued to skirmish with McClellan throughout September 18, while removing his battered army south of the river.

Despite having superiority of numbers, McClellan's attacks failed to achieve concentration of mass, allowing Lee to counter by shifting forces along interior lines to meet each challenge. Despite ample reserve forces that could have been deployed to exploit localized successes, McClellan failed to destroy Lee's army. Nevertheless, Lee's invasion of Maryland was ended, and he was able to withdraw his army back to Virginia without interference from the cautious McClellan. There is now an Antietam Memorial Illumination sponsored by volunteers. It is a project where they light a candle for every casualty. The union had a strategic win over the Confederates.

Old French

Old French was the Romance dialect continuum spoken in the northern half of modern France and parts of modern Belgium and Switzerland from around 1000 to 1300. It was then known as the langue d'oïl (Oil languages). This was different from the langue d'oc (Occitan language, also then called Provençal), whose territory bordered that of Old French to the south.

The Old Frankish language had a large influence on the vocabulary of Old French after the conquest, by the tribe of the Franks, of the portions of Roman Gaul that are now France and Belgium during the Migration Period.

Deborah Sampson

Deborah Sampson was a woman that dressed as a man, so that she could join the American soldiers in the Revolutionary War. (The Revolutionary War was a war between Great Britain and the Thirteen Original colonies.) 

Deborah Sampson came from a poor family. She worked as an indentured servant from the age of eight to the age of eighteen. She worked for no pay for a family, but that family let her study with and spend time with their sons.

She served in the Army for a little more than a year. She got hurt in a battle. She got hit by swords and guns. After the war she got a very bad fever. The doctor that cared for her found out that she was a woman. He told her that she would have to leave the army and go home. 

Yet, she re-entered the war. On the other hand, her doctor gave her a letter to take to General George Washington when she got better. Washington gave her a letter that said that she had to leave. But the said that served in the war with honor.

She later got married. She worked as a teacher. She also spoke in public about her experiences in the war.

Council of Trent

Council of Trent was the 19th Ecumenical council of the Roman Catholic Church. Important members of the Catholic Church met in Trento three times between December 13, 1545, and December 4, 1563, as a reaction to the Protestant Reformation. It stated current Catholic doctrines on salvation, the sacraments, and the Biblical canon, it answered all Protestant disputes. 

The council often could not meet when they wanted to, and sometimes could not meet at all, because of resistance from the popes and revolt against the emperor. Emperor Charles V wanted the council to meet, and Pope Paul III summoned the council in 1537, but the plans fell through. In 1538, ideas for a council again failed. The pope asked for the council to meet in 1542, but it did not actually meet until 1545. The council was not active from 1547 and 1551. It again met from 1551 to 1552, when it was suspended due to a revolt against the emperor. Pope Paul IV (1555-1559) strongly disliked Protestant ideas and the council could not start again until his succesor took office. The council met for the last time from 1562 to 1563.

The Council of Trent was part of the Counter-Reformation. It would be over 300 years until the next Ecumenical Council.

Pope Paul III saw that the Protestant Reformation was growing in size. Before, a small number of priests were part of the reformation, but soon many princes, particularly in Germany, supported its ideas. Therefore Pope Paul III desired a council. 
But the council could not meet until 1545, and met right before Luther's death. The council was moved to Bologna in March, 1547 with the excuse of avoiding a plague; without any plans to meet again, September 17th, 1549. 
The council was reopened at Trento, May 1, 1551, by Pope Julius III (1550–55); broken up 1552, recalled by Pope Pius IV (1559–65) for the last time, January 18, 1562, when it continued until December 4, 1563. 

Objects were:

1. To stop the ideas and practice of Protestantism and to support the Catholic Church's ideas.

2. To change the parts of the church and actions of church leaders that damaged or hurt the Catholic Church's ideas and image. 

The results were:

1. The church's interpretation of the Bible was final. Any Christian who did not agree with the interpretation was a heretic. Also, the Bible and Church Tradition had equal authority.

2. The relationship of faith and works in salvation was defined, following disagreements over Martin Luther's doctrine of "justification by faith alone".

3. Catholic practices such as Indulgences, pilgrimages, the veneration of saints and relics, and the veneration of the Virgin Mary were strongly reaffirmed.

The doctrinal decisions of the council are divided into decrees ("decreta"), which contain the positive statement of the conciliar dogmas, and into short canons ("canones"), which condemn the differing Protestant views with the concluding ""anathema sit"" ("let him be anathema").

Gospel of Matthew

The Gospel of Matthew is a book of the Bible. It is one of the four gospels of the New Testament that tell the story of the life and teachings of Jesus. "Matthew's Gospel" is placed first because that's how God wanted it to be. However, it is not believed to be the first one that was written. It is believed that it was written by the Apostle Matthew, who was also called Levi. Matthew was one of the Twelve apostles of Jesus. The Gospel of Matthew is called one of the synoptic gospels because it has some of the same stories and language as the Gospels of Mark and Luke.

Matthew wrote the Gospel mainly for the Jewish people, to show them that Jesus is really the Messiah. Matthew's gospel is similar to both Mark's gospel and Luke's gospel, and contains many stories about Jesus' life which are very alike. Matthew's gospel has many references to Jewish scripture.

The Gospel of Mark is a book of the Bible. It is the second book of the New Testament and comes after the Gospel of Matthew even though it may have been written before it. The writer is believed to have been John Mark, a friend of Simon Peter, who was one of the Twelve apostles of Jesus. 

The four gospels tell the story of the life of Jesus. The word "gospel" means "good news". The Gospel of Mark moves quickly, and the story shows how much Jesus worked during his short 3-year ministry. Mark's gospel tells many things about Jesus which are also found in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke.

Gospel of Luke

The Gospel of Luke is a book of the Bible. Like the other gospels, the "Gospel of Luke" tells the stories of the life and teachings of Jesus. It is the third book of the New Testament and comes after the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Mark. The gospel is believed to be written by Luke, who was a friend of the Apostle Paul. 

Luke was a doctor. He wrote his gospel for a man called Theophilus. Luke wrote another book which is fifth in the New Testament, the Acts of the Apostles which tells what Jesus's disciples did after his rise back to Heaven.

Unlike the gospel writers Matthew, Mark and John, Luke was probably not Jewish but was Greek. He wrote the gospel mainly for non-Jewish people, (who were called Gentile by the Jews). Luke wrote to prove that Jesus is the Son of God. Luke's gospel contains many similar stories of Jesus. He tells more about the birth of Jesus than the other gospel writers.

Gospel of John

The Gospel of John is a book of the Bible. It is one of the four "gospels" at the beginning of the New Testament. The four gospels tell the story of the life of Jesus. The "Gospel of John" is the fourth book of the New Testament, after the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke.

In the gospel, it is says that the book was written by "the disciple whom Jesus loved". It is believed that John the Apostle, the son of Zebedee, wrote the gospel. He was probably the youngest of the Twelve apostles of Jesus. John lived a long life and was imprisoned on the Island of Patmos in his old age. He also wrote the last book of the New Testament, called the "Book of Revelation". 

The Gospel of John tells many of the stories of Jesus' life that are in the other three gospels, but also contains a lot of different information. The Gospel begins by calling Jesus "the Word" (the Communication of God). It says ""In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God."" In John's Gospel, the writer shows that Jesus was part of God, who came to live among humanity so that they could "hear His voice" and have the power to become true "children of God". 

According to the gospel, the accounts are written so that the reader ""may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name"". (TNIV; John 20:31)

There is some disagreement over whether the John who wrote the letters of John, the John who wrote The Gospel of John, and the John who wrote the Book of Revelation are the same person.

Epistle to the Romans

The Epistle to the Romans or Letter to the Romans, is one of the letters written by Apostle Paul to a church elsewhere. Here, the letter is addressed to the early Church in Rome.

Paul wrote the letter to the Romans to explain a very important point in Christianity. He proves, by quoting the Old Testament, that all humankind is guilty of sin before God. People whom God calls righteous can only do so by trusting in God's ways, and not by their own effort. 

Only by believing in Jesus, who is the Christ and who died for humanity for their sins, can people be saved.

Once this belief is had, the believer receives the Holy Spirit, who helps the believer live a new life. Paul asks the Romans to observe Christian ethics and submit themselves to authorities.

The letter remains very influential in explaining to non-Christians and new Christians what their Christian belief is all about.

First Epistle to the Corinthians

The First Epistle to the Corinthians, or the First Letter to the Corinthians, is a long letter written by the Apostle Paul to the church in Corinth.

Paul wrote to the Corinthian church for a number of reasons. He realizes the church at Corinth is divided and explains that although himself and a few disciples had helped start the church, the church was really headed by Christ Jesus Himself. "I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow." (TNIV) 

Paul scolds the church members there for sexual immorality and asks for these immoral people to be thrown out of the church. 

He gives instructions for marriage, against worshipping worthless idols (idolatory), for spiritual gifts like prophecy. Paul praises the superior way of love and urges the church to be united. 

At the end, Paul states that the resurrection of Christ is true. He supports it with testimonies from "more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters" and it is this very truth which makes certain the believers will have eternal life.

Finally Paul tells of his plans to visit the Corinthians, and that Timothy, his co-worker, is coming to their church very soon.

The Epistle to the Hebrews or Letter to the Hebrews is one of the letters of the New Testament. Although it is believed by many to be written by the Apostle Paul, many others think it might have been written by one group of early Christians to a general group of Jews (also called Hebrews), or to a church with Jewish members.

The letter explains that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the perfect sacrifice for human sinners. He is superior to angels and is our High priest in the order of Melchizedek. Jesus is the Messiah whose coming gives us the superior New Covenant, as compared to the Old Covenant of Abraham. The writers state that if the Old Covenant was faultless, God would not have sent his Son to start a new one.

By stating that people are called righteous through their faith and belief in God's ways, the writers urge the readers to receive God's grace by accepting Jesus Christ.

C-rock

C-rock is short for Chinese rock music. C-rock (中国摇滚 zhōng guó yáo gǔn or 中国摇滚音乐 zhōng guó yáo gǔn yīn yuè; literally "Chinese shaking and rolling music") can be performed in any dialect of Chinese language. Some people consider C-rock a subgenre of C-pop.

The history of C-rock before the 1980s is very unclear though it is believed to have existed in the 1970s or even the 1960s.
The first clear sign of Chinese rock was the 西北风 Xi Bei Feng (literally Northwest Wind). Xi Bei Feng is style of folk-influenced punk music, originating from the northwestern area of China, such as the Shanxi and Gansu provinces. . The new style was triggered by two new songs, "信天游 Xin Tian You" and "一无所有". As time passed, Xi Bei Feng became stronger, more fast-tempo and aggressive. In contrast to the mellow C-pop style, XBF songs were sung loudly and forcefully.

Many XBF songs chanllenged political views, reflected unhappiness among Chinese youth and individuality and self-empowerment. Both music and lyrics articulated a sense of pride in the power of the northwest's peasantry. Songs such as "妹妹你大胆的往前走" came to represent an earthy, primordial masculine image of China, as opposed to the soft, sweet, polished urban gang tai style.

囚歌, also known as Prison songs or Prison rock, became popular in the late 1980s. Prison rock was more folk-like than the XBF style. Prison rock was led & created by 迟志强 Chi Zhi Qiang, who wrote lyrics about his time in jail and set them to folk melodies from northeast China. In contrast to Northwest Wind songs, prison songs were slow and "weepy", and were characterised by the rude&vulgar language and lyrics showing pessimism, despair, anticonformity and cynicism.

The birthplace of Chinese rock was Beijing. Rock and roll was not common until the late 1980s. Some rebellious trends from punk XBF were revived. In 1989 and 1990, rock and roll came into mainstream music as a combination of the Northwest Wind and prison song fads. 

After the protests in Tiananmen Square rock and roll became part of general urban youth culture in China. Its popularity growth celebrated on 17 and 18 February 1990 when Beijing's largest rock concert was held in the Capital Gymnasium. The concert featured six rock bands.

Chinese rock and roll's peak popularity was between 1990 and 1993. Many rock bands were established and rock music was performed regularly. Rock and roll was not approved of by the Chinese government because many performers had anti-conformist behaviour. The government made sure that rock and roll was not to be broadcast on CCTV, so the main venues remained to be informal, underground rock parties. Some fans and performers had characteristics such as long hair for males, jeans, silver metal ornaments, black leather coats and hippie-style behaviour.

By 1994, rock and roll slowly began to decline. One of the reasons is because of the censorship by the Communist Party of China, such as the banning of rock from television and restrictions on performances. The main reason, however, is the general lack of interest in anti-conformist and anti-Government thoughts and behaviour. In the mid 1990s, people became more interested in C-pop and newer stars at the time such as Andy Lau and the Four Heavenly Kings of Cantonese pop.

From 2000 to 2004, rock in China grew in popularity again, influenced by Japanese rock trends, including pop-rock, Visual kei and Gothic Lolitta and some American rock music styles such as light rock, soft rock, piano rock, post-grunge and alternative rock.

Another important step in the development of Chinese rock music is the Beijing Midi School of Music in Beijing. Established 1993 by Zhang Fan, it was the first school in China offering classes specialising in jazz and rock music. Started as a festival in 1999, the Midi Modern Music Festival became the largest rock music festival in China. Both the school and the festival supported the underground scene in China and allowed foreign bands in 2006 to perform at the festival and throughout the country, including Alev, Monokino, YMA and The Wombats .

In addition to the Midi school, the goth rock magazine Painkiller Magazine brought bands such as Edguy, Lacrimosa and Hatesphere to fame in China.

Rubber mold

A mold consists of two plates and alighment pins for a sure fit.The upper and lower plate each having grooves and recesses for the actual product and the excess material. Products such as o-rings and tires are made using such molds. Molds can vary greatly in sixe from a few inches across the several feet across and weighing thousands of pounds. They are usually made of hardened steel for wear resistance.

Compression molds work by taking the empty mold and placing a piece of unshaped rubber inside. The mold is then pressed shut using high heat and pressure forcing the rubber to liquify and flow into the recess created for the part while excess rubber is forced into the molds dump groove. It is important when making a mold to keep in mind that when the part cools it will shrink slightly.

Injection molds work under the same principle as compression molds except that instead of pressing the mold together on the rubber the mold is first closed and the liquid rubber is then injected into a fill hole drilled into the mold. This is used more for plastic products.

The Reformed churches are a group of Christian Protestant denominations that are historically related by a doctrine that is identical or similar to Calvinism. It developed in the Swiss Reformation led by Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin, but soon afterwards appeared in nations throughout Western Europe. Each nation in which the Reformed movement was originally established had its own church government. Several of these local churches have expanded to worldwide denominations and most have experienced splits into multiple denominations. 

The first Reformed Churches were established in Europe in the 1500s, in the wake of the Protestant Reformation.

Reformed doctrine is expressed in various texts]. Some of them are used by many denominations. Different denominations use different confessions, usually based on historical reasons. Some of the confessions still commonly in use are (with year of writing):

Norbert Brainin

Norbert Brainin (March 12, 1923 – April 10 2005) was the first violinist of the Amadeus Quartet, one of the world's most highly regarded string quartets.

Because of Brainin's Jewish origin, he was driven out of Vienna after Hitler's Anschluss of 1938, as were the violinist Siegmund Nissel and violist Peter Schidlof. Brainin and Schidlof met in a British internment camp, many Jewish refugees having had the misfortune of being confined by the British as "enemy aliens" upon seeking refuge in the UK

Brainin was released after a few months, but Schidlof remained in the camp, where he met Nissel. Finally Schidlof and Nissel were released, and the three of them were able to study with violin pedagogue Max Rostal, who taught them free of charge. It was through Rostal that they met cellist Martin Lovett, and in 1947 they formed the Brainin Quartet, which was renamed the Amadeus Quartet in 1948.

The Amadeus was one of the most celebrated quartets of the 20th Century, and its members were awarded numerous honours, including: 


The quartet disbanded in 1987 upon the death of Schidlof, who was regarded as irreplaceable by other members. Norbert Brainin continued to perform as a soloist, often performing with pianist Günter Ludwig.

His instruments included the "Rode" Guarnerius del Gesu of 1734, the "Chaconne" Stradivarius of 1725 and the "Gibson" Stradivarius of 1713.

Amadeus Quartet

The Amadeus Quartet was a world famous string quartet founded in 1947. First violin - Norbert Brainin, second violin - Siegmund Nissel, viola - Peter Schidlof, cello - Martin Lovett.

Violinists Norbert Brainin, Siegmund Nissel and Peter Schidlof were forced to leave Vienna for London because of their Jewish origin after Hitler's Anschluss of 1938. When World War II broke out they were sent to internment camps because they were "enemy aliens" (foreigners from a country that Britain was fighting against). The three violinists met up in camp and spent a lot of time playing music together. Soon they were set free because they were "distinguished artists" (actually they were unknown at the time). They studied with violin teacher Max Rostal, who taught them free of charge. Another student of Rostal was Suzanne Rozsa, who was married to the cellist Martin Lovett. Peter Schidlof changed to playing the viola, and they played string quartets together. In 1947 they formed the Brainin Quartet. Nissel then thought of the name "Amadeus Quartet". He thought it sounded better than calling the group by the name of the first violinist. The quartet was renamed the Amadeus Quartet in 1948 (Amadeus was one of Mozart's names). 

The group gave its first performance as the Amadeus Quartet in the Wigmore Hall, London on Jan. 10, 1948. They were soon performing in concerts, festivals and masterclasses all over the world. The quartet made about 200 recordings, among them the complete quartets of Ludwig van Beethoven, Johannes Brahms, and W. A. Mozart. They also performed works by such 20th-century composers as Béla Bartók and Benjamin Britten (who wrote his third quartet especially for them).

The Amadeus was one of the most celebrated quartets of the 20th century.

They had always agreed that if one of them became ill or died, the quartet would not play with any other person. The quartet stopped playing in 1987 after the death of the violist Peter Schidlof.

Norbert Brainin died in 2005 and Siegmund Nissel in 2008.

Partisan Review

Partisan Review was an American political and literary quarterly published from 1934 to 2003, though it suspended publication between October 1936 and December 1937. It was founded by William Phillips and Philip Rahv. It grew out of the John Reed Club as an alternative to "New Masses", the publication of the American Communist Party, but became anti-Communist after Stalin. Many of its early authors were the children of Jewish immigrants from Europe. The journal reached its peak influence from the late 1930s to the early 1960s, but then gradually lost its relevance to modern American culture. Phillips died in September 2002 at age 94. The journal continued under his wife Edith Kurzweil until April 2003.

In 1949, "Partisan Review" awarded George Orwell £357 for the year's most significant contribution to literature, "Nineteen Eighty-Four".

Semyon Grigorevich Frug (Szymon Frug)
Semyon Grigorevich Frug was born in 1860 into a family of Jewish farmes who lived in one of the Jewish farming colonies in southern 
Ukraine.From 1912 unitl his death in 1916 ,Frug lived in Odessa,where the sixth edition of his three-volume "Complete Works"was published in 1913.His talent as a writer,narrator and reader reached their full expression Odessa ,which was a center of Jewish literary 
activity.His contemporaries recalled the artistry with which he would read his work ,or rather declaim them by hearth,at literary evenings.Frug's works were mainly written in Russian with only a few stories written in Yiddish ,itself a reflection of the environment in which members of the Jewish intelligentsia moved at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries .In both his poems and prose he described with bitter humor and ruthless realism the life of the Jewish colonists ,their relationships with their Ukrainian and Russian neighbors ,the disagreements and occasional full-blown heated arguments about the relative merits or lack thereof of various Yiddish dialects spoken by Jewish from Lithuania and Belorussia in contrast to those who had settled in the villages of Ukraine a long time before.Frug himself said in one of his poems,encapsulating his work maybe better than others ,that the essence of his poetry is that"What I took from people with tears and grief,I give back with poetry ".One of the unique features of Frug's poetry is the number of them that were set to music and performed on stage.

Somatosensory system

The 'somatosensory system' is a sensory system that detects experiences labelled as touch or pressure, temperature (warm or cold), pain (including itch and tickle) and those that belong to proprioception. These are the sensations of muscle movement and joint position including posture, movement, visceral (internal) senses and facial expression. Visceral senses have to do with sensory information from within the body, such as stomach aches.

Touch may be considered one of five human senses; however, when a person touches something or somebody this gives rise to various feelings: the perception of pressure (shape, softness, texture, vibration, etc.), relative temperature and sometimes pain. Thus the term "touch" is actually the combined term for several senses. In medicine, the colloquial term "touch" is usually replaced with somatic senses, to better reflect the variety of mechanisms involved.

Flash (tattoo)

A flash (also known as a "tattoo flash") is a design or picture that is used in order to create a tattoo. They often come in sets like a poster (called flash sheets), and can be seen in most tattoo shops.

Tattoo flashes are often drawn for general use, rather than being a custom made piece like some personal tattoos. However, some flashes have space for personalisation, for example space for the person to include a name in their tattoo.

Tattoo flashes come in a variety of different designs, and are divided into categories such as celtic, heart, arm band tattoos e.t.c. A person wanting a tattoo made from a flash chooses which design they like best. Then the tattooist uses a stencil to draw the basic design onto the skin of the person being tattooed, and afterwards starts to make the tattoo.

Itch

Itch (Latin: pruritus) is an unpleasant sensation that leads to the desire or to . Itch has many similarities to pain and both are unpleasant sensory experiences but their behavioral response patterns are different. Pain creates a reflex withdrawal while itch leads to a scratch reflex. Nerve fibers for itch and pain both are in the skin, but information for them is sent centrally in two distinct systems that both use the same nerve bundle. 

Historically, the sensations of itch and pain have not been considered to be independent of each other until recently where it was found that itch has several features in common with pain but has important differences. 

The feeling of itchiness can be caused by a movement of hair or the release of a chemical (histamine) from cells under the skin. Itchiness is regarded as protective, as it helps creatures remove parasites that land on their skin.

Itching can be caused by:

A variety of over-the-counter and prescription anti-itch drugs are available. Some plant products have been found to be effective anti-pruritics, others not. Non-chemical remedies include cooling, warming, soft stimulation.

Sometimes scratching relieves isolated itches, hence the existence of devices such as the back scratcher. Often, however, scratching can intensify itching and even cause further damage to the skin, dubbed the "itch-scratch-itch cycle".

Ecliptic

The ecliptic is the apparent path that the Sun traces out in the sky during the year. As it appears to move in the sky in relation to the stars, the apparent path aligns with the planets throughout the course of the year. More accurately, it is the intersection of a spherical surface, the celestial sphere, with the ecliptic plane, which is the geometric plane containing the mean orbit of the Earth around the Sun. The ecliptic plane should be distinguished from the invariable ecliptic plane, which is perpendicular to the vector sum of the angular momenta of all planetary orbital planes, to which Jupiter is the main contributor. The present ecliptic plane is inclined to the invariable ecliptic plane by about 1.5°.

The name ecliptic is derived from being the place where eclipses occur.

No Mercy (2007)

No Mercy 2007 was a professional wrestling event available on pay-per-view made by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was the ninth yearly No Mercy event and took place on October 7 2007 at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Illinois.

For the first time, there were three new WWE Championship reigns in one night, as Randy Orton was awarded the vacant title (previously held by John Cena) to start the event, only to lose it to Triple H less than a half-hour later, but in turn regain it at the end of the night in a Last Man Standing match.

The other championship matches on the undercard were Batista versus The Great Khali in a Punjabi Prison match for the World Heavyweight Championship, Candice Michelle versus Beth Phoenix for the WWE Women's Championship, and CM Punk versus Big Daddy V for the ECW Championship.

The main feud going into the event for the RAW brand was between WWE Champion John Cena and Randy Orton. The feud began in July after Orton was named the number one contender for Cena's WWE Championship. At SummerSlam, Cena won against Orton, while at Unforgiven, Orton beat Cena by disqualification. Immediately after the match, acting "RAW" General Manager Jonathan Coachman, believing that Cena got himself disqualified intentionally, made a rematch between the two at No Mercy, this time in a Last Man Standing Match. On September 17, after threatening to strip Cena of his title for his actions at Unforgiven, Coachman ordered Cena's father, Mr. Cena, to face Orton in a match. The match saw Orton hit Mr. Cena with an RKO, while John was forced to watch at ringside while handcuffed to a ring rope. The next week, Coachman said that Orton had been suspended indefinitely for his actions, although he later said that Orton had simply been given the night off. The feud resumed on October 1 when Orton, who earlier appeared "via satellite from Chicago", attacked Cena after his match with Mr. Kennedy, knocking him out with an RKO on the announce table. However, during the match, Cena was legitimately injured, suffering a complete tear of his right pectoral tendon. As a result, the match was canceled, and on the October 2 version of "ECW", WWE Chairman Vince McMahon officially stripped Cena of the WWE Championship. No replacement match was ever announced, as McMahon simply stated that "a new WWE Champion will be crowned this Sunday."

The main feud for the SmackDown! brand was between Batista, and World Heavyweight Champion The Great Khali. The feud began in July when Khali laid out an open challenge to the "SmackDown!" roster, which was answered by Batista. Shortly after, the feud began revolving around the World Championship when Khali won a twenty-man battle royal on "SmackDown!", winning the vacant title. At The Great American Bash, Khali won against Batista and Kane in a triple threat match, while at SummerSlam, Batista beat Khali by disqualification after Khali used a chair. At Unforgiven, Batista won against Khali and Rey Mysterio in a triple threat match to win the championship. Khali exercised his rematch clause for a match at No Mercy, to take place in his specialty match, the Punjabi Prison match.

The main feud for the ECW brand was between the ECW Champion, CM Punk, and Big Daddy V. The buildup began when General Manager Armando Estrada announced an "Elimination Chase to No Mercy", involving Elijah Burke, Tommy Dreamer, Kevin Thorn, and Stevie Richards. All four competitors competed in a match together, with the one losing the fall being eliminated from the chase. The rest of the wrestlers then competed again, and the process continued until one superstar was left, with the winner challenging Punk for the title at No Mercy. Over a three-week period, Richards, Thorn, and Burke were eliminated, with Dreamer winning the number one contendership, until Estrada announced that there was one more contender in the chase, Big Daddy V. V quickly won against Dreamer, winning the number one contendership.

Before the event went live on pay-per-view, a dark match between Hardcore Holly and Cody Rhodes took place, which Holly won after executing an Alabama Slam.
The event began with WWE Chairman Vince McMahon and Raw General Manager William Regal coming to the ring. McMahon reiterated that former WWE Champion John Cena would be out of action between six months and one year. He then said that the new WWE Champion was Randy Orton. After a brief celebration, Regal gave Orton the choice of facing anyone he wanted that night for the championship. Before he could name an opponent, however, Triple H came out, demanding a championship match for that moment. After suggesting that he “didn't have the guts", McMahon ordered the match to begin. Triple H won the match after a rollup, becoming an eleven-time World Champion. Orton's championship reign lasted less than thirty minutes.

The next contest was a bonus six-man tag team match, which saw Jeff Hardy, Paul London and Brian Kendrick take on Mr. Kennedy and the World Tag Team Champions Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch, which the latter won when Kennedy hit the Green Bay Plunge on London.

Backstage, McMahon informed Triple H that his previously scheduled match against Umaga was still going to take place, and that his newly-won WWE Championship would be on the line.

Next up was lone ECW match of the evening as Chicago-native CM Punk defended his ECW Championship against Big Daddy V. The meeting was short lived as V's manager, Matt Striker, attacked Punk a couple of minutes into the match, causing a disqualification. Afterward, V attacked Punk, hitting him with several elbow drops, causing Punk to bleed from the mouth.

In a continuation of their personal rivalry, WWE Tag Team Champions Matt Hardy and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) came out to have a pizza-eating contest. The contest was moderated by ECW color commentator Tazz and also featured Maria and Melina as scorekeepers. Hardy won the contest two slices to none.

Up next was the second WWE Championship match of the evening as Triple H defended his newly-won title against Umaga. Triple H won the match and kept the championship after hitting Umaga with a pedigree.

"Friday Night SmackDown!" was represented in the next match as Rey Mysterio took on Finlay. The referee ended the match after Finlay snapped his head off the floor. However, while being taken away on a stretcher, Finlay jumped out and attacked Mysterio.

Backstage, Triple H was having his ribs iced down when McMahon came in to inform him that Orton was invoking his automatic rematch clause for the WWE Championship, and that the match would be taking place later that night. In addition, the match would be Last Man Standing, Orton's originally scheduled match against Cena.

The fourth championship match of the night was a rematch from Unforgiven, with Women's Champion Candice Michelle defending the title against Beth Phoenix. Phoenix pinned Michelle after a cradled suplex, winning the Women's Championship for the first time.

"SmackDown!'s" main event saw Batista defend the World Heavyweight Championship against The Great Khali in a Punjabi Prison match. While locked in the inner cage, neither competitor was able to escape through one of the four trap doors. Khali was able to escape the inner cage first. However, while climbing the outer cage, Batista, who had by this time reached the top of the inner cage, jumped to the outer cage to pull even with Khali. In a head-to-head race, Batista was able to reach the floor first, winning the match, and keeping his championship.
The main event of the evening saw a rematch from the start of the show, with Triple H defending the WWE Championship against former champion Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. The only way to win the match was to beat up the opponent so much that they could not answer the referee's ten-count. This was Triple H's third match of the evening, and Orton's second. In the end, Orton hit the RKO on Triple H over an announce table, and Triple H could not answer the ten-count. Orton won the WWE Championship for the second time of the night, and Triple H's eleventh world title reign lasted a little over two hours.

The following night on "RAW", Shawn Michaels returned after a five-month layoff to resume his feud with Randy Orton, who originally injured him back at Judgment Day. This feud also saw the inclusion of Mr. Kennedy and Jeff Hardy, who, along with Michaels, were named to a fan ballot to find out who was Orton's opponent for the WWE Championship at Cyber Sunday. Michaels won the ballot, but failed to win the championship.

Batista resumed his feud with The Undertaker after Taker interfered in a number one contenders match between Finlay and Rey Mysterio. He was subsequently named the top contender, which brought about a Batista vs. Taker match for Cyber Sunday, with Steve Austin winning a fan poll to become the special guest referee.

Candice Michelle used her rematch clause for the WWE Women's Championship on the October 22 version of "Raw" in a Two out of three falls match. Beth Phoenix got the upperhand and the first pinfall. Candice eventually got control in the match, but lost it after a botched move from the top rope, causing her to fall on her neck, shoulder and face. As a result, Candice suffered a cracked clavicle and Phoenix retained the title.

Reverse osmosis

Reverse osmosis is a separation process that uses pressure to force a solution through a membrane that keeps the solute on one side and lets the pure solvent to go to the other side.

This process is best known for its use in desalination (removing the salt from sea water to get fresh water), but it has also been used to purify fresh water for medical, industrial and domestic applications since the early 1970s.

Transport Layer Security

Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols that provide security and data integrity for communications over TCP/IP networks such as the Internet. Several versions of the protocols are common in applications such as web browsing, electronic mail, Internet faxing, instant messaging and voice-over-IP (VoIP).

The TLS protocol allows applications to communicate across a network in a way designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery. TLS provides endpoint authentication and communications confidentiality over the Internet using cryptography. Most of the time, only the server is authenticated ("i.e.", its identity is ensured) while the client remains unauthenticated; this means that the end user (whether an individual or an application, such as a Web browser) can be sure with whom it is communicating. The next level of security is known as mutual authentication. Mutual authentication requires public key infrastructure (PKI) deployment to clients unless TLS-PSK or the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol are used, which provide strong mutual authentication without needing to deploy a PKI.
SSL and TLS have been widely used in several open source software projects. Programmers may use the OpenSSL, NSS, or GnuTLS libraries for SSL/TLS functionality. Microsoft Windows includes a usage of SSL and TLS as part of its Secure Channel package. Delphi programmers may use a library called Indy.

The current approved version is 1.2, which is specified in:

Democratic-Republican Party

The Democratic-Republican Party was founded by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison in 1792. It became the most popular political party until the 1820s, when it split into competing , one of which became the modern-day Democratic Party. Its members spoke of the party as the Republicans, Jeffersonians, Democrats, or combinations of these (Jeffersonian republicans, etc.). 

Jefferson and Madison created the party in order to oppose the economic and foreign policies of the Federalists, a party created a year or so earlier by Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. Foreign policy issues were central; the party opposed the Jay Treaty of 1794 with Britain (then at war with France) and supported good relations with France before 1801. The party was against many of Hamilton's proposals concerning the Constitution.

Note that this party is different from the modern-day Republican Party.

Strict construction

Strict construction means a restriction of judicial interpretation. In the United States the phrase is also commonly used more loosely as a term for conservativism among the judiciary.

In its strict sense, strict construction requires a judge to apply the text as it is written and no farther, if the meaning of the text is clear. That is, judges should avoid drawing from a statute or constitution. 

For example, Justice Hugo Black argued that the First Amendment's that "Congress shall make no law," should be construed strictly: the term "no law," Black thought, admitted virtually no exceptions.

Assisi

Assisi is a town in Italy, in the region of Umbria. Assisi on the western side of Mt. Subasio. It is the birthplace of St. Francis. St Francis is most famous for founding (beginning) a religious order of Friars (Brothers) called the Franciscan, in 1208. One of St Francis' followers, St. Clare was also born in Assisi and founded an order of religious women called the Poor Clares. 

After St Francis, and St Clare died, churches were built in their honour. The Church of St Francis, called the Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi, is famous as his burial place, and is also famous for the fresco paintings on the walls and vaults (ceilings). Many visitors go to Assisi on pilgrimage. Many people also go there to see the artworks. Assisi is a World Heritage Site. 

Around 1000 BC, large groups of people settled in this area. These were the Umbrians. They lived in small fortified villages on high ground. From 450 BC the Umbrians villages were taken over by the Etruscans. Then the Romans took control of central Italy by the "Battle of Sentinum" in 295 BC. They levelled out some land in terraces (wide steps) and built a large town called "Asisium" on the side of Mount Subasio. This town became "Assisi". Some buildings still can be seen from Roman times in Assisi. They include the walls, the main piazza, and the Temple of the Goddess Minerva, which is now a church called "Santa Maria sopra Minerva".

In 238 AD all the people of Assisi became Christian, because of the teaching of Bishop Rufino. He was martyred. It is believe that his body is buried under the Cathedral Church of San Rufino in Assisi.

The Ostrogoths of king Totila destroyed most of the town in 545. Then Assisi was the ruled by the Lombards, who came from the north of Italy, and then by the Frankish rulers. 

In the 11th century (1000s), Assisi became a free town. But there was constant fighting between two groups called the Ghibellines and the Guelphs. Assisi mainly supported the Ghibellines, but the nearest big town, Perugia, supported the Guelphs. During the battle of Ponte San Giovanni (St. John's Bridge), the Guelphs from Perugia managed to capture a young man from Assisi. His name was Francesco di Bernardone. It was partly because of his experiences when he was captured that young Francesco decided that he would change from being a soldier. When he returned to his father's house, he put away all his riches and became a poor, wandering preacher, telling people to turn to God and live in peace with each other. He worked with the poor and the outcast people. They had no church except a ruin. St. Francis and his friends rebuilt the tiny ruined church for the shepherds and other poor people to worship in. It is called the "Porziuncola". Francesco (Francis) founded the Order of Franciscans. He was "canonized" (made a saint) in 1228 and is known as St. Francis. He is one of the most popular saints. 

A large basilica church was built on the side of the mountain, in honour of St Francis, and was beautifully decorated with scenes of his life. One of the most famous scenes shows the story of St. Francis preaching to the birds. In 1997 Assisi was hit by the two earthquakes. Part of the roof of the basilica fell in, killing four people who was standing below, and damaging the painted ceiling. Many people "made donations" (gave money) to repair the building which was reopened less than two years later.



The town has by two ancient castles. The oldest one was built by the Romans and is partly in ruins. 
The larger castle is called "Rocca Maggiore". It was built by Cardinal Albornoz in 1367 and was added to by Popes Pius II and Paul III. 
UNESCO has made all the main monuments, the churches and the town of Assisi as a World Heritage Site.

Festival Calendimaggio is held from May 1st-5th. There are processions, theatre, flag-weavers and dance.

Assisi Embroidery is a type of counted-thread embroidery which has been practised in Assisi since the 13th century.

Today the town has many groups coming to enjoy the simple peace of St. Francis. One such group has restored an 11th century room and added altars to the world's religions. Pilgrims come from many countries to the Assisi East West Retreat Center in Piazza San Rufino in the spirit of St. Francis to sit and be in peace.

Federalist Party

The Federalist Party (or Federal Party) was an American political party in the period 1792 to 1816. The Federalists controlled the federal government until 1801. The party was formed by Alexander Hamilton, who, during George Washington's first term, built a network of supporters, largely urban, to support his financial policies. These supporters grew into the Federalist Party, which wanted a sound and strong nationalistic government and was opposed by the Democratic-Republicans.

With the start of the new government under the Constitution, President George Washington appointed his former chief of staff, Alexander Hamilton, to the office of Secretary of the Treasury. Hamilton wanted a strong national government with financial credibility. 
By 1790 Hamilton started building a nationwide coalition. He his network of agents to link together friends of the government, especially merchants and bankers, in the new nation's dozen major cities. His attempts to manage politics in the national capital to get his plans through Congress, then, "brought strong responses across the country. In the process, what began as a capital faction soon assumed status as a national faction and then, finally, as the new Federalist party."

The Maroon Berets are an elite armed force that was created by officers from the Turkish Army. They are also called as "Bordo Bereliler". Their first mission is to eliminate terrorist attackers. Other missions are sneaking enemy territory, destroying enemy vehicles and reconnaissancing.

U.N and NATO Exercises every April:

World Key lock Record: 7 seconds, Turkish Maroon Beret commandos
Nearest opponent:13 Seconds, Delta Force

Point shot record: 200meters, Turkish Maroon Beret commandos
Nearest opponent: 140 meters , Spetznas

Turkish MB commandos came 1st in 22 of 24 exercises.

The Maroon Berets are the special forces organization of the Turkish Army.

The unit was created to counter any interior or foreign attacks on the Turkish Republic. MB officers receive extensive training and are expected to survive in all environmental conditions.

There are three categories of education and training that a MB will undergo. These are a) Domestic b) International c) Specialty

Within these three categories, there are 47 different subjects. Domestic training takes 72 weeks of basic training; International training takes 10 to 52 weeks of specialized training in different countries. It takes 3.5 years to become a MB.

The Trust Shot (in Turkish "Gūven Atışı") is a part of the MB's training program. It is exercised on the last month of the training and is to ensure that the soldiers can trust each other with their lives. The Trust Shot consists of two members of a squad standing next to paper target boards, while another member fires on the targets with a handgun while walking towards them from 15 metres (49.2 feet) away.

During the exercise the men standing next to the targets are not allowed to move or wear body armor.

The Maroon Berets (MB) came into the public spotlight when they captured the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan in Kenya. The identities of MB personal is classified.

Dimensionless quantity

In dimensional analysis, a dimensionless quantity (or more precisely, a quantity with the dimensions of 1) is a quantity without any physical units and thus a pure number. Such a number is typically defined as a product or ratio of quantities which do have units, in such a way that all the units cancel out.
""out of every 10 apples I gather, 1 is rotten."" -- the rotten-to-gathered ratio is (1 apple) / (10 apples) = 0.1 = 10%, which is a dimensionless quantity. 

There are infinitely many dimensionless quantities and they are often called numbers. Some of those that are used most often have been given names, as in the following list of examples (alphabetical order):

The standard infobox for album articles is the template. The box to the right is an example. The infobox code should be placed at the top of the article.

Most articles only need the following fields. For the full list of fields see advanced usage). If a value is unknown, do not remove fields but leave the value blank.

Please note that the field names are case-sensitive.

Try to fill in as many of the details as you can. If some details are unknown, leave the section blank or fill it with codice_1 to make it obvious to other editors that the info is needed. Wikilink wherever appropriate, but make sure you check your links and accordingly.

The album's title should be entered using text (not a logo), which will be automatically italicized.

The Type field refers to the general type of album. Enter a code from the following chart. The type will appear with the appropriate color and wikilink. If the type is unknown, leave the field blank.

An image of the official front cover of the original version of the album (or a reissue, if no original cover can be found) should be included at Cover. If you cannot find a cover image, just leave this field blank.


Only the "earliest" known date that the album was released should be entered. Use a "single" occurrence of , for example codice_1 (or codice_1 or codice_1 if the exact date isn't known). Later release dates can be mentioned in the article.

Details on where and when the album was recorded should be included.

The one or more music genres of the album should be entered. Separate each genre with a comma. Genres should be linked (piped linked (|) where needed), for example, "Rock, pop" should link to rock music and pop music. Most genres are not proper nouns. They do not need to be capitalized. The first word in the list should be capitalized.

The length of the album should be entered in minutes and seconds, even if the album is longer than one hour. For example an album that is 1 hour and 14 minutes long would be entered as 74:00. A source may be added as a comment, such as codice_1.

Only the record label that the album was originally released on should be entered. Sometimes very different versions have been released, such as alternate track listings in the U.S. and UK. The later release date and/or record label should be mentioned "in the article". Delete words like "Records" from the end of the label's name. For example, use codice_1, not codice_1).

The name of the producer should entered. The name would be wikilinked. If there is more than one producer, separate the names with commas.

Professional reviews may include only reviews written by professional music journalists, DJs, or found within any online or print publication having a (paid or volunteer) editorial and writing staff. Personal blogs are not acceptable. The standard for inclusion always is that the review meet Wikipedia's guideline for reliable sources and that the source be independent of the artist, record company, etc. A list of some sources of professional reviews is available at . Due to their proliferation and dubious value, lists (e.g. "Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Punk Rock Albums of the Early 1980s") may not be included.

The reviews should be listed alphabetically in the Reviews field. Start each one on a new line, beginning with an asterisk (*). The first part should be the name of the source (most commonly a magazine like "Rolling Stone"—note that magazines are italicized).

The second part should be the rating given in the review (e.g. 4/5). The rating should use the same format as in the review, to accurately portray the score of the review. For star ratings you should use the , for example, entering codice_8, will render: . For reviews by Robert Christgau you should use the , for example, entering codice_8, will render: . Numerical ratings, letter grades and other non-symbol ratings should be shown using plain text in parentheses, like (3.5/10), (B) or (90%). If no rating is given in the review you should use the word (favorable) or (unfavorable) to describe the review, possibly allowing for (ambivalent), (mixed), (extremely favorable) and more, but keep it short and simple. If you cannot summarize the review, just leave this second bit blank.

The third part is should a link to the actual review on an official page. It may also be a summary of the review located elsewhere (if the original publisher doesn't include it online). The link should display as the year that the review was published. If the year of publication cannot be found, the word "link" will be ok. If there are no online sources, you may include no link at all, but must then cite the information properly. The citation should include the full date of publication and preferably the page number.

Include no more than ten reviews. When choosing which reviews to include, consider the notability of the review source and keeping a . For older albums, try to include not just contemporary but also some more recent reviews.

The chronology section should link to the previous album on the left (using the Last album field) and the next album on the right (using the Next album field). The current album should be in the middle (using the This album field). Only studio albums, usually excluding live albums, compilations, singles and EPs should be included in the chronology.

The current album should always be in boldface. All album titles should be "italicized". The year of release of the albums should be listed in parentheses, separated from the album title by codice_8. Wikipedia's recommend that years should not be linked. Cover images should not be included in the chronology. For first albums the left box should be left blank. For latest albums the right box should be left blank. At least one of the two fields, previous or next, must have a value filled in, for the chronology to display.

No more than one album should be included in any of the three slots in the chronology. Additional chronologies may be used if necessary (see ). Albums released on the same day should be listed separately, ordered using the standard ordering of those albums, or alphabetically if no such standard exists.

In special situations, additional fields may be applicable. Unused fields may be either left blank, or deleted.

This field can be used to include information such as the title of the film that an album is the soundtrack to, or the name of the artist that a tribute album is in honor of. The text in this field appears between the type and the word "by".

This field should be used if the image being used is less than 200px. Fill in this field with the width of the image, using only a numeric value (i.e. "150", not "150px"). If set to "0", this hides the cover image, whether one is specified in "Cover" or the default cover image is used.

If the album has been issued with different front covers, which version the image refers to should be noted here.

This field should identify what language or languages are used in the lyrics of the album (assuming the music contains vocals). Do not forget to and pipe link (|) when necessary. For example, if an album's lyrics are in English and French, you would use codice_11.

This field is only applicable to video albums. The name of the director should be linked to the corresponding article. If there is more than one director, the names should be separated by commas.

This field is only applicable to compilation albums of any kind. Enter the person or group responsible for selecting the album's track listing.

This field can be used when the album belongs to an overall series when more explanation is needed. The text entered in this field replaces the artist name that would normally be displayed preceding "chronology". Examples include series of compilation albums compiled by different people, and series of soundtracks (which are often "various artists" collections).

A number of templates exist that can be inserted in the Misc field, including , , and . If any of these templates are used, do not forget to add the second set of closing brackets for the nested template.

Additional chronologies are generally useful for split albums, collaborative albums, and series of albums.

The Artist field should be the artist that this additional chronology reflects, for example one of the artists on a split album. The Type field should contain the same type as the rest of the infobox. The format of the other fields is the same as the standard chronology (see above).

If the album has been released with different album covers, they can be added to the infobox using this template.

The Upper caption field allows an optional header to be inserted and Lower caption allows for an optional explanatory label. For alternate covers the upper caption should be "Alternate cover" and the lower caption should mention where that cover was used (int'l release, re-release, censored original, etc.). As with the <nowiki></nowiki> template, the Type field should contain the same type as the rest of the infobox.

The template may be used as a miscellaneous addition to the infobox providing concise information about the album's single releases in sequence of their release (with the date provided also).

You may list up to twelve (12) singles per album. This infobox should be placed in the "Misc" field as shown below, using the field cases also shown below. Any unused fields may be left out. Further usage information can be found on the .


Note that all fields are already properly formatted, so italics or quotation marks need not be entered in fields.

Yellow Submarine

Yellow Submarine is a 1968 animated cartoon movie, based on the music of The Beatles, and was inspired by their song of the same name. It is also the title of two soundtrack albums, featuring the music used in the movie.

Beatles John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote "Yellow Submarine" in 1966, with help from another singer, Donovan, who also performed on the Beatles's recording of it. The recording appeared on their "Revolver" album, released later the same year. It also became a single, with "Eleanor Rigby" as its . Both songs became popular, but "Yellow Submarine" was especially liked by children.

King Features Syndicate, a cartoon publisher (who were also famous for Popeye the Sailor), produced an animated series featuring the Beatles's and songs. (The band themselves were not involved in the making or writing of the series, and did not like the series very much.) The Beatles had a contract with United Artists, to make three movies for them, but had not liked the way their second movie, "Help!", had turned out. They did not want to appear in another movie. When George Dunning and Al Brodax, who directed and produced their cartoon series, asked the Beatles for permission to make a cartoon based on "Yellow Submarine", they agreed mostly because the cartoon would help them finish their movie contract.

More Beatles songs (and ideas based on their song lyrics) would be featured in the movie. Along with using songs they had already recorded, the Beatles were expected to make new music especially for the cartoon. They did not put much effort into making this music. Instead they set aside songs, or songs that had not turned out as well as they had hoped, to give to the producers. In all, only four new songs were set aside for the movie. Two were written by George Harrison.

The band helped more with ideas for the movie's story, adding jokes and things they thought would make an audience laugh. Erich Segal, who later became famous for his novels "Love Story" and "Oliver's Story", helped write the screenplay for "Yellow Submarine". The Beatles' speaking voices in the movie were not their own, but were provided by actors.

The working on the movie did their best, to make it entertaining and interesting. George Martin, who was the Beatles's music producer, composed orchestral music to play behind the dialogue. He also worked hard, to make the music fit well with the of the cartoon.

The Beatles themselves produced a , "Magical Mystery Tour", which was shown on British TV over the Christmas holidays in 1967. It was strange, and did not have a normal . Many people who saw it did not like it, and ABC in the United States cancelled their plans to show "Magical Mystery Tour" in America. The failure of the show hurt the Beatles's reputation, even though the soundtrack still sold well. "Yellow Submarine" was scheduled to appear in cinemas during 1968, and many hopes were placed on it, to be a success.

When the Beatles saw an unfinished version of the cartoon, they were very pleased and impressed with it. They decided to appear in a , to finish the movie. "Yellow Submarine" made its public debut on June 6, 1968, and became an instant hit with audiences, especially with children and families. Most of the people who saw the movie did not know how little the Beatles had really been involved with making it, or even thought to ask. Many of their later memories of the Beatles were based on what they saw in "Yellow Submarine".

Even though one song, "Hey Bulldog", had been recorded specially for the movie, its sequence was edited out of the American version. The title still appeared in its credits, however.

Much of the movie is set in "Pepperland", an country filled with happiness, music, kindness and peace. The "Blue Meanies", who hate anything that is positive, invade Pepperland, taking it over and doing their best to destroy everything that the Pepperlanders love. Old Fred, a servant of Pepperland's , escapes the invasion in a yellow submarine, and seeks help.

He finds it in Liverpool, England, in the form of the Beatles, whom he brings back to Pepperland. They pass through the Sea of Time, the Sea of Holes, the Sea of Monsters, and the Sea of Green, finally reaching Pepperland. Disguised as Sergeant Pepper's Band (the official Pepperland band), they bring music back to the country, and are able to defeat the Blue Meanies. Rather than chase away or destroy the Blue Meanies, they instead invite them to the victory celebration. The Meanies change their ways, and learn to enjoy the things that make Pepperland a happy place.

The movie's soundtrack album did not appear until months after the movie was first shown. Another album, "The Beatles" (called the "White Album" by listeners, and later by the band themselves) came out first. The first half of "Yellow Submarine" featured the four new songs, the title song, and "All You Need Is Love", which played a major part in the storyline. The other half featured George Martin's orchestral . versions of the album also included "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", between the two halves.

Some critics and fans noticed that only a few Beatles songs appeared on the album, and were disappointed. Most did not care, and bought copies to hear the music. The album became another hit for the band.

"Yellow Submarine" was still popular years later, even after the Beatles disbanded in 1970. It appeared on television (including CBS) many times during the 1970s and 1980s, and also in small "second-run" theaters. During the 1970s, John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono had a son together, named Sean. Sean did not know his parents were famous. One day he saw the movie on television at his 's house, and came home full of questions about his father's Beatle past. Lennon told Sean that he gave up being a famous musician, so he could be a family man.

When came along, "Yellow Submarine" was released on , and copies sold well.

In 1998, "Yellow Submarine" was for a re-release, thirty years after it first appeared. Movie and recording technology had improved greatly over the years, and both the producers and Apple Corps, the Beatles's company, did not want the movie to seem old or outdated. They put much work into the remastering. The original version had been in sound. Most movie theaters now had , and the producers wanted to the sound if they could.

For many years the Beatles had not allowed any of their music. They made an exception for "Yellow Submarine", though. Technicians went back to the original recordings, using new machines and ideas to make them sound better than ever before. John Lennon had died in 1980, but the surviving former Beatles all approved the new mixes. Ringo Starr was impressed most of all, and was pleased that parts of the music could be heard, that had never been heard before.

Along with a re-release, the remastered "Yellow Submarine" was also issued on videotape and DVD. A new soundtrack (called "songtrack") album was also issued, that included the new mixes of all the songs used in the movie. (George Martin's orchestral music was not included, but was available on the original soundtrack, which was still for sale.)

Wikipedia:User talk page

A is a page where you send a message to a user. A user talk page is a kind of talk page that has the user's user name at the end of the "User talk:" part. For example, if your user name is "Blahblahblah", your user talk page is "User talk:Blahblahblah".

You do not have to sign up to Wikipedia and get a user name to have a talk page. For example, if you are editing Wikipedia from a computer with the Internet Protocol (IP) address 1.2.3.4, your talk page is "User talk:1.2.3.4". However, other editors who also edit Wikipedia from the same IP address will also have the same talk page. You may therefore find messages on the talk page that are not meant for you. If a certain IP address is used to (deliberately mess up or write nonsense on) Wikipedia articles, it may be blocked. You will then not be able to edit Wikipedia from that IP address until the block expires. That is why it is a good idea to get your own user name by signing up to Wikipedia. Another reason is that other editors are likely to trust you more if you have a user name.

You will know you have new messages on your user talk page if you see a message box at the top of your computer screen that looks like this:

Discrete cosine transform

A discrete cosine transform is a math process that can be used to make things like MP3s, and JPEGs smaller. It does this by breaking the sound or picture into different frequencies.

One way to calculate a discrete cosine transform is to use the Fourier transformation.
"Discrete" means that it works on discrete-time signals (sampled data).

For sounds, frequencies are the same as simple tones. You can make any sound by playing several tones at the same time. The discrete cosine transform is a way to find out which tones to play in order to make a given sound. The only difference between the tones is their pitch.

Human ears are good at hearing low pitches, but bad at hearing high pitches. If you use the DCT to break a sound into tones, you do not need to be as careful when playing the higher tones because people cannot hear them as well. MP3 encoders (programs which make MP3s) use this fact to make the sound smaller.

With pictures, frequencies are like stripes and checker patterns. Just like with sound, you can make any picture out of different frequencies. Also like sound, people's eyes are not as good at seeing high frequencies (hard edges and fine grain) as low frequencies (solid colors and smooth shades). JPEG encoders use this fact almost exactly the same way as MP3 encoders do.

French polish

French polishing is a way of giving a high standard of finish to wood.

The careful and skilled multiple-layering of shellac polish on properly prepared wood when completed results in a lusterous, perfectly flat shine of an exceedingly high standard. Indeed when applied correctly a french polished application can rarely be matched for sheer quality of finish.

Normally practiced by highly skilled craftsmen and women one might normally fine excellent examples of this superb finish in some of our stately homes although plenty of other examples exist. The advent of lacquered wood finishes has tended to make french polishing less needed in today's world.

People thought it was a system that was one of the principal characteristics of democracy. 

Aristotle saw equality and democracy in a close context:

"Democracy arose from the idea that those who are equal in any respect are equal absolutely. All are alike free, therefore they claim that all are free absolutely... The next is when the democrats, on the grounds that they are all equal, claim equal participation in everything."

Round Table

The Round Table was a table used by King Arthur and his knights, in the legends about him. The Round Table was in Camelot, the castle where King Arthur and his knights lived. In the legends, they met at the table to talk about the safety of Camelot and the kingdom, and about what adventures and quests they could go on. This got them the name 'The Knights of the Round Table'.

The shape of the table was very important. Most tables are rectangular, and have a place called the "head of the table". This is the narrow part at the top, where the leader usually sits. Because the table was round, it meant that the people who sat around it were all seen as equal.

The table is used by King Arthur and his knights. King Arthur's wife, Guinevere, did not have a seat at the table, but King Arthur did take her advice on occasion. In some versions of the legend, the wizard who lived in Camelot, called Merlin, also had a seat at the table. He was seen by King Arthur as a good friend and adviser. 

Some legends also note a special chair at the Round Table, called the "Siege Perilous", or 'Dangerous Chair'. Legend says that the seat could only be used by a knight who had a pure heart. A person with a pure heart was seen as someone who had committed no crimes or done any wrong. In the tale, anyone who sat in the chair but did not have a pure heart would die instantly. It was kept free by Merlin for the person who would one day find an object called the Holy Grail. This was a magical cup that was supposed to have been the one that Jesus drank out of during the Last Supper. In the story, this person was either Sir Gallahad or Sir Perceval, depending on what version of the story is told.

Valverde Province

Valverde is a province of the Dominican Republic. It is located in the northwestern part of the country. Its capital city is Mao.

It was created on 1959. It was a municipality of the Santiago province before being elevated to the category of province.

The Valverde province is in the northwest part of the Cibao Valley. It is bordered to the north and the west by the Puerto Plata province, to the east and south by the Santiago province, to the southwest by the Santiago Rodríguez province and to the west by Monte Cristi.

The province was named Valverde after José Desiderio Valverde, an officer of the Dominican army when the Dominican-Haitian War. Later, he was President of the Dominican Republic for one year (July 1857 - August 1858). He was from Santiago de los Caballeros.

Very few people lived in the lands of the Valverde province because it is very dry; there were only some people raising cattle in large ranches. The Spanish word for those ranches was "Hato" and there are many places in the province with the word "Hato" in their names (Hato del Yaque, Hato Nuevo, Hato Viejo, Hato del Medio) or "Hatico" (small "Hato").

The road from the border with Haiti to Santiago de los Caballeros, the second most important city of the country, went across this region and during the Dominican-Haitian War (1844-1856), Haitian armies came across this region and people did not want to live here.

Since the Dominican Independence, the territory was part of the Santiago province. It was made a province in 1959 with lands of the Santiago and the Monte Cristi provinces.

In 1918, a Belgian engineer, Luis L. Bogaert ("Monsieur Bogaert"), built a canal to take water from the river to the fields and he began to grow rice. That was an important change in the province and now Valverde is a province where rice is an important product.

The Valverde province has a total area of 823.38 km². It is a small province with only 1.7% of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 28th (out of 31 plus the National District) largest province.

There are three municipalities and ten municipal districts in the province.

The municipalities and their municipal districts (M.D.) are:

In 2002 (last national census), there were 158,293 people living in the Valverde province, and 114,153 (72.1%) living in towns and cities. The population density was 192.2 persons/km².

Most of the province is in a valley along the Yaque del Norte and Mao rivers.

The province is separated from the Puerto Plata province by the "Cordillera Septentrional" mountain range. The highest mountain of the province is in this range: "Loma Jicomé", also called "El Murazo"; it is 1,083 m high.

South of the city of Mao are the "Sierra Samba" (a chain of low hills) and part of the "Cordillera Central" mountain range. The highest mountains of the island are in the Cordillera Central but in the Valverde province there are only low mountains.

There are several important rivers that flow through the territory of the province. The most important river is the Yaque del Norte, that flows from east to west; the other rivers are all tributaries of Yaque del Norte. Other important rivers are Mao and Ámina that come from the Cordillera Central; those rivers that flow from the Cordillera Septentrional are very short and do not have much water.

The main economic activity of the province is farming and the main products are banana, plantain, rice and vegetables. Cattle is alto important in the province, mainly in the southern part of it.

Sugar cane was grown around the city Esperanza where there was a sugar factory. But the factory closed and sugar cane is not grown any more. Now there are some cloth factories in Esperanza.

Serket

Serket was an ancient Egyptian goddess. She was shown as a scorpion. She would sting "bad" people, but she could also cure scorpion stings and other poisons, such as snake bites. Because Serket could cure snake bites, she was sometimes known as the protector from Apep, the evil snake-god.

She was shown in art as a scorpion or as a woman with a scorpion on her head. Serket did not have any temples, but she had many priests.

Many people in ancient Egypt who were bitten by poisonous animals died from the poison. Because of this, Serket was also known as a protector of the dead. She was associated with fluids that cause stiffening during embalming. This caused her to become known as a protector of embalmers' tents and of the canopic jar for the intestine ("Qebehsenuf"). The intestine's canopic jar was the one associated with poisons. 

Because she was a protector of canopic jars, Serket was associated with Aset (Isis), and Nebet Het (Nephthys) and Neith. Later, Serket began to be known as Isis. Serket came to be known as a part of Isis, instead of a separate goddess.

Tempera

Tempera (sometimes known as "egg tempera") is a type of artist's paint. It was the main medium used for panel painting and illuminated manuscripts in the Byzantine world and the Middle Ages in Europe, until it was replaced by oil painting as the most popular medium for large paintings. It is still used for Orthodox icons. Some modern painters use tempera. 

In modern times, some manufacturers call ordinary poster paint by the name of "tempera". Poster paint is not really tempera. It is a different type of paint called gouache. 

Egg yolk (the yellow part of the egg) dries and sticks very firmly. It is used to mix and set the paints in a tempera painting. The colours are ground up into dry powders that must be mixed by the artist. In earlier times, some of the paints were very poisonous and the artist had to be careful not to breathe in the powdered paint. The paints are generally mixed with equal parts of egg yolk and water. If there is too much egg, the paint is gooey. If there is too much water, it is runny. Neither of these things are good. Some artists like to mix some of the egg white as well, for a different effect. Sometimes some oil is added. In ancient times other things were added which might include honey, milk and plant gums.

The painting must be done over a "ground" that has already been prepared. The "ground" is smooth flat paint on a strong board that does not bend. The paint must be put on in thin layers with tiny brush strokes that dry very quickly. Because the paint is transparent the artists use a special technique. They often paint the shadows on the figure before they paint the skin colour and colour of the clothing over the top. 

When the painting is finished, it is not very brightly coloured, until it has been varnished. This makes the colours bright and shiny. The good thing about tempera painting is that the colours do not change over the years, whereas oil paintings change, get darker and go more yellow. Tempera paintings can last well for at least two thousand years. Because tempera paintings take a long time to do, many of them are small. Sometimes artists painted large altarpieces in tempera. One of the biggest tempera paintings is Duccio's picture of the Madonna and Child in the Uffizi Gallery. It is about 15 feet high. Another very famous large tempera painting is Botticelli's "Birth of Venus" which is also in the Uffizi. 

Some of the oldest paintings in tempera are funeral portraits of dead people done is Egypt during the time of Ancient Rome. Tempera continued to be used for Christian religious paintings. It was the medium for Greek icons and was used in Italy and many other countries until oil painting came into use, in about 1500. Most of the famous Italian Renaissance painters used tempera. This includes Duccio, Giotto, Fra Angelico, Botticelli and Michelangelo. In Northern Europe they used oil paint. This started to become popular in Italy in the 1570s. Leonardo painted the "Mona Lisa" in oil paint. Nowadays, although oil paint and vinyl paint are much more common, some artists paint in tempera. One of the most famous tempera painters of the 20th century is Andrew Wyeth.

Tempera is a form of art painted using water-soluable and glutinous materials... 
Such as goats cheese, cows milk, egg yolk, goats milk and etc. It was mixed with pigments of colours like... bark and natural resources.

The Reign of Terror started on 5 September, 1793. The violence happened more and more often in June and July of 1794, a period called "la Grande Terreur" (The Great Terror), which ended 27 July 1794, when several important leaders of the Reign of Terror were executed, including Saint-Just and Robespierre.

French Constitution of 1791

The French Constitution of 1791 was the very first written Constitution of France. It was an important result of the French Revolution and adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen as its introduction.

This Constitution meant the creation of a French constitutional monarchy. The main controversy was the level of power to be granted to the King of France in such a system. 
After very long negotiations, the long expected first Constitution was brought in September of 1791. 

Although it helped make the Constitutional Monarchy, the King flew to Varennes due to the radicalism of Jacobins.

The principle of Separation of powers was the basis for the Constitution: The National Convention was the legislative body, the King and the Ministers made up the executive branch and the judicial branch was independent from the other two. However, the French Revolution still continued after this document was signed. 

The constitution attempted to establish a liberal bourgeois constitutional monarchy, but this did not work out. On 10 August 1792 the monarchy of France ended.

Knights of the Round Table

The Knights of the Round Table were characters in the legends about King Arthur. They were the best knights in King Arthur's kingdom, and lived in King Arthur's castle, Camelot. They were called the Knights of the "Round Table" because of a special table in Camelot, that was round instead of rectangular. This meant that everyone who sat around it was seen as equal.

"(see Round table.)"

In order to become a Knight of the Round Table, a knight had to prove he was chivalrous (polite) enough. In the legend, the knights swore a Code of Chivalry, which is much like an oath is today. This meant that they promised to uphold the rules given to them once they became a Knight of the Round Table.

Sir Thomas Malory (c. 1405 - March 14th, 1471) was an English writer, who wrote a book based on the legend of King Arthur. It was called Le Morte d'Arthur. In it, he wrote his version of the Code of Chivalry:


In different stories, there are different numbers of knights, ranging from 12 to more than 150. The Winchester Round Table says there were 25 Knights. However, the most commonly listed Knights of the Round Table are these:


This is a list of other knights mentioned as being Knights of the Round Table.

Executive (government)

In political science and constitutional law, the executive is the branch of government that is responsible for the day-to-day management of the state. 

In many countries, one simply speaks of the "government", but this usage can be confusing in an international context. The executive branch contains the head of government, who is the head of this branch. Under the doctrine of the separation of powers, the executive is not supposed to make laws (role of the legislature), nor to interpret them (role of the judiciary), their purpose is to enforce them: in practice, this separation is rarely absolute. The executive is identified by the head of Government. In a presidential system, this person (the President) may also 
be the head of State, where as in a parliamentary system he or she is usually the leader of the largest party in the legislature and is most commonly termed the Prime Minister (Taoiseach in the 
Republic of Ireland, (Federal) Chancellor in Germany and Austria). In France, executive power is shared between the President and the Prime Minister and this system has been reproduced in a number of former French colonies. Switzerland and Bosnia and Herzegovina have similar
collegiate systems for the role of head of state and Government. The Head of Government is assisted by a number of ministers, who usually have responsibilities for particular areas (e.g. health, education, foreign affairs), and by a large number of government employees or civil servants.

<doc id="100534" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100534" title="Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change">
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a group of scientists chosen by governments and other large groups from around the world who study the chance that humans may make the Earth heat up unnaturally. The group was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), two organizations of the United Nations.

The IPCC shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President of the United States Al Gore who won for working on the same problems.

A lot of IPCC work is publishing reports about the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), an international agreement that human inventions and chemistry may make the Earth too warm to live on. The UNFCCC was the beginning of the Kyoto Protocol. Members of the IPCC read, write, and calculate as much as they can. Only member states of the WMO and UNEP may be members of IPCC.
A lot of professors trust the IPCC work.

The first IPCC report was published in 1990. More was added to that report in 1992. The second report was published in 1995, the third was published in 2001, and a fourth in 2007. Each report is in three books called Working Groups 1, 2 and 3. Most times "the IPCC report" means the Working Group I report, which is about basic climate change.

The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) was completed in early 2007. Like earlier IPCC reports, it contains four reports, three of them from its working groups.

Working Group 1 was about the "Physical Science Basis of Climate Change." 
The Working Group 1 report was published on February 2 2007 and revised on February 2007. There was also a February 2 2007 press release. The full Working Group 1 report was published in March. The main report says::


The Summary for Policymakers for the Working Group 2 report was published on April 6, 2007.
The Summary for Policymakers for the Working Group 3 report was published on May 4, 2007.

The Third Assessment Report (TAR) contains four reports, three of them from its working groups:

The "headlines" from the Summary for Policymakers in "The Scientific Basis" were:


The estimate for the climate sensitivity was 1.5 to 4.5 °C; and the average temperature was predicted to increase by 1.4 to 5.8 Celsius degrees between 1990 and 2100, and the sea level was predicted to rise between 0.1 and 0.9 meters. The range of predictions is based on different levels of human carbon dioxide production. Each perdiction has different possible outcomes.

IPCC used the best predictions and their reports were watched by important scientists.
The IPCC believed they needed better predictions and better understanding of climate.
Some scientists claim the IPCC do not know enough about greenhouse gases to make good predictions.

MIT professor Richard Lindzen, who works for the IPCC Working Group 1, claims some of the IPCC reports are wrong. He told the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation that he was unhappy about the Executive Summary based on his work in May 2001. He said that he told the IPCC they were making mistakes and the Working Group 1 report said that meant they were "making improvements".

Professor Lindzen said:

The summary does not reflect the full document... For example, I worked on Chapter 7, Physical Processes. This chapter dealt with the nature of the basic processes which determine the response of climate, and found numerous problems with model treatments – including those of clouds and water vapor. The chapter was summarized with the following sentence: 'Understanding of climate processes and their incorporation in climate models have improved, including water vapor, sea-ice dynamics, and ocean heat transport.'

The Working Group 1 report said:



"Climate Change 1995", the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR), was finished in 1996. It was made in four parts:

Each of the working groups was made by its own working group, and each has a Summary for Policymakers (SPM) that is a list of agreements by governments. The Summary for Policy Makers of the Working Group 1 report says:


Three scientists involved in climate research believe that the IPCC reports do not accurately summarize the state of knowledge.

On December 20, 1995, Reuters news agency claimed a British scientist Keith Shine, one of IPCC's most important authors, talking about the Policymakers' Summary, said: "We produce a draft, and then the policymakers go through it line by line and change the way it is presented... It's peculiar that they have the final say in what goes into a scientists' report". Keith Shine did not say what differences the changes make.

Physicist Frederick Seitz, the President Emeritus of Rockefeller University, said the IPCC report was not good, writing "I have never witnessed a more disturbing corruption of the peer-review process than the events that led to this IPCC report". He opposed it in the Leipzig Declaration of S. Fred Singer's Science and Environmental Policy Project.

Professor Seitzs comments were opposed by the presidents of the American Meteorological Society and University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, who wrote about an effort by some people make it seem that humans had not changed the climate. .

S. Fred Singer said that :

Benjamin D. Santer, Lead Author of Chapter 8 of 1995 IPCC Working Group 1 report, said :

The Second Assessment Report was the only one with a chapter on the economic effect of climate change. This part of the report was thought to be unfair because the value of life in poorer countries was less.

The 1992 supplementary report was an update of the 1990 report, requested for the Framework Convention on Climate Change at the Earth Summit (United Nations Conference on Environment and Development) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.

It did not make any important changes to the 1990 report. It claimed the prediction methods in the First Assessment Report, were now improved, but did not include aerosol or ozone changes.

The IPCC first assessment report was completed in 1990, and used to make the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

The Working Group 1 report says:






The Chairperson of the IPCC is Rajendra K. Pachauri, elected in May 2002; before that Robert Watson headed the IPCC. The chairperson is helped by an elected Bureau including vice-chairpersons, Working Group co-chairpersons and a Secretariat (see below). 

The IPCC Panel is made of people from governments and other groups. Scientific experts are preferred. Meetings of the IPCC and IPCC Working Groups are held by members of governments. Non-Governmental and Intergovernmenta Organizations may be allowed to attend as observers. Meetings of the IPCC Bureau, workshops, experts and lead authors are by invitation only. 350 government officials and climate change experts visited the 2003 meeting. The meeting report says there were 322 persons in attendance at meetings with about seven-eighths of visitors being from governments.

There are several major groups:

The IPCC receives funding from UNEP, WMO, and its own Trust Fund which gets money from governments.

People from over 130 countries contributed to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report over 6 years. These people included more than 2500 scientific expert reviewers, more than 800 contributing authors, and more than 450 lead authors.

The Working Group 1 report of 2007 (including the summary for policy makers) included contributions by 600 authors from 40 countries, over 620 expert reviewers, a large number of government reviewers, and representatives from 113 governments .

The IPCC activities are controlled by the WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council to support the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

In April 2006, the IPCC released the "IPCC Fourth Assessment Report" or AR4. Reports of the workshops held so far are available at the IPCC website.

The AR4 Synthesis Report (SYR) was finalized in November 2007. Documentation on the meetings for the AR4 are available , the outlines for the Working Group 1 report and a provisional author list .

The IPCC also supports other activities, such as the Data Distribution Centre and the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme . This involves estimating greenhouse gas based on the levels of fuel used, industrial production and so on.

The IPCC also answers questions from the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA).

The IPCC reports are a collection of peer reviewed and published science. Each IPCC report explains improvements to the previous report and also explains where more research is needed.

There are usually three stages in the review :
Review comments are open to the public for at least five years.

There are several ways to agree what goes into the reports:

The Panel controls what the IPCC agrees on to meet standards. The Panel's "approval" process has been criticized for changing what the experts put in the Reports.

Each chapter has a lot of authors who are responsible for writing and editing the material. A chapter usually has two "Coordinating" Lead Authors who control what words go in their chapter, ten to fifteen Lead Authors, and a larger number of Contributing Authors. The Lead Authors put together the work of the other authors and report to the Working Group chairs. Lead Authors write sections of chapters. Contributing Authors prepare text, graphs and data.

Authors are chosen from a list of researchers prepared by governments, other important groups, the Working Group/Task Force Bureaux, and other experts (, 4.2.1,2). The group of Coordinating Lead Authors and Lead Authors for a section or chapter of a Report is expected to have many different views and to have people from different parts of the world.

In December 2007, the IPCC was awarded the The Nobel Peace Prize 2007 "for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change." The award is shared with Former U.S. Vice-President Al Gore for his work on climate change and the documentary "An Inconvenient Truth".

In January 2005 Christopher Landsea resigned from work on the IPCC AR4, saying that it was "both being motivated by pre-conceived agendas and being scientifically unsound" because of Kevin Trenberth's idea that global warming was contributing to recent hurricane activity . Roger A. Pielke who published Landsea's letter writes: "How anyone can deny that political factors were everpresent in the negotiations isn't paying attention", but says that "Despite the pressures, on tropical cyclones they figured out a way to maintain consistency with the actual balance of opinion(s) in the community of relevant experts." He continues "So there might be a human contribution (and presumably this is just to the observed upwards trends observed in some basins, and not to downward trends observed in others, but this is unclear) but the human contribution itself has not been quantitatively assessed, yet the experts, using their judgment, expect it to be there. In plain English this is what is called a 'hypothesis' and not a 'conclusion.' And it is a fair representation of the issue."

The IPCC Third Assessment Report showed a graph labeled "Millennial Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction" from a paper by Mann, Bradley and Hughes (MBH98) often called the "Hockey Stick Graph". This graph was different to the IPCC First assessment report which showed global temperature for the past 1000 years, and higher temperatures during the Medieval Warm Period. The graph was thought to show that temperatures between 1000 and 1900 were very different. This was criticized in an article by Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick. In a 2006 letter to "Nature", Bradley, Hughes and Mann claimed the original article had said that they could not be exact.

Some critics say the IPCC reports underestimate dangers, understate risks, and report only the lowest risks.

On February 1, 2007, the night before publication of IPCCs report on climate, a study was published saying that temperatures and sea levels have been rising at or above the speed the IPCC reported in 2001. The study compared IPCC 2001 predictions of temperature and sea level change with what actually happened. Over the six years, the actual temperature rise was near the top end of the range given by IPCC's 2001 prediction and the actual rise was more than the top of the range the IPCC predicted.

An example of scientific research which has indicated that predictions by the IPCC have uderstated risks is a study on rises in sea levels.

Political influence on the IPCC has been shown by the release of a memo by ExxonMobil to the Bush administration, and its effects on the IPCCs leadership. The Bush administration, at the request of ExxonMobil, wanted rid of Robert Watson, a climate scientist and IPCC chairperson, and to have him replaced by Pachauri, who was seen at the time as more friendly to industry.

In 2005, the UK House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs produced a report on the economics of climate change. It commented on the IPCC process:

"We have some concerns about the objectivity of the IPCC process, with some of its emissions scenarios and summary documentation apparently influenced by political considerations. There are significant doubts about some aspects of the IPCCs emissions scenario exercise, in particular, the high emissions scenarios. The Government should press the IPCC to change their approach. There are some positive aspects to global warming and these appear to have been played down in the IPCC reports; the Government should press the IPCC to reflect in a more balanced way the costs and benefits of climate change. The Government should press the IPCC for better estimates of the monetary costs of global warming damage and for explicit monetary comparisons between the costs of measures to control warming and their benefits. Since warming will continue, regardless of action now, due to the lengthy time lags.

Zimmermann Telegram

The Zimmermann Telegram (also called the Zimmermann Note) was a telegram sent to Mexico from Germany on January 16, 1917. It was what made America enter World War I. It is named for the German man who sent it, Arthur Zimmermann. Zimmerman was the German Foreign Secretary (took care of things with other countries). Zimmermann sent it to the German ambassador in the United States, Johann von Bernstorff. Bernstorff then sent it to the German ambassador in Mexico, Heinrich von Eckardt.

The telegram told the Mexicans to join the war on the Germans' side in the Central Powers. The telegram told the minister to tell the Mexicans to attack America. Germany promised to give Mexico back all the land the United States had taken from Mexico if they helped the Germans win the war. America took Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona from Mexico. Germany wanted America to enter the war so America would stop helping the enemies of Germany. Germany wanted to get America to go to war with Mexico to distract America. 

The British secretly got the telegram. They were able to decode the telegram. They held on to the telegram until February 24, 1917. They gave it to President Woodrow Wilson of the United States of America. President Wilson published (showed the people of the United States) the telegram. The telegram made the American people angry. Wilson asked Congress (makes laws for the United States) for a Declaration of War (permission for war against another country). Congress accepted the request on April 2, 1917. The United States of America announced war on Germany on April 6, 1917. America did not want to join the war. The telegram is what made America come into the war.

Battle of Stalingrad

The Battle of Stalingrad is a battle fought during the Second World War between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. They were fighting for control of the city of Stalingrad. The battle was fought between 17 July 1942 and 2 February 1943. It was one of the most important battles of the Second World War.

Stalingrad, now Volgograd, was a city on the Volga River. It was an important industrial city. If the Germans had won the battle then they would also have been able to control the Caucasus area of Russia which had a lot of oil. Hitler also wanted to capture Stalingrad because it was named after Josef Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union.

In June 1942, Adolf Hitler launched Operation Blue, which was an offensive attack in southern Russia. By the end of July the German army had reached Stalingrad and the German air force, the Luftwaffe, started bombing the city. During the Summer and Autumn of 1942, the Germans dropped 1,000 tonnes of bombs on Stalingrad. A bombing raid on 23 August 1942 caused a huge fire. The bombing turned the city into ruins. However, the rubble gave the Russians hiding places from which they could attack the Germans, using snipers.

Hitler and Stalin sent in large numbers of soldiers. They ordered that there was to be no retreat.

1.6 million casualties were reported in battle in total, with more Russian deaths, but it was a good morale victory for the Russians, because they had defeated so many Germans.

Stalingrad was known as "Tsaritsyn" until 1925 and is "Volgograd" since 1961.

<doc id="100547" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100547" title="World War I reparations">
World War I reparations

World War I reparations means the payments and transfers of property and equipment that Germany was forced to make after its defeat during World War I.

Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles (the 'war guilt' clause) declared Germany and its allies responsible for all 'loss and damage' of the Allies during the war and set up the basis for reparations.

In January 1921, the total sum due was decided by an Inter-Allied Reparations Commission and was set at 269 billion gold marks, about £23.6 billion or $32 billion (roughly $393.6 billion US dollars as of 2005). This was a sum that many economists believed to be too much. Later that year, the amount was reduced to 132 billion marks, which still seemed too much for most German observers, both because of the amount itself as well as the terms.

Germany stopped to pay the reparations after Hitler's Nazi Party took power in 1933. About one-eighth of the reparations paid by then. The final payments were made on the day exactly 20 years after German reunification.

There was large debate about the justice and likely impact of the reparations decided. John Maynard Keynes resigned form the British Treasury in 1919 to protest this high sum of money demanded.

The 1924 Dawes Plan changed Germany's reparation payments. In May 1929, the Young Plan reduced further payments to 112 billion gold marks ($28.35 billion over a period of 59 years, which was 1988). In addition, the Young Plan divided the yearly payment, set at two billion gold marks (US$473 million), into two parts: one part equal to one third of the sum and could not be postponed and a postponable part for the remaining two-thirds. 

Because of the Great Depression there was an attempt to delay further payments. It failed, but 
in the Lausanne Conference of 1932, it was decided to cancel reparations. By this time Germany had paid one eighth of the sum required under the Treaty of Versailles. But Germany refused to continue paying upon Hitler's rise to power.

Only a few German people accepted that they lost the war. The German High Command blamed many civilian parts in the society, especially socialists, communists and Jews. The idea was known as "Dolchstoßlegende" (stab-in-the-back myth). The Germans were unhappy with the sum of reparations, which seems terrible, partly because German leaders could not represent in the decision.

The economic problems from the payments was said to be the important factor that led to the end of the Weimar Republic and the beginning of dictatorship of Adolf Hitler. John Maynard Keynes, a British economist, said that this would weaken German economy as well as German politics. However, many historians disagreed with him. Margaret MacMillan, a Canadian historian, showed her idea that Germany could have paid all the payments if they wanted to. She said that the problem was Germany would not like to pay.

Sally Marks, an American historian, also thought that Germany could pay the reparations. She said that the Germans paid the reparations in full and on time as long as the French occupied Düsseldorf in 1921, but stopped after the French were no longer stationed there in 1922. Later that year, the problem became more serious as French and Belgian representatives urging to occupy Ruhr Area and forced Germany to pay, while the British urging to lower the reparations. Occupation of the Ruhr began in January 1923. The Allies was quite sure that the German government intended to refuse paying to test if the Allies willed to enforce reparations.

As a "quiet fight" in the Ruhr, the German government began the hyperinflation that destroyed the German economy in 1923. In 2008, a British historain Richard J. Evans said that the German government was responsible for the hyperinflation as they preferred this to paying reparations. The Germans won the world's pity, and after that, the French were forced to agree to the Dawes Plan of April 1924, which lowered the reparations. Under this new plan, Germany paid 1 billion marks in 1924 and reached the total of 2.25 billion by 1927. After that year, Germany was able to pay 2.5 billion marks per year. However, the Germans still stop paying the reparations. To deal with this, the Allies met in a conference in London in July-August 1924, and was the first time that Germany challenged the Versailles Treaty.

The Germans complained further that payments under the Dawes Plan were too high, the Young Plan of 1928 was set up and the Germans were not required to pay higher than 2.5 billion until 1988. Gustav Stresemann demanded that Rhineland must returned to Germany in order that Germany accept the plan. Under strong pressure, the French left Rhineland in June 1930.

The British historain A. J. P. Taylor wrote that the reparations was harsh enough to be seen as a punishment, but not enough to stop Germany from regaining its great power status, and can be blamed for the rise of Adolf Hitler.

<doc id="100571" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100571" title="Richard III (play)">
Richard III (play)

Richard III is a history play written by William Shakespeare. It is one of Shakespeare's most famous and popular plays. Shakespeare probably wrote "Richard III" around the year 1593. The play was first printed in a book in 1597.

Like other history plays written by Shakespeare, "Richard III" is about people and events from earlier in English history. The real Richard III was king of England from 1483 to 1485. Shakespeare used the history books of his own time to create his play, though many modern experts do not think those early histories, or Shakespeare's play, are accurate and free of bias.

"Richard III" is different from many plays, because its leading character is a villain, not a hero. In his play, Shakespeare shows the king as a cruel tyrant who does many evil acts, before he is defeated in battle and killed by Henry Tudor. Tudor then becomes Henry VII of England, the next English king and the first of the Tudor dynasty.

Shakespeare lived and wrote before modern ideas of freedom of speech and freedom of the press had become accepted. The English government of Shakespeare's day practiced censorship of books and plays. Elizabeth I of England, who has queen from 1558 to 1603, was the granddaughter of Henry VII and the last Tudor ruler. Her government saw Richard III as a villain and the man who replaced him, Henry VII, as a hero, and censored any other point of view. If Shakespeare had wanted to write a play with Richard III as a hero, he would not have been allowed to do so.

A famous movie version of "Richard III" was made in 1955. Laurence Olivier directed the movie and played the leading role. Other movie and television versions, and many modern stage productions, have also been done.

<doc id="100581" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100581" title="Lojban">
Lojban

Lojban is a made up (invented) language that some people speak. It is an unusual language because there is no country where everyone speaks Lojban. People from all countries learn and speak Lojban only if they want to. A person who speaks lojban is called a lojbanist. It was first made up by a man called James Cooke Brown in 1955, but the Lojban that people speak now is from a book written by a man called John Cowan in 1997.

Lojban is a language that was made after looking at how people speak. It works with how people think too, to try to make a language that makes it easy to understand what people say.

Lojban came from the language "Loglan", another invented language.

The people who created Lojban wanted it to be simple and easy to learn, so it only has 1300 main words. To make more complex words, all you have to do is put main words together. If you speak Lojban correctly, there is no way for someone else to be confused by what you are saying. One of the problems with normal languages like English is that many words have different meanings. For instance, the English word "bat" can mean a baseball bat or a type of animal. In Lojban, each word only means one thing, so everyone understands.

Here are some examples of words and sentences in Lojban:
"mi'e" is used when you are telling somebody your name. There is no country where everyone speaks Lojban, so nobody is born with a name in Lojban. But, some Lojbanists make up lojban names for themselves that they use. Because they know most other people do not speak lojban, they usually keep their real name as well, and only use their lojban name when speaking to other lojbanists. If someone is telling you their real name, they usually say "mi'e la'oi" (sounds like "miheh lahoy") followed by the name.

"go'i" means "yes, I agree with you". Sometimes in English, the word 'yes' is used to mean other things. For example, you might say "Yes" (or "OK" or "uh-huh") to tell someone that you heard what they are saying. In Lojban you do not say "go'i" for this; instead you say "je'e" (sounds like "zhehheh"). This is part of the idea of lojban: to make words easier to understand by making sure that one word can only mean one thing.

Oil painting

Oil painting is a way of painting pictures with "pigments" (colours) that are held together by the medium of oil. The most usual type of oil that is used in paint is linseed oil. A picture that is painted using oil paint is called an "oil painting". Oil paint takes a long time to dry. Artists find this useful because they can keep working on the painting for a long time. People say that Leonardo da Vinci worked on his painting of the Mona Lisa for four years, even though it is not a very big picture. Oils paints, and oil paintings are often just called "oils" for short. If someone talks about "painting in oils" they mean that the painting is done in oil paints.

No-one knows when oil paint was first used. Caves in Afghanistan are decorated with ancient paintings in paint mixed with oils.
It is believed that this type of paint was used in other countries of Asia as well.. 

It is believed that oil paint was used in Europe in the Middle Ages at first for decorating shields, because oil paint lasted better than the traditional paint of tempera when it was in the weather, or if it was roughly treated. In 1125 a writer called Theophilus (whose real name might have been Roger of Helmarshausen) gives instructions for how to make oil paint in his book called "On Diverse Arts". 

The Renaissance art historian, Giorgio Vasari, said that the art of oil painting came from Northern Europe and the person who invented it was the famous Flemish painter Jan van Eyck. Artists from the areas of modern Belgium and the Netherlands were the first artists to make oil painting their usual method of painting. This trend spread to other parts of Northern Europe. A famous painting called the "Portinari Altarpiece" by Hugo van der Goes arrived in Florence in the 1470s at a time when Leonardo da Vinci was young. Oil paintings at this date were usually done on wooden panels, in the way that tempera pictures were. 

Another influence on oil painting in Italy was an artist from Sicily called Antonello da Messina, who had learnt to paint in oils. He travelled the length of Italy, from Sicily to Venice and did many small paintings including portraits and pictures of the Madonna and Child and Jesus. He influenced many artists, particularly in Venice. Giovanni Bellini, who was one of a family of well-known painters, was one of the first painters in Italy to paint very large pictures in oil paint. Artists from other parts of Italy visited Venice and soon the new method of painting spread. 

By 1540, there were very few painters who still worked in tempera, the previous method for painting on panels. In Italy, many artists continued to decorate walls and ceiling with fresco. However, it was discovered that oil paint, unlike tempera was flexible (it could bend). This meant that it could be used on flexible surfaces like cloth without breaking away and falling off. Once painting on canvas (heavy linen cloth) became usual, artists were able to do enormous pictures. If the painting was too big to fit through a doorway, the artist could just roll it up. 

Since the 1500s, oil painting has remained the favourite technique for artists who want to paint a picture that will last for a long time. The gallery below shows works by some of the most famous artists who have worked in oil paint. The famous artists of the 20th century are not shown here, because their works are copyright. Famous Modern artists who have painted in oils include Picasso, Matisse, Mondrian, Chagall, Kandinsky, Salvador Dali, Francis Bacon, Lucien Freud, Jackson Pollock and Brett Whiteley. 
Linseed oil, which is the main type of oil used for oil painting, comes from the flax seed. Flax has been an important crop for thousands of years, because linen cloth is made from it. This means that the oil for painting and the cloth for painting on both come from the same plant. To get different effects, artists would use mixtures of different oils. These include pine resin, frankincense, poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and in more modern times safflower oil. 

Artists use turpentine or mineral spirits to thin the paint if they wanted to make a fast-drying sketch that they can then paint over in more detail. The oil paint on the artist's brushes is cleaned out with turpentine after use. Modern chemists have made oil paints that can be used with water. This makes the clean-up job at the end of painting much easier and less smelly. Oil paint is usually dry to the touch in a day to two weeks, depending on how much oil and turpentine is in it. An oil painting is generally varnished when it is finished, which gives a slight shine to the surface and protects it. A painting should dry for several months before it is varnished. An oil painting is not completely dry until it is 60 to 80 years old. Varnishing used to be considered an important part of finishing a painting. Many modern artists do not varnish their pictures at all.

Linen canvas is the traditional surface for an oil painting. Cotton canvas can also be used, and is cheaper. The canvas must be stretched tightly over a frame called a "stretcher" and fixed into place with little tacks or staples. Then it must be treated with a sort of glue called "size". This is often made from boiled rabbit skins. Some artists like to paint on board rather than canvas.

Before an artist can paint on a board or canvas, they must prepare it with a "ground" or "undercoat" of plain white paint. Then the artist can sketch a picture onto the surface using charcoal, or paint that is made thin and quick-drying with turpentine or mineral spirits. The artist often works in a brownish or bluish colour, to suggest where the "tone" (light and dark) will be in the finished painting. Then the colours and details are put on in layers. 

The good thing about oil paint is that it can be used in all sorts of ways that most other types of paint cannot be used. 
Because oil paint can be used in so many different ways, it is better than any other type of paint for painting different textures. 

The first European artists to use oils liked to make the surface very smooth. By the middle of the 1500s, some artists like Tintoretto were painting in a much streakier way. Rembrandt, in the 1600s, used the oil paint in all sorts of ways to get different effects. He used every technique that is described in the list above. After Rembrandt, there were always some artists who liked to work in a smooth way, and others who used many different ways of putting on the paint. This has continued through to Modern times.

Proselytism

Proselytism is the practice of attempting to convert people to another opinion and, particularly, another religion. 

The word "proselytism" comes from the Greek language prefix 'pros' (towards) and the verb 'erchomai' (I come). Historically in the New Testament, the word proselyte meant a person who had converted to the Jewish religion. Though the word proselytism was originally used in Christianity, it is also used to refer to other religions' attempts to convert people to their beliefs or even any attempt to convert people to another point of view, religious or not. Today, the connotations of the word proselytism are often negative.

Armistice

An armistice is the effective end of a war, when the parties agree to stop fighting. The word comes from the Latin "arma", meaning weapons and "statium", meaning a stopping. 

A truce or ceasefire usually refers to a "temporary" stop of hostilities for an agreed limited time or within a limited area. A truce may be needed in order to negotiate an armistice. 
An armistice is not the same as a peace treaty, which may take months or even years to agree on. The 1953 Korean War armistice is a major example of an armistice which has not yet been followed by a peace treaty. 

The United Nations Security Council often demands cease-fire of parties in modern conflicts. Armistices are always negotiated between the parties themselves and are thus generally seen as more binding than UN cease-fire resolutions in modern international law. 

The most famous armistice is the Armistice with Germany at the end of World War I, on 11 November, 1918, signed near Compiègne, France, and effective at the "eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month."

The armistice treaty between the Allies, who fought Germany during World War I, and Germany was signed in a railway carriage in Compiègne Forest on November 11, 1918, and marked the end of the First World War on the Western Front. Marshal Ferdinand Foch, the Allied Commander-in-chief, and Matthias Erzberger, Germany's representative were the most important persons who signed it.

The Armistice was agreed at 5 AM on November 11, to come into effect at 11 AM Paris time. 

Acting German commander Paul von Hindenburg had requested arrangements for a meeting from Ferdinand Foch via telegram on November 7. He was under pressure of imminent revolution in Berlin, Munich and elsewhere across Germany.

WWE SmackDown

WWE SmackDown is a professional wrestling television program for WWE. Currently it is the only television broadcast for the SmackDown! brand. From its launch in 1999, "SmackDown!" was shown on Thursday nights, but as of September 9 2005, the show moved to Friday nights. To reflect this change, the show is now known to as "Friday Night SmackDown!". The SmackDown! brand is currently one of WWE's two brands, the other being Raw.

Its currently shown in the United States on MyNetworkTV, in Canada on The Score Network and on E! Montreal, in Turkey on "Fox Tv", in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan on Ten Sports, in Germany on DSF, in the UK and Republic of Ireland on Sky Sports 3, Italy on Sky Italia, in Finland on "Urheilukanava", in Portugal on TVI, in the Dominican Republic on "Antena Latina" Channel 7, in Puerto Rico on WAPA and on The CW, in Ecuador on Teleamazonas, in Chile on Chilevisión,in Malaysia on TV3, in Mexico on 52MX, in Australia on FOX8, in New Zealand on The BOX,in Bulgaria on GTV, in the Philippines on Jack TV and ABC, in Peru on ATV, in Spain on Cuatro, in Romania on TV Sport, in Serbia on FOX Televizija, in Saudi Arabia and Middle East on Showtime Arabia and ShowSports 4, in France on NT1, in Japan on "J Sports", on e.tv in South Africa, on AFN Xtra, on the Super Channel (Channel 10) in Fiji Islands, on VTV in El Salvador, on Canal 9 in Argentina, on Canal 4 RP in Panama and on SBT in Brazil.

"SmackDown!" was first seen on April 29, 1999 as a single television special on UPN. On August 26, 1999, "SmackDown!" officially started on UPN, in Kansas City, Missouri. Like "WCW Thunder", "SmackDown!" was recorded on Tuesdays and then broadcast on Thursdays. The new WWF show was so popular that WCW moved "Thunder" to Wednesdays in the hope of holding on to fans rather than losing them to WWF. "SmackDown!", like "Thunder", made heavy use of the color blue, earning it the nickname "The Blue Show" amongst wrestling fans.

The first "SmackDown!" set was different as it had an oval-shaped TitanTron (which was dubbed the "OvalTron"), entrance and stage which made it stand out from the "RAW" set and its rectangular TitanTrons. An added feature to the first set was the ability for the OvalTron to be moved to either the left or right of the stage. Throughout the show's early existence, top WWF superstar The Rock routinely called "SmackDown!" "his" show, in reference to the fact that the name was derived from one of his catchphrases, "Laying the smackdown." In August 2001, as part of celebrating "SmackDown!"'s second anniversary, the show got a new logo and set. The last "SmackDown!" to use the previous television set saw Alliance member Rhyno Gore WWF member Chris Jericho through the center screen, destroying part of the set.

In early to mid-2002, WWE had a process they called the "Brand Extension". WWE divided itself into two "de facto" wrestling promotions with separate rosters, storylines and authority figures. RAW and SmackDown! would host each division, give its name to the division and essentially compete against each other. The split was a result of WWF purchasing their two biggest competitors, WCW and ECW. The brand extension was publicly announced during a telecast of "WWF RAW" on March 25 2002, and became official the next day.

Wrestlers now would become show-exclusive, wrestling for their specific show only. At the time this excluded the WWE Undisputed Championship and WWE Women's Championship, as those WWE titles would be defended on both shows. In August 2002, WWE Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar refused to defend the title on RAW, in effect causing his title to become exclusive to SmackDown! The following week on "RAW", General Manager Eric Bischoff awarded a newly instated World Heavyweight Championship to RAW's designated #1 contender, Triple H. Due to the fact that since the WWE Undisputed Championship was now SmackDown! exclusive it was no longer seen as "Undisputed". Following this, the WWE Women's Championship soon became RAW-exclusive as well. As a result of the Brand Extension, an annual "draft lottery" was instituted to exchange members of each roster and generally refresh the lineups. 

On June 6 2005, WWE Champion John Cena switched brands from SmackDown! to RAW as part of the month-long Draft Lottery. This effectively left SmackDown! without a World Title. During this time, United States Champion Orlando Jordan was billed as the top champion on the show. On June 23 2005, in Tucson, SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long announced a six-man elimination match between John "Bradshaw" Layfield, Booker T, Chris Benoit, The Undertaker, Christian (replacing The Big Show, who was picked by RAW in the lottery), and Muhammad Hassan to crown the first SmackDown! Champion. On the June 30 episode of "SmackDown!", JBL won the match. Long appeared afterward and stated that even though JBL had won the match, SmackDown! did not need a Championship anymore. Batista, the World Heavyweight Champion, entered the ring as SmackDown!'s final draft lottery pick. Long also showm that JBL was the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship.

It was possible that WWE's "lame duck" status with Viacom on Spike TV is what prompted its moving "SmackDown!" to the Friday night death slot for the Fall 2005 season. However, it worked out for both parties involved, as the show did better in the ratings than it had on Thursdays, while UPN got much better ratings on Fridays than it did before, with its movie night. Also, UPN had been able to hold on to the ratings from Thursday nights, most notably with comedian Chris Rock's "Wonder Years"-like sitcom "Everybody Hates Chris". In January 2006, prior to the announcement of the CW Network, it was announced that UPN had renewed "SmackDown!" for two more years.

Following the cancellation of "", "SmackDown!" was renamed "Friday Night SmackDown!" and moved into "Enterprise"'s old timeslot in the United States. WWE promoted this move with the tagline "TV that's changing Friday nights." "Friday Night SmackDown!" made its start on September 9 2005. The program still aired on Thursdays in Canada on the Score. In the United Kingdom and Australia, their stations Sky Sports and FOX8 air "SmackDown!" on Fridays before the United States due to the time difference. This is the first time a major weekly WWE show airs internationally before it hits screens in the U.S.

The events of Hurricane Katrina affected the first version of "Friday Night SmackDown!" in the U.S. due to a special fundraising concert (see ) that was shown on UPN at the same time that the first version would have been shown, resulting in only the second hour of the show being shown on UPN. The first hour was instead streamed from WWE's website. Other countries, including Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and the Philippines received the full two-hour show. WWOR-TV (My 9, New York, New York) also aired both hours of the show on tape delay on Saturday, due to a previous commitment to broadcast the New York Yankees on Friday nights.

At the "SmackDown!" taping on January 10 2006, Batista had to forfeit the World Heavyweight Championship because of a triceps injury. Theodore Long made a Battle Royal for the vacant title. The winner was at the time RAW superstar Kurt Angle, who later switched to the SmackDown! brand. In a break from their traditional role of acting as if "SmackDown!" is not pre-recorded, WWE.com had a photograph of Angle holding his new title on the main page. WWE also did this when Edge cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to win the World Heavyweight Championship from The Undertaker and when The Great Khali won a battle royal after Edge's injury. 

On the April 7 2006 version of "SmackDown!", general manager Theodore Long said that the King of the Ring tournament would return after a four year hiatus as a "SmackDown!"-exclusive tournament. The tournament ended at Judgment Day 2006 with Booker T as the winner, defeating Bobby Lashley in the final.

On June 9 2006, Tazz left the SmackDown! brand to join the new ECW brand, leaving the color commentator position on SmackDown! vacant. However, on June 11 at One Night Stand 2006, JBL revealed that he would be the new color commentator for SmackDown! He stayed in that position until December 2007 when he left SmackDown! to become an in-ring competitor on RAW. Jonathan Coachman replaced him afterwards.

On September 22 2006, "Friday Night SmackDown!" was started on the The CW Television Network, a joint venture between CBS Corporation, owner of UPN, and Warner Bros. Entertainment, a subsidiary of Time Warner, majority owner of The WB.

For four weeks before the official start (and in preparation for the impending removal of UPN in several markets by the start of MyNetworkTV on September 5 2006) of "Friday Night SmackDown!" on the CW on September 22 2006, Tribune Broadcasting television stations in six major markets (including WPIX in New York City and KTLA in Los Angeles) aired WWE's "Friday Night SmackDown!" early in September 2006. Two other future affiliates of The CW, WCWJ in Jacksonville, Florida and WIWB in Green Bay, Wisconsin, also aired "SmackDown!" in early September as well.

The transition to the CW caused an interruption in the broadcast of "SmackDown!" in the state of Utah beginning in June when KPNZ in Salt Lake City stopped airing all UPN programs early. The show is now seen on KUCW. In Hawaii, "SmackDown!" returned in late 2006, airing on a CW digital subchannel of Honolulu's FOX affiliate KHON (Channel 2), which has received statewide carriage over Oceanic Time Warner Cable. Since the move to the CW Network, "Friday Night SmackDown!" has shown a major increase in ratings now averaging a 3.0 national rating. In addition, "SmackDown!" has become the second highest watched program on The CW.

On April 20 2007, "SmackDown!" celebrated its 400th episode. Ratings success soon followed. On June 8 2007, "Friday Night SmackDown!" made CW history by making a three-way tie with CBS and ABC in the key ad demographic, adults 18-49 by drawing a 1.5 rating each. On June 22 2007, "Friday Night SmackDown!" again made CW history by tying the network for first place in the key ad demographic, adults 18-49, and being the second most watched network program at 9 p.m. for the night. The CW had not performed as well at any time slot since America's Next Top Model in March 2007. The next week on June 29 2007, "Friday Night SmackDown!" helped The CW claim the top spot in the key demographic, Adults 18-49 for Friday. CBS got the overall lead but The CW got top spot for the Adults 18-49 by registering a 1.4 rating followed by CBS and NBC at 1.3, ABC at 1.2, and FOX at 0.9. Then on Friday, July 13 2007, "Friday Night SmackDown!" made network history by placing first in the 18-49 demographic and becoming the most watched show at the 9 p.m. hour on network television. This is the first time anything has placed this well on The CW. "SmackDown!" became a hit show on Friday nights winning the demographics for young males, and ranking second on the demographics (18-49) for Friday nights.

On October 16 2007 it was said that the SmackDown! and ECW brands would begin a "talent exchange", allowing their respective talent to appear and compete on either brand.

On February 8 2008 it was reported that World Wrestling Entertainment and The CW had ended agreements to keep "Friday Night SmackDown!" on the network. WWE stated that agreements with other networks has begun and that "Friday Night SmackDown!" would continue to air on The CW through the end of the 2007-2008 broadcast season. On February 26 WWE issued a press release saying "Friday Night SmackDown!"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> move to MyNetworkTV.

On July 10 2007, Merriam-Webster announced it would induct the word "smackdown" into "Webster's Dictionary". According to Merriam Webster, a "smackdown" is:

"SmackDown" is usually taped on Tuesday evening and shown Friday evening on MyNetworkTV the same week. Lately though, they have taped two episodes at a time and as a result are taped every two weeks. Sometimes, it is taped on Monday nights before or after "RAW" in what is called a "Supershow". "SmackDown" has also been shown live sometimes.

The current theme song is "If You Rock Like Me" the performing artist is not known. It was released on . One of the last theme songs for SmackDown! was ""Rise Up!"" by Drowning Pool, a remake of "SmackDown!"'s fifth anniversary instrumental theme song. It was performed by then-lead singer Jason "Gong" Jones and featured on the album, however, the theme song for the SmackDown brand from sometime during 2006 through October 2008 was ""Rise Up 2006"" by Drowning Pool, a new version of ""Rise Up!"" performed by new lead singer Ryan McCombs and featured as a bonus downloadable track on the WWE Wreckless Intent album, this theme song was eventually replaced with the already stated theme song "If You Rock Like Me" when SmackDown switched networks. A new theme, "Let it Roll" by Divide the Day, debuted on the 10 Anniversary of SmackDown episode along with a new graphics package.

"Friday Night SmackDown!" began broadcasting in HD beginning with the January 25 2008 edition of "SmackDown!", where a new set started that is shared among all three WWE brands.

The Beatles (album)

The Beatles is a 1968 album by the band of the same name, The Beatles. Its cover included no photographs, but was a simple white jacket, with the band's name onto the paper. Early copies also included a . The plain white cover led fans and listeners to call the record the "White Album". In time, even the band and their company, Apple Corps, began to use this name.

"The Beatles" was the band's twelfth album of new recordings, and was released in November 1968. While most albums of the time included ten to fourteen songs, "The Beatles" included thirty-four songs, and was sold as a two-disc set.

The Beatles began writing songs for the album while they were in India, taking a teaching course in taught by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh. They planned to become gurus, or spiritual teachers, and use their music to spread Transcendental Meditation to a wide audience. Their helpers back in England looked after their business matters, so the Beatles could have time to study, and to think about what they learned. They released a new single, "Lady Madonna", just before they left for India, so they would not be missed by their fans while they were away.

Between classes and meditation sessions, the Beatles had plenty of free time. They brought some instruments with them, including acoustic guitars, and began to write new songs. "We wrote "tons" of songs in India," John Lennon later told "Playboy" magazine. Their wives and girlfriends also came along to India. Lennon and his wife Cynthia did not spend much time together. He would leave alone in the morning, to pick up the mail. It turned out he was receiving letters and postcards from Yoko Ono, a Japanese artist friend, and did not want Cynthia to know. He said later that while he was in India, he began to think about Ono "as a woman, not just an woman", and that he might want a relationship with her.

In the end, none of the Beatles finished the course, and returned home to England. Ringo Starr did not like the spicy food served at the where the Maharishi lived and taught, and it made him ill. He also missed his children. Paul McCartney became tired of the long sessions, and wanted to return home. Lennon and George Harrison heard stories that the Maharishi had with Mia Farrow (an American actress who also took the course), and other women at the ashram. They did not think this was right for a "holy man" to do. They the Maharishi, and later left with their wives to go home, deciding the Maharishi was a fraud.

The Beatles had formed their own company, Apple Corps, before they went to India. When they returned, they went to work full-time to make Apple Corps, and especially its record label, Apple Records, a success. To raise money, the Beatles had signed a new recording contract with EMI, the company who owned Parlophone Records, which made and sold their records. They also made an agreement with EMI for them to market Apple Records.

The Beatles needed to record seventy new songs within nine years, between 1967 and 1976, to complete their contract. They believed that once they delivered those seventy recordings, they would be free to go to another record company. Between all the songs they wrote in India, and their of older songs, they knew they could finish the job. They recorded demoes of many of the songs at George Harrison's house, using his four-track tape recorder, then began work on the album at Abbey Road Studios in London.

The Beatles's record producer, George Martin, thought they should take the best of the India songs, and make one especially good album. The Beatles instead decided to make a double album, with as many songs on it as possible, to help finish their contract quickly.

The lives of the individual Beatles changed greatly during 1968, and the making of the "White Album". Paul McCartney was engaged to actress Jane Asher, but she came home early one day and found him with another woman, Francine Schwartz, an American who worked for Apple Corps. She and McCartney fought, then made up, but decided to break up later. McCartney also began to use cocaine. The drug made him hard to get along with. Later in the year he met another woman, Linda Eastman, an American photographer who had a daughter, named Heather. McCartney loved children and wanted to start a family, while Jane Asher wanted to put her acting career first. Linda boasted that she would be proud to have McCartney's children. She and McCartney became very close, very quickly.

John Lennon invited Yoko Ono to his house, while Cynthia was away on a vacation with friends, one weekend in May. The two spent a night together in Lennon's attic studio, listening to his avant-garde recordings and finally making one of their own. Lennon discovered Ono was "as barmy (crazy) as I was", and that they connected personally in a way he and Cynthia never had. They finished the recording, and had intercourse as the sun rose that morning. They woke up late the next day, in love with each other, and decided to stay together from then on, even though they were both married to other people. Lennon's wife Cynthia and Ono's husband Anthony Cox both took the news very hard, with their children (Lennon's son Julian by Cynthia, and Ono's daughter Kyoko by Cox) caught in the middle.

George Harrison had grown as a musician and songwriter, and as a celebrity. He was the youngest member of the Beatles, and always felt "under the thumb" of Lennon and McCartney. They and George Martin limited how many of Harrison's songs the Beatles recorded, and turned down many of his songs that other bands would be happy to record. This Harrison. Almost nobody outside the Beatles knew about the situation. Friends like Ravi Shankar, who was Harrison's first real music teacher, and Eric Clapton, a phenomenal guitarist himself, treated him differently. Most of the public saw Harrison as an equal with Lennon and McCartney. Harrison began to think about making his own music, away from the Beatles.

Back at Abbey Road, Ringo Starr felt out of place during the recording sessions, and that he was not needed. Paul McCartney had not liked Starr's drumming on a song, and re-recorded the part himself when Starr was not there. This hurt Starr's feelings, and he decided to leave the band. He stayed home for a week, playing with his children and deciding what he should do next with his life. The other Beatles missed him, and invited him back. When Starr returned, McCartney and Harrison had covered his drums with flowers and welcome-back messages. Starr felt loved by his bandmates, and stayed.

The changes in the band's personal lives showed in their new recordings. Instead of sounding like a band working together, the songs sounded like solo artists working with a backing group. They also began to have problems getting along. Lennon brought Ono to the studio whenever he came, breaking a rule they had never to bring wives or girlfriends to sessions. Ono, who was also a musician, spoke her mind about how the music sounded, and it took everyone else by surprise. Harrison also began to speak up more for himself, when the band played together.

Outside the studio, people who worked for the Beatles, and the Beatles's fans in England, did not like Ono's influence on Lennon, and let the couple know often, and sometimes loudly. When they attended a play based on Lennon's writings, the audience the pair, asking "Where's your wife, John?" Some members of the public made racist comments about Ono, or called her ugly. 

Ono's new presence in Lennon's life even drove a wedge between him and McCartney. When the couple stayed at McCartney's house, McCartney left Lennon a note that insulted Ono greatly. He admitted later it had only been a joke, but Lennon felt like he no longer even knew McCartney, if he could make such an insult.

Neither Lennon nor Ono could believe the way they were treated by the public, by people who worked for the Beatles, and even by Lennon's friends. They felt hurt and hated. A friend suggested they try heroin, to relieve the pain they felt. Before long, the two were addicted to the drug. It caused problems with their health, and with how they acted in public.

Recording the "White Album" took much longer than the Beatles normally spent on an album. Their label, Apple Records, was expected to make a big debut over the summer, while the album would not be ready until at least that fall. In the meantime, they recorded songs for a single, as their part of the debut. Paul McCartney visited Cynthia and Julian, at their new home. He knew they were hurt by Lennon's leaving Cynthia for Yoko Ono, and he made up a song for Julian on the way, to cheer him up. Its words went "Hey Jules, it's not so bad. Take a sad song, and make it better." This turned into "Hey Jude", which became the Beatles's biggest hit single ever, and one of the first pop songs to last longer than three minutes.

The of "Hey Jude" was "Revolution", a song by Lennon in reaction to the Soviet Union's on student protests in Czechoslovakia, the ongoing war in Vietnam, and calls around the world for a revolution against the . He hoped the band's first recording of the song would become their next single, but it was rejected as too slow and too long. He re-recorded the song, faster this time, lying on the studio floor to give the vocals more "punch". "Hey Jude" was seen as a bigger potential hit though, so "Revolution" became the B-side. The Beatles performed both songs live for an audience, and the performances appeared on "The David Frost Show" in England, and "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour" in America.

The songs appearing on the "White Album" included "Back In The USSR", McCartney's parody of songs by The Beach Boys and Chuck Berry. (Mike Love of the Beach Boys attended the Maharishi's course in India, at the same time as the Beatles.) McCartney normally played bass guitar, and Lennon rhythm guitar, on Beatles recordings, but this time McCartney played piano, with Lennon switching to bass guitar for the song.

"Dear Prudence" was about Mia Farrow's sister Prudence, who was also at the ashram in India. She spent long stretches of time meditating, and almost never came outside. Lennon wrote the song hoping to bring her out, to spend time with everyone. The guitar style he used on the song (and many songs afterwards) was the "clawhammer", a technique he learned from Donovan, another musician who went to India with them.

"Glass Onion" referenced recent songs and events in the Beatles's lives, and gave a false clue: "The Walrus was Paul". Lennon said later he'd given the line as a joke, and as a way to "say hi to Paul" McCartney. "The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill" was about another of the Maharishi's students, who left the ashram to hunt tigers, then returned to meditate. "Julia" was about Lennon's mother, who had died ten years earlier, with images of Yoko Ono, whose name means "Ocean Child" in English.

"Sexy Sadie" was about Lennon's disappointment with the Maharishi: "You made a fool of everyone." He changed "Maharishi" to "Sexy Sadie", in case the Maharishi really could use some kind of or power (or start a lawsuit) against him, but later confessed to "Rolling Stone" magazine who the song was about.

"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da" was a song by McCartney. His songs on the album varied from old-fashioned to hard rock, such as "Helter Skelter", which was about a ride. He also used fingerpicking styles on acoustic guitar, and his songs "Blackbird" and "Mother Nature's Son" included nature themes.

"While My Guitar Gently Weeps" showed Harrison's growth as a songwriter, and featured a guitar solo by Eric Clapton. It was the first time a guitar solo was played by a non-Beatle on a Beatles record. "Long Long Long" was about Harrison's rediscovery of God and spirituality as he became older. "Savoy Truffle" was about a box of Good News chocolate candies, which Clapton loved, but were harming his teeth.

Ringo Starr had tinkered with writing songs, but most were just on songs written by other people. "Don't Pass Me By" was one of his first efforts, from years earlier, and one of his first to sound original. He went on to write many other songs, in the years after the Beatles. Most were written with a partner, Vini Poncia.

The strangest recording included on the album was "Revolution 9", an avant-garde "picture of a revolution as it happens", as Lennon described later. George Harrison helped with ideas and . McCartney and George Martin did not want the track included on the album, but Lennon insisted it be used.

When the recordings were ready to be mastered, Lennon and McCartney spent forty-eight hours at Abbey Road Studios, working out the running order for the songs on the album. They took drugs to help them get through the marathon session. The band had done photo sessions during the year, but could not agree on any photos to use for the cover. They decided to go with a plain white cover, which had never been done before. They and their helpers made a of different photos, which was included as a poster with the album. Portrait photos of each member were also taken. Black-and-white prints appeared next to the song titles on the inner jacket, and colour prints were included with the poster. They did not appear together in the pictures, and this was taken later as a sign that the band was growing apart.

The album was completed, and scheduled to be released during November 1968. Coming out at nearly the same time were two "solo albums" by Lennon and Harrison, and this caused some problems. Harrison's was "Wonderwall Music", a album to the movie "Wonderwall" by director Joe Massot. Harrison had recorded parts of the album in India, and parts in England. The only other Beatle involved with the album was Ringo Starr, who played drums on a few songs, and attended the movie's with Harrison.

Lennon's album with Ono was "Two Virgins", edited down from the recording he made with Yoko Ono the first night they were together. The cover was a pair of nude photos of the couple, and it caused a lot of controversy. EMI was willing to master and press the album, but refused to print the cover or distribute any copies. Apple Records arranged for Track Records, a label owned by The Who, to issue "Two Virgins". The album was sold in a "plain brown wrapper" like pornography, and was not a hit. Only a few copies were pressed in Britain, and more copies were in America than were sold. Many people thought Lennon was trying to destroy his own public image, releasing such an album. In a way they were right. He felt that the album was an honest statement of who he "really was", appearing naked with the woman he loved.

Problems aside, "The Beatles" sold well, and was another hit for the band. The Beatles held a release party, and gave early copies of the album to people who attended. (Peter Shotton, an old friend of Lennon's who worked for Apple, was given the eighth copy pressed, as he remembered later in his .) Older people liked McCartney's traditional-sounding songs. Younger listeners liked the rock and acoustic songs on the album. Many people noticed Harrison and Starr's growth as songwriters, and that Harrison's voice sounded freer, smoother, and more confident than on earlier records.

Charles Manson, an American would-be musician with a small group of followers, heard the album in California, and thought the songs "Blackbird" and "Helter Skelter" were calls for a racial war, between African-American (black) and Caucasian (white) people. His beliefs resulted in a series of murders in Los Angeles during 1969, as he ordered members of his "Manson Family" to try to spark such a war, by committing hate crimes. Later during his trial, his lawyers tried to get John Lennon (staying in California at the time) or George Harrison to testify, but this never happened. Manson and four Family members were convicted of multiple murder. They were sentenced to be , but when the US Supreme Court overturned the death penalty, their sentences were changed to life imprisonment. None have ever been paroled.

During 1969, Allen Klein began to work for the Beatles, and for Apple Corps. He re-read the Beatles's recording contract, and pointed out that even after the band turned in their seventy new recordings to EMI, they were still under contract with them until 1976, and could not go to any other record company until then. The fact that they were so close to meeting the requirement, though, made it possible for him to re-negotiate their contract, and get them higher royalty payments.

The personal problems that had begun to show while the Beatles were making the "White Album" continued over the next year, as did problems with Apple Corps. McCartney stopped using cocaine, while Lennon and Ono tried to stop using heroin, but this did not help mend feelings between the Beatles. They finished two more albums, "Let it Be" and "Abbey Road", but the band broke apart soon afterwards, with Paul McCartney announcing in 1970 that he was starting a solo career.

In time, budget cutbacks resulted in the album's cover no longer being die-stamped (the title was printed instead) or numbered, but when it was re-issued on compact disc, early copies were again given serial numbers.

Albert Fert

Professor Albert Fert is a French physicist who was born on March 7 1938. He discovered giant magnetoresistance which was used to make gigabyte hard disks much easier to build. He is a professor at Université Paris-Sud in Orsay and scientific director of a laboratory called Unité mixte de recherche. The laboratory is part of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (National Scientific Research Centre) and Thales Group. He was awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics together with Peter Grünberg.

Professor Fert graduated in 1962 from the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. He received his master's degree in 1963 at the University of Paris, and earned his PhD in 1970 at the Université Paris-Sud.

In 1988 Fert discovered Giant magnetoresistance (GMR) in iron and chromium which began spintronics; GMR was also discovered by Peter Grünberg from the Jülich Research Centre but Peter Grünberg did not work with Professor Fert. Since 1988, Albert Fert has helped to improve spintronics.

Peter Grünberg

Professor Peter Andreas Grünberg is a German physicist who was born on May 18, 1939. Professor Grünberg won the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of giant magnetoresistance which made gigabyte hard disk drives easier to produce. Half the prize was given to Albert Fert who discovered giant magnetoresistance at the same time but Fert and Grünberg did not work together.

Grünberg was born in Pilsen, Bohemia, which was controlled by the Nazis. They called the country the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and it is known now as the Czech Republic. Grünbergs father was called Fjodor Grinberg but he changed his name to Fjodor Grünberg in 1941.

The rest of the Grünberg family stayed for some time in the Petermann house in Untersekerschan but, after World War II, all people living in Pilsen who spoke German were made to leave the country by the Czech government. This was called the Beneš decrees. He moved with his mother (who died in 2002 aged 100) and sister to Lauterbach, Hesse. He studied at a gymnasium (second level school) there.

Grünberg received a diploma in 1962 from the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University. Then he studied at the Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany, where he received his diploma in physics in 1966 and his Ph.D. in 1969. From 1969-1972, he did studied at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. Later he joined the Institute for Solid State Physics at the Jülich Research Centre, where he became a leading researcher of magnetism until he retired in 2004.

Professor Grünberg made important discoveries with ferrite (iron) and magnetism such as the Giant magnetoresistive effect (GMR) in 1988. GMR has been used in many modern hard drives. Another use of the GMR effect is in magnetic random access memory. 

Apart from the Nobel Prize, Professor Grünberg has been awarded with shared prizes in the APS International Prize for New Materials, the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics Magnetism Award, the Hewlett-Packard Europhysics Prize, the Wolf Prize in Physics in and the 2007 Japan Prize. He won the German Future Prize for Technology and Innovation in 1998 and was named European Inventor of the Year in the category "Universities and research institutions" by the European Patent Office and European Commission in 2006.

Super Mario Bros. 2 is the second game of the "Mario" series. It is the name of two different games. In Japan, the game was created by Nintendo. Shigeru Miyamoto thought that the original "" was too hard for Americans, and decided to take the game called "", and replaced the old characters with the Mario characters Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Toad. The game was much different from other Mario games because of this.

This game features four characters: Toad, Luigi, Mario, and Princess Peach. Each one has different characteristics. Luigi can jump higher than the other characters, Peach can stay afloat for longer when jumping, Toad can pull items out of the ground quicker whilst Mario has generic all-round abilities.
Peach can stay afloat for a few seconds longer than the others. 
The player can pick the character at the start of each level.

Unlike the regular Mario games, Mario and his friends have vegetables and can pick up some enemies and throw them.

<doc id="100684" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100684" title="Mario Kart: Double Dash!!">
Mario Kart: Double Dash!!

Mario Kart: Double Dash‼ is a racing game made by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development and Nintendo for the Nintendo GameCube in 2003. This is the fourth "Mario Kart" game. The third game was "Mario Kart Super Circuit". The fifth game is "Mario Kart DS" and the sixth is "Mario Kart Wii". The seventh will be "Mario Kart 3D" (for the Nintendo 3DS). 

New things have been added in this game. The most popular change is that you can play as two characters at a time. If you have a special cable for the Nintendo GameCube, you can plug it in to play against up to 15 people. 9 characters returned, while 11 new characters appeared. A special item for each character has also been added.

Lots of people liked Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. Its score on Metacritic was 87 out of 100. People liked the looks and the new characters, modes etc, but people did not like the character's voices. Lots of people liked this game. 3.8 million Mario Kart: Double Dash!! CDs were sold in the United States, and more than 802,000 Double Dash!! CDs were sold in Japan.

Double Dash‼ is different to the other "Mario Kart" games. You can now use two characters at a time. One drives and the other one uses items. You can not put an item at the back of the kart as a shield against shells, so you will have to quickly move away from them instead. This is the first game where the characters lose their items when they get hit. Players can also steal items from other characters. If a character makes blue sparks, they get a small boost (called a mini-turbo). 

Up to four people can go against each other in this game. As well as the other games, the race tracks have lots of twists and turns and things to try to drive away from. There are some mini-games in Mario Kart: Double Dash‼. Double Dash lets 16 people play against each other if one of them has a special type of cable.

There are 20 characters that you can play as. 11 of them are new to the series. Characters have their own items/special abilities. The characters speed, acceleration etc. depends on the weight. There are 16 race tracks. There is also a "150cc Mirror Cup". In Mirror Cup mode, you are still playing the normal game but looks like you are looking into a mirror and playing Mario Kart (minus your own face).

"Double Dash‼" was first shown in 2001. People saw Mario and Luigi driving their karts on a flat floor for 7 seconds. It was being made and was basically "Mario Kart" at the time. In April 2003, Nintendo showed pictures of the game and said that the game would be called "Mario Kart: Double Dash!!". In 2003, some people were able to play a demo of the game (not all characters and tracks were in it). New things, like having two characters drive one kart, had been added. A new demo with some new things was shown at the Games Convention in August 2003. In September, Nintendo showed people a nearly complete and more sped up version of "Double Dash!!". The Gamers' Summit also said that the game would be out in North America on the 17th of November, 2003.

The guys who made the game struggled to come up with new stuff the fans would like. Kiyoshi Mizuki, the main director, had a hard time with was how to hook new fans into the game; he decided to make it as simple as possible. Producer Shigeru Miyamoto gave the staff some pointers about stuff to put in the game the best they could. He let them pick out how they wanted to do the graphics.

The staff wanted to let people play online but the technology was not good enough for that yet. They also wanted to do something with a Game Boy Advance connection for this game but they decided "Double Dash!!" did not fit anything like that. They wanted to make sure the really good plaers and the not-so-good players were all able to have fun with this game, so they took out things like not slipping when you hit a banana.

The game music was made by Shinobu Tanaka and Kenta Nagata. A lot of the main "Mario" voice actors came back for this game, like Charles Martinet as Mario, Luigi, Wario, Waluigi, Baby Mario, and Baby Luigi; Jen Taylor as Princess Peach, Toad, Toadette, and Birdo; Deanna Mustard as Princess Daisy; Kazumi Totaka as Yoshi; Scott Burns as Bowser; and Dolores Rogers as Bowser Jr.

It's sold about 4.67 million times around the world, 3.8 million in the United States, and over 802,000 in Japan. The NPD Group says "Double Dash!!" was the best-selling game of November 2003. It's also the third best-selling GameCube game in Australia. In October 2006, the NPD Group said this game sold seventh best for the GameCube in the United States.

I don't know how to use Wikipedia code to make tables, so could anyone do this for me? Thanks. 10:42, 31 March 2008 (UTC)

As we tend to get a lot of copyright complaints on articles based on En:wp pages and the entire matter is a bit of a grey area, I created the template to be placed on the talk pages of articles that are created based on simplified versions of En:wp pages. The template requires the complete address of the version used as the basis for the article (and will tell you if you don't include the url) while providing a link to the version itself and informing the reader of the available history of the article. This should completely cover the reference back/history requirements under the GFDL. -- 22:44, 31 March 2008 (UTC)

Hello all,

I am a non-native speaker of English. My English is probably near that of a native. At times I wonder how quickly the English language changes. This is especially apparent in those verb/pronoun combos (called "phrasal verb"). People from different backgrounds will use the language differently. A migrant worker (who has spent his life laying bricks) will have a comletely different language use to the academic who found out he needs to learn English, because there are few scientific publications in te Kazach language in his field of study. I therefore think the most important points when writing articles are:
In the hope the meaning "gets across". -- () 11:58, 2 April 2008 (UTC)

Khan (title)

Khan (sometimes spelled as "Xan", "Han", "Ke-Han", Turkic: "khān" , Chinese:大汗) is an originally Central Asian title for a sovereign or military ruler. 
It was used by the Mongols who brought it to all over Asia.

It now has many equivalent meanings such as commander, leader, or ruler. Presently Khans exist mostly in South Asia, Central Asia and Iran. The female alternatives are Khatun and Khanum. 

A khan controls a khanate (sometimes spelled "chanat"). Whenever appropriate as ruler of a monarchy, "khan" is also translated as king or prince. (But that translation is not quite correct.) Originally khans only headed relatively minor tribes.

The title "Khan" became well known when the tribal Mongol Temüjin proved himself a military genius by creating the Mongol Empire, the greatest land empire the world ever saw, which he ruled as Genghis Khan. His title was khagan 'Khan of Khans', see below, but is often 'shortened' to Khan (rather like the Persian "Shahanshah" – also meaning 'King of Kings' – is usually called Shah, equally incorrect, in most Western languages) or described as 'Great Khan' (like the Ottoman Padishah being called 'Great Sultan').

Crime in Russia

Crime in Russia has many different forms. Organized crime include drug trafficking, money laundering, human trafficking, extortion, murder for hire, fraud etc. Many criminal operations take part in corruption, black marketeering, terrorism, abduction etc. Other forms of crime done by criminal groups are arms trafficking, export of contraband oil and metals, and smuggling of radioactive materials. Crime rate in Russia sharply increased since the late 1980s. The fall of communism in Eastern Europe had tremendous influence on the political economy of organized crime. Approximately 8,000 criminal groups are in the country. Almost 50% of the nation's economy is connected to organized crime.

Drug trafficking and illegal drug use is a big problem in the nation. The disintegration of the Soviet Union, the civil war in Afghanistan, the civil war in Tajikistan, and the conflicts in the North Caucasus have made the favorable conditions for the development of illegal drug trade. But measures have been taken to fight drug trafficking. Russia is a party of the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. In March 2003, Russian President Vladimir Putin established the Russian State Committee for Control over the 
Illegal Trafficking of Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances for combating drug trafficking with more coordinated manner. Russia is a supply, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children being trafficked for various purposes. The trafficking is multidimensional and it involves both commercial sexual exploitation and labor exploitation. Russia is a significant source of women trafficked to over 50 nations. Internal trafficking is a problem in the country; women are trafficked from rural areas to urban settlements for commercial sexual exploitation. Men are trafficked internally and from Central Asia for forced labor in the construction and agricultural industries. Debt bondage is common among the trafficking victims. Arms trafficking has become a significant problem in Russia following the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Arms trafficking in Russia stemmed from corruption in the armed forces and the illegal sale of military equipments. In 2000, the number of seized unregistered firearms was 300,000, which was a 37% increase compared with 1999. Many Russian criminal organizations, aside from arms trafficking in Russia, provide weapons to the terrorist groups in Chechnya. Poaching was rare in the Soviet Union, But now Poaching is a major problem in the country. The main cause for poaching in Russia is the consequence of the social and political changes since the collapse of the Soviet Union. State-controlled farms stopped functioning due to the fall of the previous system resulting in high unemployment. Unemployment, poverty, inflation, shortage of food and demand for foreign currency have major impact on the wildlife in the country. Animals being poached are bear, musk deer, tiger etc. Approximately 50,000 cases of poaching are registered annually in Russia. Between 1992 and 1996, law enforcement agencies in Russia mainly focused on drug trafficking, arms trafficking, money laundering and 
the First Chechen War, and environmental crimes like poaching and illegal timber smuggling were generally not treated as national security issues. During the post-perestroika transition, the government agencies for environment and wildlife protection experienced severe budget cuts which led to layoffs and salary reductions for wildlife rangers in places like Primorski Krai and it reduced the resources of the rangers to fight against the poachers. There has been an increasing demand for bear parts, especially bile, and it led to an increase in poaching of bears in the Russian Federation. The collapse of communism in the country had significant influence on the average Russian's economic ability to maintain his or her family. There are a large population of bears in Russia, and Russia's trade in bear parts is primarily with nearby Asian countries like South Korea and the People's Republic of China. Because of these poaching of bears become easy for Russians. Poaching of the snow leopard is a serious problem in Russia along with Afghanistan, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, People’s Republic of China, Russia, Tajikstan and Uzbekistan.

The murder rate in Russia has become three times as big between 1988 and 1994 and is now among the highest in the world. In 1998, a total of 24,537,600 crimes happened in United States, while in Russia a total of 2,581,940 crimes were recorded. In 1999, the number was 23,677,800 and 3,001,748 respectively. Total recorded rapes in the United States was 93,140 and 89,110 for the years 1998 and 1999, while this number was 7,724 and 7,314 respectively for Russia. 
Following is a comparison of various crimes per 1000 people from 1998 to 2000:

Crime in India

Crime is present in various forms in India. Organized crime include drug trafficking, gunrunning, money laundering, extortion, murder for hire, fraud, human trafficking and poaching. Many criminal operations engage in black marketeering, political violence, religiously motivated violence, terrorism, and abduction. Other crimes are homicide, robbery, assault etc. Property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson. Corruption is a significant problem.

India is located between two major illicit opium producing centres in Asia - the Golden Crescent comprising Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran and the Golden Triangle comprising Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos. Because of such geographical location, India experiences large amount of drug trafficking through the borders. India is the world's largest producer of licit opium. But opium is diverted to illicit international drug markets. India is a transshipment point for heroin from Southwest Asian countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan and from Southeast Asian countries like Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand. Heroin is smuggled from Pakistan and Burma, with some quantities transshipped through Nepal. Most heroin shipped from India are destined for Europe. There have been reports of heroin smuggled from Mumbai to Nigeria for further export. In Maharashtra, Mumbai is an important centre for distribution of drug. The most commonly used drug in Mumbai is Indian heroin (called "desi mal" by the local population). Both public transportation (road and rail transportation) and private transportation are used for this drug trade.

Several measures have been taken by the Government of India to combat drug trafficking in the country. India is a party of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961), the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971), the Protocol Amending the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1972) and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988).

According to a joint report published by Oxfam, Amnesty International and the International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA) in 2006, there are around 40 million illegal small arms in India out of approximately 75 million in worldwide circulation. Majority of the illegal small arms make its way into the states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. In India, an used AK-47 costs $3,800 in black market. Large amount of illegal small arms are manufactured in various illegal arms factories in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and sold on the black market for as little as $5.08. Chinese pistols are in demand in the illegal small arms market in India because they are easily available and cheaper. This trend poses a significant problem for the states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh which are affected by Naxalism. The porous Indo-Nepal border is an entry point for Chinese pistols, AK-47 and M-16 rifles into India as these arms are used by the Naxalites who have ties to Maoists in Nepal.

Illegal wildlife trade in India has increased. According to a report published by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) in 2004, India is the chief target for the traders of wildlife skin. Between 1994 and 2003, there have been 784 cases where the skins of tiger, leopard or otter have been seized. Leopards, rhinoceros, reptiles, birds, insects, rare species of plants are being smuggled into the countries in Southeast Asia and the People's Republic of China. Between 1994 and 2003, poaching and seizure of 698 otters have been documented in India. Kathmandu is a key staging point for illegal skins smuggled from India bound for Tibet and PRC. The report by EIA noted there has been a lack of cross-border cooperation between India, Nepal and the People's Republic of China to coordinate enforcement operations and lack of political will to treat wildlife crime effectively. The poaching of the elephants is a significant problem in Southern India and in the North-Eastern states of Nagaland and Mizoram. The majority of tiger poaching happens in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Orissa, West Bengal, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. 

Project Tiger, a wildlife conservation project, was initiated in 1972 and was launched by Indira Gandhi on April 1, 1973. With 23 tiger reserves, Project Tiger claimed to have succeeded. But according to critics like conservationist Billy Arjan Singh, temporary increases in tiger population were caused by immigration due to destruction of habitat in Nepal, not because of the widely acclaimed success of wildlife policy in India.

Cases of spam, computer hacking, cyber stalking and email fraud are rampant in India. The Information Technology Act 2000 was passed by the Parliament of India in May 2000, aiming to curb cyber crimes and provide a legal framework for e-commerce transactions. However Pavan Duggal, lawyer of Supreme Court of India and cyber law expert, viewed "The IT Act, 2000, is primarily meant to be a legislation to promote e-commerce. It is not very effective in dealing with several emerging cyber crimes like cyber harassment, defamation, stalking and so on". Although cyber crime cells have been set up in major cities, Duggal noted the problem is that most cases remain unreported due to a lack of awareness. In 2001, India and United States had set up an India-US cyber security forum as part of a counter-terrorism dialogue. In 2006, India and the US agreed to enhance cooperation between law enforcement agencies of the two countries in tackling cyber crimes as part of counter-terrorism efforts. A joint US-India statement released in 2006 after talks between US President George W. Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh stressed that in view of the importance of cyber security and cyber forensic research, the two countries are also carrying out discussions on a draft protocol on cyber security.

Corruption is widespread in India. It is prevalent within every section and every level of the society. Corruption has taken the role of a pervasive aspect of Indian politics. In India, corruption takes the form of bribes, evasion of tax and exchange controls, embezzlement, etc. 

Despite state prohibitions against torture and custodial misconduct by the police, torture is widespread in police custody, which is a major reason behind deaths in custody. The police often torture innocent people until a 'confession' is obtained to save influential and wealthy offenders. G.P. Joshi, the programme coordinator of the Indian branch of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative in New Delhi comments that the main issue at hand concerning police violence is a lack of accountability of the police.

In 2006, the Supreme Court of India in an judgment in the "Prakash Singh vs. Union of India" case, ordered central and state governments with seven directives to begin the process of police reform. The main objectives of this set of directives was twofold, providing tenure to and streamlining the appointment/transfer processes of policemen, and increasing the accountability of the police.

In 2006, seven policemen were charge sheeted and eleven were convicted for custodial misconduct.

A report published by the National Crime Records Bureau compared crime rate from 1953 to 2006. The report noted burglary has been declined over a period of 53 years by 38% (from 1,47,379 in 1953 to 91,666 in 2006), whereas murder has increased by 231% (from 9,803 in 1953 to 32,481 in 2006). Kidnapping has increased by 356% (from 5,261 in 1953 to 23,991 in 2006), robbery by 120% (from 8,407 in 1953 to 18,456 in 2006) and riots by 176% (from 20,529 in 1953 to 56,641 in 2006).

In 2006, 51,02,460 cognizable crimes were committed including 18,78,293 Indian Penal Code (IPC) crimes and 32,24,167 Special & Local Laws (SLL) crimes, with an increase of 1.5% over 2005 (50,26,337). IPC crime rate in 2006 was 167.7 compared to 165.3 in 2005 showing an increase of 1.5% in 2006 over 2005. SLL crime rate in 2006 was 287.9 compared to 290.5 in 2005 showing an decline of 0.9% in 2006 over 2005.

Crime against foreigners in India

As in any other country in the world there are incidents of violent crime against foreigner in India. Scams involving export of jewels occur in India, which target foreign citizens.

Political demonstrations are common in India. These demonstrations sometimes turn violent. Transportation and services often get disrupted. Traveling alone in remote areas after dark is of particular risks for foreigners. As in any other country, take precautions. Be aware of your surroundings. Just as any other country, cities in India have safe and unsafe areas.

Tourist locations and markets are visited by criminals looking to target foreigners. Westerners, including U.S. citizens, have become victim of robbery, rape and other violent attacks.

Because the foreigners purchasing power is relatively large than the general population, foreigners become more preferred target for robbery or other serious crime.

In April 1999, Swaraj Damree, a tourist from Mauritius was befriended by a group of Indians who later took him to 25 days in captivity. They robbed him of cash amounting to US $1,500, took his travellers' cheques, wrist watch, gold chain, bracelet, two bags and suitcase. In 2000, two German trekkers were shot in Himachal Pradesh. Few weeks later, two Spanish tourists were killed in Himachal Pradesh by robbers. Many foreign tourists are victim of violent crime in Kolkata. In September 2006, criminals robbed the wallet of a British woman in Kolkata. The same month, a Japanese tourist was robbed on his way to Sudder Street. In October 2006, a foreigner was robbed in daylight on Park Street.

Petty crime, like pickpocketing, bag snatching etc. are widespread in India. Stealing of valuables of foreigners from luggage on trains and buses is common. Travelers who are not in groups become easy victims of pickpockets and purse snatchers. Purse snatchers work in crowded areas.

In India, stealing of passport of foreigners from luggage on trains and buses is widespread. Theft of U.S. passports is very common, especially in major tourist areas.

Many scams are perpetrated against foreign travelers, especially in Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan. Scams usually target younger foreign tourists and suggest them that money can be made by privately transporting gems or gold or by taking delivery abroad of expensive carpets avoiding customs duties.

Such incidents pull the traveler over the course of several days and begin with a new scam artist who offers to show the foreign traveler the sights. They also offer cheap lodgings and meals to foreign travellers so that they can place the traveler in the physical custody of the scam artist and can leave the foreigner with threats and physical coercion. In the due process, the foreigner lose his passport.

In 2006, an American became victim of a scam at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai, by which she lost US $77.

There are also taxi scams present in India where a foreign traveler, who is not aware of the locations around Indian airports, is taken for a ride round the whole airport and charged for full-fare taxi ride while the terminal is only few hundred yards away. Overseas Security Advisory Council in a report mentioned the process about how to avoid taxi-scam.

Incidents of rape of foreign tourists at popular tourist spots is increasing in India. In March 2006, Biti Mohanty, son of a senior police official in Orissa, raped a German tourist in Alwar, Rajasthan. A Japanese woman was raped in Pushkar, Rajasthan on April 2, 2006. In June 2007, a South Korean was raped near Manali. In September 2007, two Japanese women were gang-raped in Agra, a popular tourist-spot in India where the Taj Mahal is situated. The Indian state of Rajasthan is a popular destination among foreign tourists with one out of every three foreign travellers coming to India visit the state. Rajasthan has been rattled by rape cases of foreign tourists. Bureau of Consular Affairs warned US women not to travel alone in India.

British War Medal

The British War Medal was a medal given to people who had fought in the First World War. The medal was originally meant to be for people who had fought in the war between 5th August1914 and 11th November1918, but this was later changed to the years between 1914 and 1920. This was because a lot of people still lost their lives in the armed forces even after the war had ended, because they were clearing landmines or mines at sea.

The British War Medal (often shortened to BWM) was awarded to both officers and men of the Royal Marines, Royal Navy, the Army and also the Dominion and Colonial Forces. The Dominion and Colonial Forces were the armed forces for the rest of the British Empire. To qualify for (be allowed to have) the medal, a member of the fighting forces had to have left his native country in any part of the British Empire whilst on military duty.

There were over six and a half million British War Medals given out. Most of them are made of silver, but some rarer ones are made of bronze instead. They are all circular, and have different designs on each side. Each side of a medal is called a "face". The face that usually has a picture of the side view of a person's head on it is called the "obverse", and the other side of the medal is called the "reverse". The picture of the person's head is more commonly known as a "bust", which is a type of statue that only shows the head, neck and tops of the shoulders of the person it is meant to be.

The "obverse" side of the medal shows a bust of King George V (V is a Roman numeral. Here it means 'the fifth'). The picture shows him facing left. There is also lettering around the picture of the King, which reads 'GEORGIVS V BRITT : OMN : REX ET IND : IMP :'. The 'V' in 'GEORGIVS' is actually read as a 'U'. The whole message is abbreviated, or shortened, and is supposed to read 'Georgius V Britanniarum Omnium; Rex Et Indiae; Imperator'. The message is written in Latin, but in English it says 'George 5th of all the Britons (British people); King of India; Emperor'.

The "reverse" side of the medal shows a man riding on a rearing horse. The man shown is Saint George, the patron saint of England. He is shown naked, and is holding a short sword. This was supposed to symbolise the mental and physical strength that was needed to win the First World War. The horse is trampling a shield that showns the emblem of Prussia and the Axis Powers, which were the enemies the British and other Allies were fighting during World War One (the First World War). The horse is also trampling on a skull and cross-bones, and the rising sun, known as the Victory Sun can be seen by St. George's head. The dates '1914' and '1918' are on the left and right sides of his head.

The name of the soldier whose medal it was had his name, regiment and armed forces identification number put around the rim (edge) of the medal. The medal also came with a ribbon made of silk. It had a thick line of golden-yellow down the middle of it, with stripes on either side of it that were white, then black, then Royal blue on the outside edges of the ribbon.

Michel Fourniret

Michel Fourniret (born April 4, 1942 in Sedan, France) is a French criminal. He was convicted of voyeurism and other crimes in 1986. He abducted and raped the then 14 year old "Daphne Le Gennan". He was convicted to serve 7 years in prison. He was released on bail shortly after the process, because he had already served most of this time in custody. Shortly thereafter, he committed his first murder. He murdered the 17 year old "Isabelle Laville". He then moved ot Belgium and lead a normal life. He was responsible for a canteen at a school in Gedine. 

On July 26, 2003, he tried to abduct a 13 year old girl, called "Marie-Ascension". Unfortunately for him, the girl could escape, by leaping out of his car. Fourniret was arrested in Belgium in the same year. Belgian police had grown suspicious earlier though; in April 2001, a woman said she had been chased and harassed in south-Belgium. She gave a description that matched Fourniret, and also cited the license plate of his car. Only 3 weeks later, a thirteen-year old girl, "Mananya Thumpong" vanished in Sedan. Since then, Fourniret has confessed he killed her. 

On July 1, 2004, Fourniret's wife, Monique Olivier, confessed. According to her account, Michel Fourniret had killed ten people. She said she had helped him with the abductions. She had also watched him rape his victims. The day after her confession, Michel said he had indeed killed eight people. Later he confessed to killing his ninth victim. Today, people believe he might have killed many more. 

He is currently detained in Belgium. His trial began on March 27, 2008. It is set to last for two months.

His wife, Monique Olivier, denounced him following the conviction of Michelle Martin, wife of convicted child murderer Marc Dutroux for helping him with the crimes. Fourniret has been charged with the abduction of minors and sexual misconduct, and has been in detention since June 2003 for the attempted kidnapping of a 14-year-old girl in 2000. Monique has been charged with one murder and for helping him with a further six. 


Fourniret's wife has also said that he killed a 16-year-old girl who had worked as an au pair at their house. Fourniret allegedly killed her in 1993, but this has not been confirmed. The identity of this alleged victim is not known.

Fourniret has been sentenced to "life in prison". This is the most severe punishmet the judges can give. He can apply for parole after 30 years. His wife, Olivier was found to be the driving force behind the murders. She has also been given a life sentence. She can ask for parole for the first time after 28 years.

Pontius Pilate

Pontius Pilate was the governor of the Roman province of Judaea from 26 AD until 36. 

He was the sixth Procurator of Judaea. In modern times he is best known as the man who presided over the Trial of Jesus and ordered his crucifixion.

Pilate appears in all four canonical Christian Gospels. Mark, showing Jesus to be innocent of plotting against Rome, portrays Pilate as extremely reluctant to execute Jesus. The Jewish hierarchy was responsible for his death. In Matthew, Pilate washes his hands of Jesus and reluctantly sends him to his death. In Luke, Pilate not only agrees that Jesus did not conspire against Rome but King Herod also finds nothing treasonous in Jesus' actions. In John, Jesus makes no claim to be the Son of Man or the Messiah to Pilate or to the Sanhedrin.

Tacitus mentions in his Annales (15,44): "Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus".

Philo of Alexandria (Leg. ad Caj. 38) and Flavius Josephus (Antiq. 18:3, 4 and Bell. II:9, 2-4) also mention him.

Pilate's biographical details before and after his appointment to Judaea are unknown, but have been supplied by tradition, which include the detail that his wife's name was Procula (she is canonized as a saint in the Greek Orthodox Church).

Pilate's term serves as a reliable historical benchmark for Jesus' death.

i am [[ar:مستخدم:محمد مصطفي عوده]] admin in arabic wikipidia, please flage by bot , it works on interwikes by pywikipedia 

Meta bot request

I'm on Wikipedia as SBHarris, and just discovered Simple English Wikipedia. Kick me if this has been suggested someplace else, but it occurs to me that what Simple English Wikipedia needs, is a lot of robotic flagging of articles to see which of their component words are part of the [[Basic English]] 850, or 1500, or derivatives thereof (a much longer list). The output might give words in three different colors, for example.

It would be most useful if a user had some way of running the `bot repetitively on an article, while editing it. The best place for the bot to run in the background, would obviously be to have it run every time the user did a "show preview." Results would come up very much like the "linked" or "unlinked" colors now used for THOSE purposes.

For this reason, such a "bot" would really ideally be part of the mediawiki software that runs this place. So this would more than a bot, but change in the basic software. But anything (even a bot which runs once a day and checks all articles) would help.

Without a lot of experience, it's quite difficult for the average native English speaker to tell if words below a certain complexity are part of the Basic English 850 or 1500 list. However, with these things automatically flagged by bot, it IS easy, even for inexperienced people to spot target words outside basic English, and then to make a decision if there is some shorter and more basic replacement that works as well, or if the word needs to stand "as is."

Won't one of your considerate 'bot makers (or you software mogels who did the original programming for this Version) consider working on this? It really would change everything here.

Addendum: I can think of more complex stuff, and most of these ideas apparently aren't as creative as I thought, since a friend of mine also came up with most of them, even as I was explaining the problem, before I'd gotten to my solutions. (So something of this sort has got to happen here eventually-- it's only a matter of WHEN, not IF). Here's a related Bot solution: There is need for a Reverse Thesaurus Bot, which is a normal thesaurus but with the Basic English word or phrase as a "redirect". This would not only flag words as not being part of BE 850 or BE 1500, but then also, for lots of words, might be able to give the Basic English word or phrase which is the "suggested replacement." There is probaby such a thing already in print form, for writers of Basic English literature. But the process needs badly to be automated here, and probably could be. Here if nowhere else!

Some users operate Bots that will go through and make repetitive changes like what you are doing with the "Other Websites" sections. You are of course free to continue making those changes, but, if you wanted, you could hold off and let the bots make those changes. If you wanted to ask a bot owner to make the changes or wanted more info on bots, see [[Wikipedia:Bots]]. Didn't know if you would be interested or not. Thanks - 19:40, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

An early name for the town was "Paese Novo" (New Country in Italian). In 1917 the city changed name to Rosignano Solvay, where the name "Solvay" originates from the name of a big chemical factory from Belgium, the Solvay Group, which in 1914 built many buildings for treating and making chemicals, such as: Sodium hydroxide, Sodium bicarbonate and Sodium carbonate.

Diplom

Diplom (from Greek Δίπλωμα "diploma") is a high level degree awarded for learning. It is awarded in European countries such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Estonia, Croatia, Serbia, Ukraine, Belarus and Greece. It is a similar award to the Bachelor's and Master's degrees in other countries. 

The Diplom was first awarded when the "Technische Hochschulen" became a university. 

The diplom is slowly being replaced by a system that awards Bachelor's and Master's degrees. Bachelor's degrees, sometimes called "Bakkalaureus" in Germany, are thought of as a "small Diplom".

The Diplom may be awarded by the two types of German university. At a University of Applied Sciences (Fachhochschule), the diploma degree is called a "Diplom (FH)" and normally takes four years to study and gain work experience. At a "Universität" the degree is called a "Diplom" or sometimes a "Diplom (Univ.)" and takes four or five years. These years are called "regular study time" ("Regelstudienzeit") but study for the universität normally takes longer.

The "Diplom" is the first university award for many students. There has been no Bachelor's degree in the German/Austrian educational system. 

To win the Diplom certificate, a student must pass the tests for the "Hauptstudium" (main study time) after the "Vordiplom", then one or more "Studienarbeit" (study research projects), and then write a "Diplomarbeit" (diploma thesis). The of diplom studies at a University of Applied Sciences (Fachhochschule) is focused on using (applying) the science. The Universität is focused on learning.

A student must have a "Diplom" before studying for a PhD ("Doctorate"). The diplom qualifies a student to study for a doctorate in most other countries.

This chart is a guide to the number of years of university study needed in a diplom system to begin studying for a doctorate:

Note: For the Diplom (FH) a student has to spend two years with a company where he or she does not study before studying for a doctorate. These years are shown as "additional work" in the table.

Also note: A Diplom student can begin the doctorate without the additional work if their work has been good enough. Normally a Master's course is taken before a doctorate.

Gupta Empire

The Gupta Empire was ruled by members of the Gupta dynasty from around 320 to 550 AD and covered most of North-central India, Gupta Empire (never included Pakistan); and what is now western India and Bangladesh. The time of the Gupta Empire is referred to as Golden Age of India in science, mathematics, astronomy, religion and philosophy. Historians place the Gupta dynasty alongside with the Han Dynasty, Tang Dynasty and Roman Empire as a model of a classical civilization.

Most probably the Guptas is that the Guptas came from Bengal. 
At the beginning of the 4th century the Guptas ruled a few small Hindu kingdoms in Magadha and around modern-day Uttar Pradesh.

We get plenty of information about this dynasty through coins, inscriptions, monuments and Sanskrit writings. 
The Gupta rulers were great conquerors and good administrators. This brought on economic prosperity which led to cultural expansion.
Gupta society was ordered in accordance with Hindu beliefs. This included a strict class system (varna system). A series of invasions weakened the empire, but many of their cultural and intellectual achievements were saved and transmitted to other cultures and live on today. 

The Gupta dynasty ruled the Gupta Empire of India, from around 320 to 550.

Some of its main rulers were:



+Golden Coins
The Guptas were the first to introduce a coinage across their empire.This showed both their wealth-as some coins were trying to unify the empire by using the same coins over the empire.

<doc id="100841" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100841" title="Portman Road">
Portman Road

Portman Road is an association football stadium in Ipswich, Suffolk, England. It has been the home ground of Ipswich Town F.C. since 1884. The stadium has also hosted one senior England friendly international match. It has staged several other sports events including athletics meetings and international hockey matches. The stadium has also held several music concerts, including performances from R.E.M. and Elton John. 

The stadium was changed a lot in the early 2000s. This increased the number of people it could hold from 22,600 to 30,311. It is the largest capacity football stadium in East Anglia. The record number of people in the ground of 38,010 was set in an FA Cup match against Leeds United in 1975. The stadium also has conference and food facilities, the "Sir Bobby Robson Suite", "Legends Bar" and a club store selling Ipswich Town souvenirs.

Portman Road was used by the local cricket team since 1855. In 1884 Ipswich Town F.C. moved from another area of Ipswich to ground. Both teams shared the ground during the summer. The first professional football team to play at the ground was Preston North End in 1892. They played a match against a Suffolk County Football Association team. A temporary bleacher was built for the visit of Aston Villa in 1898. Over 5,000 people watched the match. In 1901, a tobacco factory was built along one side of the pitch.

A wooden bleacher called "The Chicken Run" was built along the side of the pitch in 1906. Four years later, two amateur England international games were played at Portman Road. The First World War led the British Army to use the ground for training. A lot of work had to be done to repair the pitch when they left in 1920. During the 1920s, the ground hosted greyhound races to raise money. In 1936, when Ipswich Town F.C. turned professional, the cricket club left the ground.

Portman Road was home to Ipswich Town's first Football League match on 27 August 1938. Ipswich won 4–2 against Southend United in front of more than 19,000 spectators. The fans helped pay for more improvements like concrete bleachers in 1952 which meant the ground could hold over 29,000 people. Floodlights were built in 1960, and Ipswich's first televised match was held two years later.

The "Portman Stand" was built in 1971. This increased the ground's capacity to over 37,000. After the Hillsborough disaster, all bleachers had to be all-seater by law. This meant all terraces had to be converted and the capacity was reduced to about 22,000. Statues of previous Ipswich Town managers Bobby Robson and Sir Alf Ramsey were put outside the stadium in the 1990s. After Ipswich were promoted in 2000 to the Premier League, the ground was expanded to its current capacity of just over 30,000.

The pitch is by four all-seater bleachers: the North Stand, the Cobbold Stand, the Greene King Stand and the Britannia Stand. The main section of Cobbold Stand, which used to be called the Portman Stand, was built in 1971. The Britannia Stand was built in 1952 as a concrete seating area. It was updated in 1990. The North Stand was completely rebuilt in 2001 and has a capacity of around 7,500.

The current groundsman, Alan Ferguson, has been given several awards. They include both Premiership and Championship Groundsman of the Year. The pitch was voted the best in the Championship for two consecutive seasons in 2004 and 2005.

The stadium is about from Ipswich railway station. The station is on the main line from London Liverpool Street to Norwich. The stadium has no parking facilities for supporters.

On 20 August 2003, Portman Road hosted its only senior England match. It was a friendly against Croatia, which finished 3–1 to England in front of 28,700 people. The stadium has been used by England youth teams several times. The first time was on 24 November 1971. The England U23 team drew 1–1 with Switzerland. 

Other sports have been hosted at Portman Road, including athletics in 1927, an American football match in 1953, and several international hockey matches in the 1960s and 70s.

The stadium has also hosted several music concerts, including performances by Elton John, R.E.M., Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Rod Stewart. In March 2005, around 8,000 Christians went to the stadium. This was the largest act of Christian worship in Suffolk since American evangelist Billy Graham used Portman Road on part of his tour in 1984.

The most people to watch a football match at Portman Road is 38,010 for a match against Leeds United in the FA Cup sixth round on 8 March 1975. The record modern (all-seated) attendance is 30,152, set on 21 December 2003 against Norwich City in the Football League Championship. The largest ever crowd for a non-competitive game at the ground was 23,284 for Bobby Robson's testimonial match where Ipswich, including George Best, played against an England XI.

The highest seasonal average at the stadium since Ipswich turned professional was 26,431 in the 1976–77 season. The lowest average attendance at Portman Road was 8,741 in the club's first professional season, the 1936–37 season. The highest total seasonal attendance was in the 1980–81 season when the total was more than 814,000. 

Portman Road hosted Ipswich Town's first appearance in European football competition when they defeated Floriana of Malta 10–0 in the European Cup in 1962. Since then, Ipswich Town remain undefeated at Portman Road in all European competitions. They have played a total of 31 matches over 40 years, a world record until it was beaten by AZ Alkmaar in December 2007.

Azua Province

Azua is a Dominican province; it is in the southern part of the country, along the Caribbean coast. Its capital city is Azua de Compostela.

After the Dominican independence from Haiti, Azua was one of the five original provinces of the country; all the southwestern part of the country was part of this province, including some regions that now are part of Haiti.

Azua has the La Vega province to the northeast, the San José de Ocoa and Peravia provinces to the east, the Caribbean Sea to the south, the Barahona and Baoruco provinces to the west, and the San Juan province to the northwest.

The province takes the name from its capital city, Azua de Compostela. "Azua" was the Taíno name of the region where the city was founded.

There were people living in the region since a very long time, most of them along the coast. When the Spanish people came here, only Taínos were living here.

During colonial times, Azua de Compostela was one of the most important city of the Hispaniola island because there were several factories to produce sugar. Hernán Cortés, conquistador of Mexico, was one of the persons who lived here for some time.

After the independence in 1844, there were several important battles in this region between the Haitian and Dominican armies and Azua de Compostela was burned several times by the Haitian armies.

In 2002 (last national census), there were 208,857 people living in the Azua province, and 113,988 (54.6%) living in towns and cities. The population density was 82.5 persons/km².

The estimated population in the province for 2007 was of 234,741 inhabitants: 122,021 men and 112,720 women, for a population density of 85.56 persons/km².

The Azua province has a total area of 2,531.77 km². It has 5.2% of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 5th (out of 31 provinces plus the National District) largest province.

Most of the Azua province is in a very dry valley (the "Azua Valley" or "Azua Plain"); cacti and other plants of dry regions are common in this valley.

The "Cordillera Central" (in English, "Central mountain range") runs along the northern half of the province. To the east, there is the "Sierra de Ocoa" (part of the Cordillera Central) that separates this province from the Peravia province. To the west, there are the "Sierra Martín García" and "Sierra de Neiba".

The most important rivers are the Yaque del Sur and its tributaries Las Cuevas and Grande or Del Medio. Other rivers are Ocoa, Jura and Vía (that flows through the city of Azua de Compostela).

The only important road in the province is the "Carretera Sánchez" (Sánchez National Road) that goes through the southern part of the province; the road goes from Santo Domingo to the western part of the country, to the border with Haiti.

The other roads are not so important and they go from the different municipalities or municipal districts to the Carretera Sánchez or to the city of Azua de Compostela.

The Azua port is in the municipal district of Puerto Viejo; it is a small port. 

There are ten municipalities and 22 municipal districts in the province. The municipalities and its municipal districts (M.D.) are:

The main economic activity in the province is farming. In the valley, the most important crops are and the main products are banana, plantain, vegetables and fruits like mango. High on the northern mountains, coffee and beans are important products.

Fishing is important along the Caribbean coast.

Golden Age of India

Many periods have been called golden periods in the History of India, because there were different important achievements at different times. 

The period between the 3rd century and 6th century CE is known as the Golden Age of India because of the large achievements Indians made in the fields of mathematics, astronomy, science, religion and philosophy during the Gupta Empire. The decimal numeral system, including the concept of zero, was invented in India during this period. The peace and prosperity created under leadership of Guptas made remarkable scientific and artistic activities in India possible. The Golden Age in India came to an end when the Hunas invaded the Gupta Empire in the 6th century CE.

South India in the 10th and 11th century CE under the imperial Chola Dynasty has been called Golden Age as well. The period saw extensive achievements in architecture, Tamil literature, sculpture and bronze working, maritime conquests with extensive trade, and quasi-democratic reforms.

Super Mario Sunshine

In this game, Mario and his friends have landed in Delfino Isle for a vacation. However, the people on the island imprison Mario. Someone who looks like Mario has been making the island dirty. A judge tells Mario to clean up the island. He is given a device called FLUDD (Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device), which Mario straps on his back. FLUDD is a powerful water device that can clean up the mess that the fake Mario has caused.

Eventually, Mario learns that Bowser Jr., the son of Bowser, was the one who was dirtying the island. Bowser Jr. thinks that Princess Peach is his mother and kidnaps her. Mario must rescue her.

Like "Super Mario 64", there are many worlds and each world has several goals to meet. Instead of stars, Mario captures Shine Sprites that will help restore the island. Each world has a boss to defeat. As Mario clears each world, he unlocks others.

Mario must clean up acres and acres of sludge and flith that is on the island. FLUDD allows him to do this. FLUDD only has a small quantity of water and Mario must jump into a pool of water after the water runs out. FLUDD also has several other things it can do. If Mario aims the nozzles down, Mario can float for a few seconds until the water runs out.
There are also areas where Mario takes FLUDD off and jumps around himself without assistance. The first time he goes he has to go through the area with no assistance. The second time he goes, he has to collect eight red coins in a time limit.

FLUDD is always equipped with two nozzles.
FLUDD has three nozzles:

The Squirt Nozzle (the default nozzle) and the Hover Nozzle, the Rocket Nozzle, and the Turbo Nozzle.

African elephant

African elephants are the two species of elephants in the genus Loxodonta, one of the two existing genera in Elephantidae. Although it is commonly believed that the genus was named by Georges Cuvier in 1825, Cuvier spelled it "Loxodonte". An anonymous author romanized the spelling to "Loxodonta" and the ICZN recognizes this as the proper authority.

Fossil "Loxodonta" have only been found in Africa, where they developed in the middle Pliocene.

Males stand 3.64 meters (12 feet) tall at the shoulder and weigh 5455 kg (12,000 lbs), while females stand 3 meters (10 feet) and weigh 3636 kg to 4545 kg (8,000 to 10,000 lbs) . The largest bulls will weigh 24,000 pounds(12 tons)and stand a little over (13 feet) at the shoulder.

Elephants have four molars, each weighs about 11 lbs and measures about 12 inches long. The front pair wear down and drop out in pieces as the Two new molars emerge in the back of the mouth and the old molars shift forward. to replace those that dropped out. Elephants replace their teeth six times. At about 40 to 60 years of age the elephant no longer has teeth and will likely die of starvation, a common cause of death.

Their tusks are teeth, the second set of incisors become the tusks. They are used for digging for roots and stripping the bark off trees for food, and, fighting each other during mating season, or defending themselves against predators. They weigh from 50-100 pounds and can be from can be from 5 to 8 feet long. Both bulls and cows have tusks.


Bush and Forest Elephants were formerly considered subspecies of the same species "Loxodonta africana". However, they are nowadays generally considered to be two distinct species . The African Forest Elephant has a longer and narrower mandible, rounder ears, a different number of toenails, straighter and downward tusks, and considerably smaller size. With regard to the number of toenails: the African Bush Elephant normally has 4 toenails on the front foot and 3 on the hind foot, the African Forest Elephant normally has 5 toenails on the front foot and 4 on the hind foot (like the Asian elephant), but hybrids between the two species commonly occur.

Poaching significantly reduced the population of "Loxodonta" in certain regions during the 20th century. An example of this poaching pressure is in the eastern region of Chad—elephant herds there were substantial as recently as 1970, with an estimated population of 400,000; however, by 2006 the number had dwindled to about 10,000. The African elephant nominally has governmental protection, but poaching is still a serious issue. 

Human encroachment into or adjacent to natural areas where bush elephants occur has led to recent research into methods of safely driving groups of elephants away from humans, including the discovery that playback of the recorded sounds of angry honey bees are remarkably effective at prompting elephants to flee an area. Some elephant communities have grown so large, in Africa, that some communities have resulted to culling large amounts to help sustain the ecosystem.
All in all African elephants are some of the smartest land animales in the world.

History of the United Kingdom

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the sovereign state. England, Scotland, Wales (together Great Britain) and Northern Ireland are parts of this state. 

It began to take its present shape with the Acts of Union in 1707, which united the crowns and Parliaments of England and Scotland to create the Kingdom of Great Britain. A further Act of Union in 1800 joined the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

In 1922, the territory of what is now the Republic of Ireland gained independence, and only Northern Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. As a result, in 1927 Britain changed its formal title to "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland", usually shortened to "the United Kingdom", "the UK" or "Britain".

For history before the creation of the United Kingdom see:


The first step towards political unification were taken on May 1st, 1707, shortly after the parliaments of Scotland and England had approved Acts of Union which combined the two parliaments and the two royal titles. 

Perhaps the greatest single benefit to Scotland of the Union was that Scotland could enjoy free trade with England and her colonies overseas. For England's part, a possible ally for European states that were hostile to England had been neutralized. 

Certain aspect of the former independent kingdoms remained separate. Examples of Scottish and English institutions which were not merged into the British system include: Scottish and English law which remain separate, as do Scottish and English banking systems, the Presbyterian Church of Scotland and Anglican Church of England also remained separate as did the systems of education and higher learning. 

As the Scots were better educated than the average Englishman, they made a disproportionate contribution to both the government of the United Kingdom and the administration of the British Empire.

The second stage in the development of the United Kingdom took effect on January, 1st, 1801, when the Kingdom of Great Britain merged with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

The legislative union of Great Britain and Ireland was completed under the Act of Union 1800. The country's name was changed to "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland". The Act was passed in the British and therefore unrepresentative Irish Parliament with substantial majorities achieved in part (according to contemporary documents) through bribery, namely the awarding of peerages and honors to critics to get their votes. The separate Parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland were abolished, and replaced by a united Parliament of the United Kingdom. Ireland thus became part of an extended United Kingdom. Ireland sent around 100 MPs to the House of Commons at Westminster and 28 peers to the House of Lords. 

Hostilities between Great Britain and France recommenced on May 18 1803. The Coalition war-aims changed over the course of the conflict: a general desire to restore the French monarchy became closely linked to the struggle to stop Napoleon.
The Napoleonic conflict had reached the point at which subsequent historians could talk of a "world war". Only the Seven Years' War offered a precedent for widespread conflict on such a scale.

The Victorian era marked the height of the British Industrial Revolution and the of the British Empire. Although commonly used to refer to the period of Queen Victoria's rule between 1837 and 1901, scholars debate whether the Victorian period—as defined by a variety of sensibilities and political concerns that have come to be associated with the Victorians—actually begins with the passage of Reform Act 1832. The era was preceded by the Regency era and succeeded by the Edwardian period. The latter half of the Victorian era roughly coincided with the first portion of the Belle Époque era of continental Europe and other non-English speaking countries.
Prime Ministers: William Pitt the Younger | Lord Grenville | Duke of Portland | Spencer Perceval | Lord Liverpool | George Canning | Lord Goderich | Duke of Wellington | Lord Grey | Lord Melbourne | Sir Robert Peel | Lord John Russell | Lord Derby | Lord Aberdeen | Lord Palmerston | Benjamin Disraeli | William Ewart Gladstone | Lord Salisbury | Lord Rosebery
Marquess of Salisbury | Arthur Balfour | Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman | Herbert Henry Asquith | David Lloyd George | Andrew Bonar Law | Stanley Baldwin | Ramsay MacDonald | Stanley Baldwin | Ramsay MacDonald | Stanley Baldwin | Neville Chamberlain | Winston Churchill

Britain's control over its Empire loosened during the interwar period. Nationalism became stronger in other parts of the empire, particularly in India and in Egypt. 

Between 1867 and 1910, the UK granted Australia, Canada, and New Zealand "Dominion" status (near complete autonomy within the Empire). 

The end of the Second World War saw a landslide General Election victory for Clement Attlee and the Labour Party. 

As the country headed into the 1950s, rebuilding continued and a number of immigrants from the remaining British Empire were invited to help the rebuilding effort. During the 1950s the UK lost its place as a superpower and could no longer maintain its large Empire. This led to decolonization, and a withdrawal from almost all of its colonies by 1970. 

Though the 1970s and 1980s saw the UK's integration to the "European Economic Community" which became the European Union in 1992 and a strict modernization of its economy.

After the difficult 70s and 80s the 1990s saw the beginning of a period of continuous economic growth that has to date lasted over 15 years. The Good Friday Agreement saw what many believe to be the beginning of the end of conflict in Northern Ireland; since this event, there has been very little armed violence over the issue.

In the 2001 General Election, the Labour Party won a second successive victory.

Despite huge anti-war marches being held in London and Glasgow, Tony Blair gave strong support to the United State's invasion of Iraq in 2003. Forty-six thousand British troops, one-third of the total strength of the British Army (land forces), were active to assist with the invasion of Iraq and after that British armed forces were responsible for security in southern Iraq in the time before the Iraqi elections of January 2005. 

2007 sees the conclusion of the premiership of Tony Blair, followed by the premiership of Gordon Brown (from 27 June 2007).


¹ The term "United Kingdom" was first used in the 1707 Act of Union. However it is generally seen as a descriptive term, indicating that the kingdoms were freely united rather than through conquest. It is not seen as being actual "name" of the new United Kingdom, which was the "Kingdom of Great Britain". The "United Kingdom" as a name is taken to refer to the kingdom that emerged when the Kingdom of Great Britain and Kingdom of Ireland merged on 1 January 1801.

² The name "Great Britain" (then spelt "Great Brittaine") was first used by James VI/I in October 1604, who indicated that henceforth he and his successors would be viewed as Kings of Great Britain, not Kings of England and Scotland. However the name was not applied to the "state" as a unit; both England and Scotland continued to be governed independently. Its validity as a name of the Crown is also questioned, given that monarchs continued using separate ordinals (e.g., James VI/I, James VII/II) in England and Scotland. To avoid confusion, historians generally avoid using the term "King of Great Britain" until 1707 and instead to match the ordinal usage call the monarchs kings or queens of England and Scotland. Separate ordinals were abandoned when the two states merged with the Act of Union 1707, with subsequent monarchs using ordinals apparently based on English not Scottish history (it might be argued that the monarchs have simply taken the higher ordinal, which to date has always been English). One example is Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, who is referred to as being "the Second" even though there never was an Elizabeth I of Scotland or Great Britain. Thus the term "Great Britain" is generally used from 1707.

³ The number changed several times between 1801 and 1922.

Acts of Union 1707

The Acts of Union were a pair of Parliamentary Acts passed in 1706 and 1707 by, respectively, the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland, to make effective the Treaty of Union which had been negotiated between the two countries. The Acts joined the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland which had been separate states before, with separate legislatures but with the same monarch into a single Kingdom of Great Britain.

The two countries had shared a monarch for about 100 years (since the "Union of the Crowns" in 1603, when James VI of Scotland inherited the English throne from his cousin, Queen Elizabeth I).
The Acts took effect on 1 May 1707.

<doc id="101129" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=101129" title="Les Cayes">
Les Cayes

Les Cayes (Kréyòl: "Okay"; ) is a town in southwest Haiti near the river "Ravine du Sud", on the Caribbean coast. It is the capital of the Sud "Département".

Les Cayes is at about 196 km southwest of the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince. It is also the chief town of an "arrondissement" (a part of a department) with the same name. The "arrondissement" has six "communes" (a "commune" is like a municipality): Les Cayes, Camp-Perrin, Chantal, Île à Vache, Maniche and Torbeck.

The town had the name of "Aux Cayes" ("On the cays") because the small "Île à Vache" island and other cays (Grande Caye and Petite Caye) are near the town. Now the name is just "Les Cayes"; Kréyòl still keeps the old name.

In 1504, Diego Velázquez founded the town of "Salvatierra de la Sabana" (or Salvatierra de la Zabana) where is now Les Cayes. From here, he left for Cuba to take control of that island on 7 November 1511.

But people left completely the town in 1540 and the French Monsier de la Lance founded the modern town of Les Cayes in 1726. The town was destroyed by two hurricanes in 1781 and 1788.

On 24 December 1818, Simón Bolívar came to Les Cayes looking for help to fight against the Spanish government in South America. Bolívar left Haiti on 10 April 1816 for Venezuela, but came back in September of that year to this Haitian town when he lost some battles in South America. He went back to South America in December of the same year.

Les Cayes is one of the most important port of Haiti, where coffee, sugar, bananas and timber are sent to other countries and other parts of Haiti. There is also an airport, Antoine Simon Airport, with the name of a president of Haiti that was born in Les Cayes.

Spitz (dog)

Spitz-type breeds of dog have long thick fur that is often white, and pointed ears and noses. Many times, the tail is over the dog's back.

No one knows where Spitz-type dogs came from, though most seen today live in the Arctic. There is no archaeological signs showing stages between the wolf and Spitz-type dogs, but Spitz-like skeletons have been found up to 5,000 years old.

Though it is not certain for how long wolves have bred with Spitz-type dogs, it is known that humans have bred Spitz types with wolves in more recent times to get wolf-like breeds such as the Alaskan Malamute.

About 3000 years ago, dogs began to migrate from the Arctic into temperate Europe, North America, Asia, and sometimes Africa. Skeletons from around 2,000 years ago in Switzerland show that Spitz-type dogs have lived in central Europe for thousands of years. These dogs are the ancestors of the European Spitz-types, such as the German Spitz and Schipperke. Many Spitz-types also migrated into Korea and China. Later, many of these dogs were moved by humans to Japan, most likely from Korea. These Asian Spitz types are the ancestors of today's breeds such as the Chow Chow and the Akita Inu.

Through special breeding, Spitz types have evolved to help humans in three ways: hunting, herding, and pulling sleds. Smaller breeds such as the Finnish Spitz and the Lundehund were used in Scandinavia to hunt birds and smaller mammals. Larger breeds such as the Karelian Bear Dog and the Norwegian Elkhound were used for hunting large animals like moose and elk. The largest of all the Spitz types, notably the Canadian Eskimo Dog and the Greenland Dog, were used to pull sleds up until the 19th century. 

Spitz types are good at living in cold northern climates. They often have a warm, water-proof layer of fur that is thicker than the outer layer of fur. Small ears help reduce the risk of frostbite, and thick fur that grows on the paws protects the dogs from sharp ice.

Many Spitz-type breeds are wolf-like in their independence and aggression towards new humans and animals, and can require much training before they become friendly. Some, like the Karelian Bear Dog, are impossible to train as companion dogs.

The cuteness of the Spitz-type have caused people to create companion dog breeds from them. The very small Pomeranian was at first a much larger dog similar to a Keeshond before being bred to make a small court animal. The Keeshond, is a friendly and loyal, though very lively, pet. Other companion Spitz-type dog breeds is the American Eskimo Dog.

Articles of Confederation

The Articles of Confederation were the first written plan of government for the United States of America. This lasted from 1776 to 1781. A confederation is a group of states who cooperate for a common purpose. 

Even though the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution were established by many of the same people, the two documents were very different. The original five-paged Articles contained thirteen articles, a conclusion, and a signatory section. The following list contains short summaries of each of the thirteen articles.

History of the United States

The history of the United States is what happened in the past in the United States, a country in North America. Native Americans have lived there for thousands of years, long before Europeans went there. In 1492, Christopher Columbus went to America. In 1607, English people went to Jamestown, Virginia. This was the first successful town in the United States. The American colonies were settled mostly by England, who had thirteen colonies in what would become the United States. People from France, Spain, and the Netherlands also settled in America. While the English colonies were growing, many Native Americans died of disease or lost their lands. 

By 1733, there were 13 colonies. They were the first states. In 1775, at Lexington and Concord, a war between the colonies and England called the Revolutionary War started. This war started because the American colonists believed that they were not being treated equally to the Englishmen living in England. On July 4, 1776, people from 13 colonies created the United States Declaration of Independence. This said that they were free from England. George Washington helped lead the Americans during the Revolutionary War, which the Americans won. 

After the Revolution, the United States set about becoming a new nation. The leaders of the states created a constitution in 1787 and a Bill of Rights in 1791. These were based on the idea of "social contracts" by John Locke and others. In the early 1800s, the new nation faced many controversial issues, such as slavery. During the 1800s, the United States gained much more land in the West and began to become industrialized. In 1861, several states in the South left the United States to start a new country called the Confederate States of America. From 1861 to 1865, the North and South fought a war called the American Civil War over states' rights, slavery and the type of country the United States would become.

After the North won the war, all of the states that had left joined the United States again. The country went through reconstruction, which meant putting the country back together. In the late 1800s, many people came to the United States from Europe and worked in large factories. This period also led to the rise of rich businessmen, which is why it is called the Gilded Age. In the early 20th century, the United States became a world power. It was also one of the largest economies in the world. The United States fought in World War I and World War II. Between the wars, there was a period of "boom and bust", or a period of good times followed by a period of bad times. The boom period was known as the Roaring Twenties. The bust period was known as the Great Depression. The Great Depression ended with World War II.

After World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union entered a time known as the Cold War. During the Cold War, the United States government spent a lot of money on defense. It fought in Korea and Vietnam. It also put Neil Armstrong and other Americans in space. During this time, African-Americans, Chicanos, and women fought for more rights. In the 1970s and 1980s, the United States started to make fewer things in factories than they used to. The Cold War ended in 1991 when the Soviet Union fell apart. The Middle East became important in American foreign policy, especially after the September 11 attacks in 2001. 

The Pre-Columbian Era is the time before Christopher Columbus went to America in 1492. At that time, Native Americans lived on the land that is now the United States. They had different cultures: Native Americans in the Eastern United States hunted game and deer; Native Americans in the Northwest fished; Native Americans in the Southwest grew corn and built houses called pueblos; and Native Americans in the Great Plains hunted buffalo. Around the year 1000, many people think that the Vikings visited Newfoundland. However, they did not settle there.

The English tried to settle the Americas at Roanoke Island in 1585. The settlement at Roanoke Island did not last, and no one knows what happened to the people there. In 1607, the first lasting English settlement was made at Jamestown, Virginia, by John Smith, John Rolfe and other Englishmen interested in money and adventure. In its early years, many people in Virginia died of disease and starvation. The colony lasted because it made money by planting tobacco.

In 1621, a group of Englishmen called the Pilgrims settled at Plymouth, Massachusetts. A bigger colony was built at Massachusetts Bay by the Puritans in 1630. The Pilgrims and the Puritans were interested in making a better society, not looking for gold. They called this ideal society a "city on a hill". A man named Roger Williams left Massachusetts after disagreeing with the Puritans, and started the colony of Rhode Island in 1636.

England was not the only country to settle what would become the United States. In the 1500s, Spain built a fort at Saint Augustine, Florida. France settled Louisiana, and the area around the Great Lakes. The Dutch settled New York, which they called New Netherland. Other areas were settled by Scotch-Irish, Germans, and Swedes. However, in time England controlled all of the colonies, and most American colonists adopted the English way of life. The growth of the colonies was not good for Native Americans. Many of them died of smallpox, a disease brought to America by the Europeans. The ones who lived lost their lands to the colonists. 
In the early 1700s, there was a religious movement in the United States called the Great Awakening. During the Great Awakening, preachers such as Jonathan Edwards preached sermons. One of them was called "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God". The Great Awakening was one of the first events in American History that was a "mass movement", or something that many Americans were involved in. The Great Awakening, along with the Salem Witch Trials, was a reaction to what America was like around 1700 and may have led to the thinking used in the American Revolution.

By 1733, there were thirteen colonies. The colonies are often divided into three groups. The northern group was called New England and included New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. There were four Middle Colonies: New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. The South had five colonies: Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. New England had small farms and focused on fishing, forestry (trees and lumber), shipping, and small industry to make money. The South had large plantation farms that grew tobacco and later cotton. Plantations were farmed first by indentured servants (people who would work for a period of years in return for passage to America and land), and later by slaves. The Middle Colonies had medium-sized farms. These colonies also had people from many different cultures with many different beliefs. All three regions were tied to the "Atlantic economy". Atlantic merchants used ships to trade slaves, tobacco, rum, sugar, gold, spices, fish, lumber, and manufactured goods between America, the West Indies, Europe and Africa. New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Charleston were the largest cities and main ports at that time.

From 1754 to 1763, England and France fought a war over their land in America called the Seven Years' War or the French and Indian War, which the English won. After the war, they issued the Proclamation of 1763. It said that people who lived in the thirteen colonies could not live west of the Appalachian Mountains. Many colonists who wanted to move to the frontier did not like the Proclamation.

After the French and Indian War, the colonists began to think that they were not getting their "rights as freeborn Englishman". This meant they wanted to be treated fairly by the English government. Part of this was because of the Proclamation of 1763, but it was mainly caused by new taxes the British made the colonies pay to pay for the war. Americans called this "No taxation without representation", meaning that the colonists should not have to pay taxes unless they had votes in the British Parliament. These taxes included the Sugar Act (1764), Stamp Act (1765), Townsend Duties (1767), and Tea Act (1773). Each tax led to more unity between the colonies. In 1770, colonists in Boston known as the Sons of Liberty got in a fight with British soldiers. This became known as the Boston Massacre. After the Tea Act, the Sons of Liberty dumped hundreds of boxes of tea in a river. This was known as the Boston Tea Party (1773). This led to the British Army taking over Boston. After that, leaders of the 13 colonies formed a group called the Continental Congress. Many people were members of the Continental Congress, but some of the more important ones were Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, John Hancock, Roger Sherman and John Jay.

In 1776, Thomas Paine wrote a pamphlet called "Common Sense". It argued that the colonies should be free of English rule. This was based on the English ideas of natural rights and social contract put forth by John Locke and others. On July 4, 1776, people from 13 colonies agreed to the United States Declaration of Independence. This said that they were free and independent states, and were not part of England any more. The colonists were already fighting Britain in the Revolutionary War at this time. The Revolutionary War started in 1775 at Lexington and Concord. Though American soldiers under George Washington lost many battles to the British, they won a major victory at Saratoga in 1777. This led to France and Spain joining the war on the side of the Americans. In 1781, an American victory at Yorktown helped by the French led Britain to decide to stop fighting and give up the colonies. America had won the war and its independence.

In 1781, the colonies formed a confederation of states under the Articles of Confederation, but it only lasted six years. It gave almost all the power to the states and very little to the central government. The confederation had no president. It could not remove Native Americans or the British from the frontier, nor could it stop mob uprisings such as Shays' Rebellion. After Shays' Rebellion, many people thought the Articles of Confederation were not working.
In 1787, a constitution was written. Many of the people who helped write the Constitution, such as Washington, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and Gouverneur Morris, were among the major thinkers in America at the time. Some of these men would later hold important offices in the new government. The constitution created a stronger national government that had three branches: executive (the President and his staff), legislative (the House of Representatives and the Senate), and judicial (the federal courts).

Some states agreed to the Constitution very quickly. In other states, many people did not like the Constitution because it gave more power to the central government and had no bill of rights. To try and get the Constitution passed, Madison, Hamilton and Jay wrote a series of newspaper articles called the "Federalist Papers". Very soon after, the Bill of Rights was added. This was a set of 10 amendments (changes), that limited the government's power and guaranteed rights to the citizens. Like the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution is a social contract between the people and the government. The main idea of the Constitution is that the government is a representative democracy elected by the people, who all have the same rights. However, this was not true at first, when only white males who owned property could vote. Because of state laws as well as the 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th and 26th Amendments, almost all American citizens who are at least 18 years old can vote today.

In 1789, Washington was elected the first President. He defined how a person should act as President and retired after two terms. During Washington's term, there was a Whiskey Rebellion, where country farmers tried to stop the government from collecting taxes on whiskey. In 1795, Congress passed the Jay Treaty, which allowed for increased trade with Britain in exchange for the British giving up their forts on the Great Lakes. However, Great Britain was still doing things that hurt the U.S., such as impressment (making American sailors join the British Royal Navy).

John Adams defeated Thomas Jefferson in the election of 1796 to become the second President of the United States. This was the first American election that was between two political parties. As president, Adams made the army and navy larger. He also got laws passed to stop people and newspapers from saying bad things about him. These were called the Alien and Sedition Acts.

In the election of 1800, Jefferson defeated Adams. One of the most important things he did as President was to make the Louisiana Purchase from France, which made the United States twice as big. Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark to map the Louisiana Purchase. Jefferson also tried to stop trade with England and France so that the United States would not become involved in a war the two countries were fighting. Fighting broke out between the United States and England in 1812 when James Madison was President. This was called the War of 1812.

One of the problems of this period was slavery. By 1861, over three million African-Americans were slaves in the South. This means that they worked for other people, but had no freedom and received no money for their work. Most worked picking cotton on large plantations. Only a few white people in the South owned plantations. Most white people in the South owned no slaves at all. Cotton became the main crop in the South after Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin in 1793. There were a few slave rebellions against slavery, including one led by Nat Turner. All of these rebellions failed. The South wanted to keep slavery, but by the time of the Civil War, many people in the North wanted to end it. Another argument between the North and South was about the role of government. The South wanted stronger state governments, but the North wanted a stronger central government.
After the War of 1812, America had an "Era of Good Feelings" under Presidents James Madison and James Monroe. Under Monroe, the United States' policy in North America was the Monroe Doctrine, which suggested that Europe should stop trying to control the United States and other independent countries in the Americas. Around this time, Congress called for something called the "American System". The American System meant spending money on banking, transportation and communication. Due to the American System, bigger cities and more factories were built. One of the big transportation projects of this time was the Erie Canal, a canal (fake river) in the state of New York. By the 1840s, railroads were built as well as canals. By 1860, thousands of miles of railroads and telegraph lines had been built in the United States, mostly in the Northeast and Midwest.

In the early 19th century, there was an industrial revolution. Many factories were built in Northeastern cities such as Lowell, Massachusetts. Most of them made clothes. Many factory workers were women, and some were children or people from Ireland or Germany. Despite this industrialization, America was still a nation of farmers.

In the early and mid-1800s, there was a religious movement called the Second Great Awakening. It started in upstate New York, but spread to New England and the Midwest. During the Second Great Awakening, thousands of people gathered at large religious meetings called revivals. The people of the Second Great Awakening thought they could bring about a Golden Age in America through religion. The Second Great Awakening led to new religious movements such as the Holiness Movement and the Mormons, and helped groups like the Methodist Church grow. The Second Great Awakening led to two movements in reform, that is, changing laws and behaviors to make society better. One of these was the Temperance Movement, which believed that drinking alcohol was not good for society. The other was abolitionism, which tried to end slavery. People such as Harriet Beecher Stowe and William Lloyd Garrison wrote books and newspapers saying that slavery should stop. They also formed political movements, which included the Liberty Party, the Free Soil Party and the Republican Party. Some abolitionists, such as Frederick Douglass, were former slaves. By 1820, slavery was very rare in the North, but continued in the South.

In the 19th century, there was something called the “cult of domesticity” for many American women. This meant that most married women were expected to stay in the home and raise children. In a marriage, an American woman was very much under the control of her husband, and had almost no rights. Women who were not married had only a few jobs open to them, such as working in clothing factories and serving as maids. By the 19th century, women such as Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton thought that women should have more rights. In 1848, many of these women met and agreed to fight for more rights for women, including voting. Many of the women involved in the movement for women’s rights were also involved in the movement to end slavery.

In 1828, Andrew Jackson was elected President. He was the first president elected from the Democratic Party. He changed the government in many ways. Since many of his supporters were poor people who had not voted before, he rewarded them with government jobs, which is called "spoils" or "patronage". Because of Jackson, a new party was formed to run against him called the Whigs. This was called the “Second Party System”. Jackson was very much against the National Bank. He saw it as a symbol of Whigs and of powerful American businessmen. Jackson also called for a high import tax that the South did not like. They called it the "Tariff of Abominations". Jackson’s Vice-President, John C. Calhoun, was from the South. He wrote that the South should stop the tariff and perhaps leave the Union (secession). These words would be used again during the Civil War.

People started to move west of the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains at this time. The first people who moved west were people who caught and sold animal skins such as John Colter and Jim Bridger. By the 1840s, many people were moving to Oregon by wagon, and even more people went west after the California Gold Rush of 1849. Many new states were added to the first thirteen, mostly in the Midwest and South before the Civil War and in the West after the Civil War. During this period, Native Americans lost much of their land. They had lost military battles to the Americans at Tippecanoe and in the Seminole War. In the 1830s, Indians were being pushed out of the Midwest and South by events such as the Trail of Tears and the Black Hawk War. By the 1840s, most Native Americans had been moved west of the Mississippi River. 

In 1845, Texas, which was a nation after it left Mexico, joined the United States. Mexico did not like this, and the Americans wanted land Mexico had on the West Coast (“Manifest Destiny”). This led to the U.S. and Mexico fighting a war called the Mexican-American War. During the war, the U.S captured the cities of San Francisco, Los Angeles, Monterrey, Veracruz and Mexico City. As a result of the war, the U.S. gained land in California and much of the American Southwest. Many people in the North did not like this war, because they thought it was just good for Southern slave states.

In the 1840s and 1850s, people in the Northern states and people in the Southern states did not like each other very much, mostly due to the issues of slavery in the territories (parts of the United States that were not yet states) and the power of the federal government. People in the government tried to make deals to stop a war. Some deals were the Compromise of 1850 and the Kansas-Nebraska Act, but they did not really work to keep the Union together. People in the South were angry at books like "Uncle Tom’s Cabin" that said that slavery was wrong. People in the North did not like a Supreme Court decision called Dred Scott that kept Scott a slave. People from the South and people from the North started killing each other in Kansas over slavery. This was called "Bleeding Kansas". One of the people from Bleeding Kansas, John Brown, took over a town in Virginia in 1859 to make a point about slavery being wrong and to try to get slaves to fight their owners.

In the election of 1860, the Democratic Party split and the Republican candidate for President, Abraham Lincoln, was elected. After this, many Southern states quit the Union. Eventually, eleven states quit. They started a new country called the Confederate States of America, or the "Confederacy". A war broke out between the Union (North) and the Confederacy (South). The South had better generals than the North, but it had fewer railroads and almost no weapons factories. Not having factories made it harder for Southern soldiers to get guns or uniforms. The South could not get supplies because Northern ships blockaded the Southern coast.

Early in the war, Confederate generals such as Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson won battles over Union generals such as George B. McClellan and Ambrose Burnside who were not as good. In 1862 and 1863, the Union Army tried to take the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia several times, but failed each time. Lee's army invaded the North twice, but was turned back at Antietam and Gettysburg.In the middle of war, Lincoln made the Emancipation Proclamation, which supposedly freed all slaves in the Confederacy, and started letting black men fight in the Union Army. The war started going the Union’s way after the battles of Gettysburg and Vicksburg in 1863. Gettysburg stopped Lee from invading the North, and Vicksburg gave the Union control over the Mississippi River. In 1864, a Union Army under William T. Sherman marched through Georgia and destroyed much of it. By 1865, Union General Ulysses S. Grant had taken Richmond and forced Lee to give up the fight at Appomattox.

In April 1865, Lincoln was shot and killed while watching a play. The new president, Andrew Johnson, had to go through the process of Reconstruction, which was putting the United States back together after the Civil War. During this time, the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution were passed, freeing slaves, making them citizens and allowing them to vote. Congress was run by "Radical Republicans", who wanted to punish the South after the Civil War. They did not like Johnson, and almost removed him from office. They also sent many soldiers to the South, installed unpopular "scalawag" governments, and made the South pass the 14th and 15th Amendments. The South did not like this, so they made "Jim Crow" laws that placed blacks in lower roles and forced them to work as poor farmers called sharecroppers. White Southerners started a group called the Ku Klux Klan that attacked blacks and stopped them from voting.
During this time, many people moved to the United States from other countries, such as Ireland, Italy, Germany, Eastern Europe, and China. Many of them worked in large factories and lived in big cities, such as New York City, Chicago, and Boston, often in small, poor, close-together apartments called "tenements" or "slums". They often were used by "political machines", who gave them jobs and money in exchange for votes.

"Political machines" had control of the government in the last decades of the nineteenth century. Most of the Presidents were chosen by political machines and were corrupt. The government could do little, because the Presidents did not have control of Congress. Leaders of big businesses often had more power than the government. At this time, there were several very big businesses called trusts. People who ran trusts made millions of dollars while paying workers in their factories low wages. Some of these people were John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and J.P. Morgan.

After the Civil War, people continued to move west where new states were formed. People now could get free land in the West due to an 1862 law called the Homestead Act. Most of the land in the West was owned by the government, railroads, or large farmers. Railroads called the Transcontinental Railroad, finished in 1869, helped get people and goods from the west to the rest of the country. Chicago became the center of trade between West and East. This was because most of the rail lines met there. There were problems between the white settlers and the native Indians as more people began to move west. Because of this, many more Indians were killed at battles such as Wounded Knee. Almost all the Indians' land was taken away by laws like the Dawes Act.

Many Americans did not like the railroad because it charged farmers so much money that it made them poor. Workers led several strikes against the railroad that were put down by the army. Also, farmers started groups to fight the railroad, such as the Grange. These groups became the Populist Movement, which almost won the presidency under William Jennings Bryan. The Populists wanted reforms such as an income tax and direct election of Senators. The Populist Party died out after 1896. Many of the things the Populists wanted would happen during the Progressive Era.

In the United States, progressivism is the belief that the government should have a larger role in the economy to provide good living standards for people, especially workers. Imperialism was the belief that the U.S. should build a stronger navy and conquer land.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the U.S. started being more active in foreign affairs. In 1898, the United States fought a war with Spain called the Spanish-American War. The United States won, and gained Puerto Rico, Guam, Guantanamo and the Philippines. Combined with the purchase of Alaska and the taking-over of Hawaii, the United States had gained all the territory it has today, plus some it would later lose after World War II. Around this time, the U.S. and European nations opened up trade with China. This was because they had beaten China in the Opium Wars and the Boxer Rebellion. The U.S. and Europe were able to trade with China through the Open Door Policy. 

In 1901, Theodore Roosevelt became President. He had been a soldier in the Spanish-American War. He called for a foreign policy known as the “Big Stick”. This meant having a large navy and exercising control over Latin America. Between 1901 and 1930, the United States sent soldiers into Latin America several times. When Roosevelt was president, work was begun on the Panama Canal, a link between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans that made travel around the world much faster. 

During this time, people started to notice the poor condition of American cities. A group of people called the “muckrakers” wrote books and newspaper articles about subjects like the power of big business, unclean practices in factories, and the condition of poor people. Roosevelt and Congress answered their concerns with laws such as the Pure Food and Drug Act. The Act controlled the way food was made to make sure it was safe. Another response to the muckrakers was something called “trust-busting”, where big businesses were broken up into smaller ones. The biggest business broken up this way was the Standard Oil Company in 1911.

In 1912, Woodrow Wilson became President. He was a Progressive, but not quite the same as Roosevelt. He fought the “triple wall of privilege”, which was big business, taxes, and fees on goods coming into the United States. During this time, the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution were passed. They allowed for a federal income tax and direct election of U.S. Senators.

The United States did not want to enter World War I. It eventually entered the war in 1917 for two reasons. One was that a ship carrying Americans called the "Lusitania" was blown up by the Germans. The other was the Zimmerman Telegram, a message Germany sent to Mexico about invading the U.S. The United States fought on the side of Britain and France, and the war ended a year later. Wilson worked to create an international organization called the League of Nations. The main goal of the League was preventing war. However, the United States did not join because isolationists rejected the peace treaty. At the end of World War I, a flu pandemic killed millions of people in the U.S. and Europe. After the war, the United States was one of the richest and most powerful nations in the world.

There was a lot of racism in the 1920s. The Ku Klux Klan was powerful once again, and attacked blacks, Catholics, Jews and immigrants. People blamed the war and problems in the business sector on immigrants and labor leaders, whom they said were Bolsheviks (Russian communists). Many people also thought that the United States had lost touch with religion. They dealt with that by changing religion, but also by attacking science.

The 1920s were an era of boom and prosperity for the United States. Many Americans began buying consumer products, such as Model T Fords and appliances. Advertising became very important to American life. During this time, many African-Americans moved out of the South and into large cities such as New York City, Chicago, St. Louis and Los Angeles. They brought with them jazz music, which is why the 1920s are called the "Jazz Age". The 1920s were also the Prohibition Era. This was because middle-class, religious rural people who supported temperance and prohibition got the Eighteenth Amendment passed. During the 1920s, drinking alcohol was supposedly illegal, but many Americans drank it anyway. This led to much organized crime involving selling illegal alcohol. 

After World War I, the United States had an isolationist foreign policy. That meant it did not want to enter into another global war. It passed laws and treaties that supposedly would end war forever, and refused to sell weapons to its former allies. 

In 1921, Warren G. Harding became President. He believed that the best way to make the economy good was for the government to be friendly to big business by cutting taxes and regulating less. While the economy was doing very well under these policies, the gap between how much money the rich had and how much money the poor had was as big as it had ever been. Harding's presidency had several problems. The biggest one was Teapot Dome. The Teapot Dome scandal involved one of Harding's advisors taking a lot of money in exchange for allowing oil drilling in the Navy Oil Reserve. Harding died in 1923, and Calvin Coolidge became President. Coolidge believed that the government should keep out of business, just like Harding, and continued many of Harding's policies. Coolidge chose not to run again in 1928 and Herbert Hoover became president.

In 1929, a Great Depression hit the United States. The stock market crashed (lost much of its value). Many banks ran out of money and closed. By 1932, over a quarter of the nation had no jobs, and much of the nation was poor or unemployed. Many people were driven off farms, not only because of the Depression, but also because of a storm known as the "Dust Bowl" and because farmers had not been doing well during the 1920s.

President Hoover tried to do something about the Depression, but it did not work. In 1932, he was defeated and Franklin D. Roosevelt became President. He created the New Deal. It was a series of government programs which would give relief (to the people who were hurt by the bad economy), recovery (to make the economy better), and reform (to make sure a depression never happens again). 

The New Deal had many programs such as Social Security, the National Recovery Administration (regulated wages), Works Progress Administration (built thousands of roads, schools, government buildings and works of art), the Civilian Conservation Corps (gave young people jobs to help the environment), and Tennessee Valley Authority (built dams and electric lines in the South). These programs put millions of Americans to work, though often at low pay. Many of these programs were started early in Roosevelt's term in a time called the "Hundred Days" or in 1935 in a time called the "Second New Deal". Programs like Social Security grew out of populist movements by people such as Huey Long that were called "Share Our Wealth" and "Ham and Eggs". The New Deal also led to the rise of worker's unions such as the Congress of Industrial Organizations.

The New Deal is often called the period that "saved capitalism", and stopped America from becoming a Communist or Fascist state. Although the New Deal improved the economy, it did not end the Great Depression. The Great Depression was ended by World War II.

As World War II was beginning, the United States said they would not get involved in it. Most Americans thought the United States should remain neutral, and some people thought the United States should enter the war on the side of the Germans. Eventually, the U.S. did try to help the Allied Powers (Soviet Union, Britain, and France) with the Lend Lease Act. It gave the Allies a lot of money and guns in trade for use of air bases throughout the world.

On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, a U.S. base in Hawaii. The U.S. was no longer neutral, and it declared war on the Axis Powers (Germany, Japan, Italy). The U.S. entering World War II ended the Great Depression because the war created many jobs. While some of the battles the U.S. fought in were air and naval battles with Japan, the U.S. mainly fought in Europe and Africa. The U.S. opened up several fronts, including in North Africa and Italy. The U.S. also bombed Germany from airplanes, blowing up German cities and factories. On June 6, 1944 (D-Day), American and British forces invaded Normandy. A year later, the Allies had freed France and taken Berlin. In 1945, Roosevelt died, and Harry Truman became president. The U.S. decided to drop two atomic bombs on Japan. Japan gave up soon afterwards, and the war ended. However, the atomic bombs killed many ordinary people in the cities, not only soldiers. At least 250,000 Japanese people died in four days. 

The war meant different things for women and minorities. During the war, many women worked in weapons factories. They were symbolized by a character called "Rosie the Riveter". Many African-Americans served in the army, but often in segregated units with white officers. Japanese-Americans on the West Coast were forced to live in internment camps, though a few also served in the Army.

After World War II, the Soviet Union and the United States were the two most powerful countries left in the world. The Cold War was a period of tension between the two countries over ways of life. The two countries tried to get other countries on their side. The Soviet Union tried to get countries to become Communist and the United States tried to stop them from being Communist. American and Soviet soldiers never fought in battles, but they fought indirectly in the Korean War (1950s) and the Vietnam War (1950s–1970s). 

The Korean War lasted only a few years, but led to American soldiers being in Korea since then. The Vietnam War lasted much longer. It started with a few American troops in Vietnam, but by the 1960s thousands of Americans were being sent to Vietnam. Both wars were between a Northern Communist government helped by the Soviet Union and Communist China and a Southern government helped by the U.S. The Korean War resulted in a split Korea, but the Vietnam War resulted in a Communist Vietnam after the United States left due to American people wanting to end the war. Over a quarter million Americans died or were wounded in Vietnam, which was very much a military failure. The U.S. and Soviet Union argued about where they could place nuclear weapons. One of these arguments was the Cuban Missile Crisis. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, the U.S. and Soviet Union came very close to attacking each other with nuclear weapons. 

During the Cold War, the United States had a "Red Scare" where the government tried to find people it thought were Communist. The House of Representatives had a group called the House Un-American Activities Committee to deal with this, and Joseph McCarthy led hearings in the Senate. The Red Scare led to people losing their jobs, going to jail, and even being executed. Many actors and authors were put on blacklists, which meant they could not get jobs in movies or get credit for their writings.

The Cold War began with an arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union to see who could have more and better weapons. This started after the Soviets were the second country to develop an atomic bomb. In the United States, this started something called the "Military Industrial Complex", which meant business and government working together to spend a lot of money on large-scale weapons projects. Business and government helped each other to get more money and more power. Part of the Complex was something called the Marshall Plan, which rebuilt Europe while making them buy American goods. The Complex allowed for a growing middle class, but also kept the Cold War going.
Besides the arms race, another part of the Cold War was the "Space Race". This started when the Soviets launched a satellite into space called "Sputnik" in 1957. Americans became worried that the United States was falling behind the Soviet Union, and made their schools focus more on math and science. Within a few years, both the United States and the Soviet Union had sent satellites, animals and people into orbit. In 1969 the "Apollo 11" mission put Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Moon.

United States foreign policy changed in the 1970s when the United States left Vietnam and Richard Nixon left office due to Watergate. In the 1970s and 1980s, the United States had a policy of "detente" with the Soviet Union. This meant that the two countries signed treaties to stop use of weapons. Under Nixon and Ronald Reagan, the United States sent troops and money to many Latin American governments to stop them from being Communist. This led to violence in Latin America. Around this time, the economy suffered because the United States was not making as many things as it used to, and because some countries in the Middle East were not giving the U.S. as much oil as it wanted (this was called an "oil embargo"). The Middle East became very important in American foreign policy after several Americans were kidnapped in Iran in 1979. In the 1980s, people in the U.S. government sold weapons to people in Iran and gave the money to "contra" soldiers in Nicaragua. This was called "Iran-Contra". In the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. normalized relations with China. The Cold War came to an end as Communist governments in the Soviet Union and other countries fell apart.

The United States once again had prosperity. Millions of white people moved out of the cities and into suburbs, and into Southern and Western states known as the "Sunbelt". They bought new cars and television sets. The birth rate in the 1940s and 1950s rose, leading to a population growth known as the "Baby Boom" People's thoughts about the future led into "Space Age" or "Googie" style art and architecture. Many more people became part of the middle class, but there were still many people who were poor.

One of the groups that were often poor were African-Americans. Most either lived in poor neighborhoods in Northern cities, or in the South where they faced racism and "Jim Crow" segregation. These conditions led to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s, led by Martin Luther King Jr. and others. In 1954, the Supreme Court found school segregation illegal in "Brown v. Board of Education", though it would be several years before school segregation was ended. In 1955, King led a bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama. In the late 1950s and 1960s, he wanted action to stop segregation in businesses and public places. King got help from Presidents John F. Kennedy, who was shot, and Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1963, he led a march on Washington calling for civil rights. Soon after, Congress passed laws that made most segregation illegal. Johnson also had a program called the Great Society that helped poor and minorities.

Blacks were not the only group pushing for rights in the Cold War era. Gays and lesbians, who had often been persecuted, started to ask for rights, beginning with the Stonewall riots in 1969. Chicanos also fought for rights, as did women. Though women had had jobs during World War II, most of them went back to the home after the war. Women did not like that they often held jobs that paid less than men or that fewer opportunities were open to them. People like Betty Freidan and Gloria Steinem founded groups such as the National Organization for Women to try and solve these problems. NOW and other groups wanted an Equal Rights Amendment that would guarantee them equality in all areas. In the 1970s and 1980s, many more jobs and opportunities were opened to women. There were some women like Phyllis Schlafly who opposed Freidan and Steinem and were known as "anti-feminists". It was partly because of the anti-feminists that the Equal Rights Amendment was defeated, but also because women had already gained equality in many areas and they did not want to be drafted into the army.

In the 1960s, the counterculture was created. Some of the followers of the counterculture were called hippies. They had long hair and acted very liberally, living communally, smoking marijuana and practicing free love. The counterculture, along with college students, were the groups most against the Vietnam War. They also were the groups that listened to new music known as rock and roll.

In 1973, the Supreme Court issued a decision called "Roe v. Wade", which made many abortions legal. This, along with the counterculture and the push for rights of minorities and gays, led to a reaction by Jerry Falwell and other conservatives who called themselves the "Religious Right" and the "Moral Majority". After Watergate, these forces combined with people who did not like big government to create a new Republican Party who got Ronald Reagan elected President in 1980. Reagan said that "Government is not a solution to our problem, government "is" the problem".

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Cold War came to an end. This was due to the Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev starting a policy called perestroika, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the Soviet Union breaking into different countries. Around this time, the United States became a "post-industrial society". That means it did not make as many things as it used to, and had many people working in service jobs. Part of these service jobs were in computers and the Internet, which came into wide use in the 1990s. By this time, the United States had a very large trade deficit, meaning it received more goods from other countries, such as China, than it sent to other countries. The Middle East became the main focus of U.S. foreign policy, because the United States got billions of barrels of oil from there. Many countries in the Middle East did not care for the U.S., because it is an ally of Israel. In 1991, the United States fought a war with Iraq called the First Gulf War or Operation Desert Storm. This was due to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein ordering an attack on Kuwait, a small country that the United States got oil from.

In 1992, Bill Clinton became President. Under Clinton, the United States sent soldiers into Bosnia as part of a United Nations mission. The United States also agreed to a trade pact called the North American Free Trade Agreement, and dropped some of its rules on banking. Many people did not like some of the things Clinton did, and he lost control of Congress to the Republicans in 1994. Clinton was impeached for lying in court about sexual activity with a secretary named Monica Lewinsky, but the Senate voted against removing him as President.

In 2000, George W. Bush was elected President, even though Al Gore got more votes. Soon into Bush's term, terrorists attacked the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. They took control of four airplanes and crashed two of them into the World Trade Center and one into the Pentagon. Thousands of people died when the buildings burned and fell down. Bush became much more popular with the American people after the attacks. Soon after the attacks, the government passed a new law called the USA PATRIOT Act. The PATRIOT Act allowed government agencies to collect information about Americans who were thought to be terrorists. Many people thought this law was bad for Americans' rights. Soon after the attacks, the U.S. and NATO went to Afghanistan to find Osama bin Laden and others who they believed planned the September 11 attacks. In 2003, the United States invaded Iraq because some people thought Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Millions of people from around the world did not like the War in Iraq. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have lasted many years and have been called a "Long War" or a new American Empire. By 2011, most American soldiers had left Iraq, and combat there was over.

In 2005, the southern United States was hit by a huge hurricane called Hurricane Katrina. Much of the city of New Orleans was destroyed. In 2006, the Democrats won back Congress because Americans did not like the way Bush dealt with War in Iraq or Katrina. At the end of Bush's term, the United States entered the worst recession since the Great Depression. Barack Obama was elected President in 2008. He became the first African-American President of the United States. During his first years in office, Obama and Congress passed reforms on health care and banking. They also passed a large stimulus bill to help the economy during the recession. During the recession, the government used large amounts of money to keep the banking and auto industries from falling apart. Obama not only had to deal with the recession, but also a large oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. A movement called the "Tea Party" started during Obama's presidency. This group opposes Obama's health care plan and other policies they see as "big government." Due to the recession, the Tea Party and a dislike of what Obama did, Republicans won a large number of House and Senate seats in the 2010 election. In 2011, Tea Party members of Congress almost shut down the government and sent the U.S. into default (not being able to pay people the government owes money). A few months later, many young people protested against big business. They thought big business made too much money.

The United States faces many issues at the present. One of these is what kind of government the United States should become. Liberals want a large government, while the Tea Party and other groups want a smaller government. One of these debates is over health care. Health care costs a lot more today than it did a few years ago. Conservatives and liberals also disagree on social issues such as abortion and gay marriage. There are also many trends and developments that the U.S. must deal with. One of these is immigration. Many people are coming to the U.S. from Latin America and Asia, especially Mexico. This is called the "browning of America". There is also something called the "graying of America". That refers to the Baby Boom getting older and retiring. Other issues facing the United States are a growing concern about the environment. This has led to the creation of many "green jobs," or jobs that create clean or renewable energy.

<doc id="101179" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=101179" title="Exponential function">
Exponential function

In mathematics, an exponential function is a function that quickly grows. More precisely, it is the function formula_1, where e is Euler's constant, an irrational number approximating 2.71828. Because the number e can be formulated as an infinite limit formula_2, exp(x) is thus that formula to the "x"th power, or formula_3
Because and although exponential functions use exponentiation, they follow the same rules. Thus,

The natural logarithm is the inverse operation of an exponential function.

This may also seem unintuitive because of a fundamental property in differential calculus:
This means that the slope of an exponential function is an exponential function itself, and subsequently this means it has a slope of 1 at x=0. These properties are the reason it is an important function in mathematics.
The exponential function is among the most useful of mathematical functions. It is used to represent exponential growth, which has uses in virtually all science subjects and also in Finance where it has prominence.

One example of an exponential function in real life would be interest in a bank. If a person deposits £100 into an account which gets 3% interest a month then the balance each month would be (assuming the money is untouched):
Notice how the extra money from interest increases each month. The greater the original balance, the more interest the person will get.

Two mathematical examples of exponential functions are shown below.

a=2

a=3

Even though the base (formula_9) can be any number bigger than zero, for example, 10 or 1/2, often it is a special number called e. The number "e" cannot be written exactly, but it is almost equal to 2.71828.

The number "e" is important to every exponential function. For example, a bank pays interest of 0.01 percent every day. One person takes his interest money and puts it in a box. After 10,000 days (about 30 years), he has 2 times as much money as he started with. Another person takes his interest money and puts it back into the bank. Because the bank now pays him interest on his interest, the amount of money is an exponential function. After 10,000 days, he does not have 2 times as much money as he started with, but he has 2.718145 times as much money as he started with. This number is very close to the number "e". If the bank pays interest more often, so the amount paid each time is less, then the number will be closer to the number "e".

A person can also look at the picture to see why the number "e" is important for exponential functions. The picture has three different curves. The curve with the black points is an exponential function with a base a little smaller than "e". The curve with the short black lines is an exponential function with a base a little bigger than "e". The blue curve is an exponential function with a base exactly equal to "e". The red line is a tangent to the blue curve. It touches the blue curve at one point without crossing it. A person can see that the red curve crosses the "x"-axis, the line that goes from left to right, at -1. This is true only for the blue curve. This is the reason that the exponential function with the base "e" is special.

Roger D. Kornberg

Roger David Kornberg is an American biochemist who was born on . He is a professor of Structural Biology at Stanford University School of Medicine. Kornberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2006 for studying eukaryote transcription. This is copying of information from DNA to RNA. His father, Arthur Kornberg, who was also a professor at Stanford University, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959.

Kornberg was born in St. Louis, Missouri to a Jewish family. He was the first of three children born to Arthur Kornberg and his wife, Sylvy. The parents worked together as biochemists. Roger Kornberg earned his bachelors degree from Harvard University in 1967 and his PhD from Stanford University in 1972. He then became a Fellow at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at the University of Cambridge, England.

All heredity is controlled by genes. For the cells to make use of the information in the genes, a copy of part of the gene must be made. The copying is called transcription. Transcription makes an RNA copy of part of the DNA. The RNA is moved out of the cell nucleus, to ribosomes, where it does its work. This is called messenger RNA and it gives the amino acid sequence for protein production. This second process is called translation. The RNA with the instructions for proteins is called RNA polymerase II. This process works in all eukaryotes, including all plants and animals.

Kornberg worked with Aaron Klug and Francis Crick at the MRC in the 1970s. He discovered the nucleosome, a very important protein structure in chromosomes. Nucleosomes form the basic repeating units of eukaryotic chromatin. This packs the large eukaryotic genomes into the nucleus and allows it to be controlled. 

Kornberg made the discovery that signals to the RNA are made by another protein that they called "Mediator". The Nobel Prize committee said, "the great complexity of eukaryotic organisms is enabled by the fine interplay between tissue-specific substances, enhancers in the DNA and Mediator. The discovery of Mediator is therefore a true milestone in the understanding of the transcription process".

After long effort, Kornberg was able to use X-ray crystallography to take 3D pictures of RNA molecules, lipids and proteins. With these studies, Kornberg has created a picture of how DNA works. The Nobel Prize committee said, "the truly revolutionary aspect of the picture Kornberg has created is that it captures the process of transcription in full flow. What we see is an RNA-strand being constructed, and hence the exact positions of the DNA, polymerase and RNA during this process".

In 1959, Roger Kornberg's father, Arthur Kornberg, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for studies of how genetic information moves from one DNA molecule to another. This is called DNA replication. Arthur Kornberg found the first enzyme that could make DNA. This was the first known enzyme to take its instructions from a DNA copy. Roger Kornbergs younger brother, Thomas Bill Kornberg, discovered DNA polymerases II and III in 1970 and is now a geneticist at the University of California, San Francisco. All three Kornbergs have worked to understand how genetic information is used in cells. Arthur and Roger Kornberg are the sixth father and son to win Nobel Prizes.

Professor Kornberg has received these awards:

Businessperson

A businessperson (also businessman or businesswoman) is someone who works at a job that focuses on making money. Generally, it is someone who works in the management (at any level) of a company. 

Businessperson is used more commonly than in the past, in place of the words businessman or businesswoman to avoid sexism and stereotypes. Sometimes the words businessman or businesswoman are used to point out a man or woman.

Businessmen generally wear standard business clothes: a suit with collar, shirt, and necktie. However, this changes depending on the company, the local culture, and the country. In more casual places, neckties can be left out. 

Businesswomen's clothes have gone through many changes. Dresses and suits are common today.

Tangent (geometry)

In geometry, a tangent is a straight line that touches a curve at one point. Where they touch each other, the line and the curve are both "going in the same direction". For this reason, the tangent is a good approximation to the curve near that point. They are almost the same.

History of North America

The History of North America deals with an area where humans came to live relatively recently, compared to Africa, Europe, and Asia. 

Scientists have different theories as to the origins of the early human population of the North America. The indigenous peoples of North America themselves have many creation stories, that tell that native Americans have been present on the land since its creation. A few of these scientists are Jan Kevin H. Bautista, Joseph Emmanuel A. Padilla, and Nigel O. Hufana.

Before contact with Europeans the natives of North America were divided into many different communities, from small bands of a few families to large empires. They lived in several culture areas, which roughly correspond to geographic and biological zones of North America and give a good indication of the main occupation of the people who lived there (e.g. the Bison hunters of the Great Plains, or the farmers of Mesoamerica). Native groups can also be classified by their language family. It is important to note that peoples with similar languages did not always share the same material culture, nor were they always allies.

Scientists believe that the Inuit people of the high Arctic came to North America much later than other native groups, as evidenced by the disappearance of Dorset culture artifacts from the archaeological record, and their replacement by the Thule people.

During the thousands of years of native inhabitation on the continent, cultures changed and shifted. Archaeologists often name different cultural groups they discover after the site where they are first found. One of the oldest cultures yet found is the Clovis culture of modern New Mexico. A more recent example is the group of related cultures called the Mound builders (e.g. the Fort Walton Culture), found in the Mississippi river valley. They flourished from 3000 BC to the 1500s AD.

The more southern cultural groups of North America were responsible for the domestication of many common crops now used around the world, such as tomatoes and squash. Perhaps most importantly they domesticated one of the world's major staples, maize (corn).

As a result of the development of agriculture in the south, important cultural development was possible there. For example, the Maya civilization developed a writing system, built huge pyramids, had a complex calendar, and developed the concept of zero 500 years before anyone in the Old World. The Mayan culture was still present when the Spanish arrived in Central America, but political dominance in the area had shifted to the Aztec Empire farther north.

Upon the arrival of the Europeans in the "New World", native peoples found their culture changed drastically. As such, their affiliation with political and cultural groups changed as well, several linguistic groups went extinct, and others changed quite quickly. The name and cultures that Europeans recorded for the natives were not necessarily the same as the ones they had used a few generations before, or the ones in use today.

There was limited contact between North American peoples and the outside world before 1492. Several theoretical contacts have been proposed, but the earliest physical evidence comes to us from the Norse or Vikings. Norse captain Leif Ericson is believed to have reached the Island of Newfoundland circa 1000 AD. They named their new discovery Vinland. The only Norse site yet discovered in North America is at L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland and Labrador. The Norse colonies were later abandoned.

The Viking voyages did not become common knowledge in the Old World, and Europeans remained ignorant of the existence of the Americas, until 1492. As part of a general age of discovery Italian sailor Christopher Columbus proposed a voyage west from Europe to find a shorter route to Asia. He eventually received the backing of Isabella I and Ferdinand II, Queen and King of newly united Spain. In 1492 Columbus reached land in the Bahamas. 

Almost 500 years after the Norse, John Cabot explored the east coast of what would become Canada in 1497. Giovanni da Verrazzano explored the East Coast of America from Florida to presumably Newfoundland in 1524. Jacques Cartier made a series of voyages on behalf of the French crown in 1534 and penetrated the St. Lawrence River.

Initially, European activity consisted mostly of trade and exploration. Eventually Europeans began to establish settlements. The three principal colonial powers were Spain, England, and France, although eventually even small powers like the Netherlands and Sweden received minor holdings on the continent. 

Settlement by the Spanish started the European colonization of the Americas, involving genocide of the native Indians. They gained control of most of the largest islands in the Caribbean and conquered the Aztecs, gaining control of present-day Mexico and Central America. This was the beginning of the Spanish Empire in the New World. The first successful Spanish settlement in continental North America was Veracruz in 1519, followed by many other settlements in colonial New Spain and Spanish Florida.

The first successful English settlements were at Jamestown (1607) (along with its satellite, Bermuda in 1609) and Plymouth (1620), in what are today Virginia and Massachusetts respectively. The first French settlements were Port Royal (1604) and Quebec City (1608) in what is now Nova Scotia and Quebec. The Fur Trade soon became the primary business on the continent and as a result transformed the Native Americans lifestyle.

Farther to the south, plantation slavery became the main industry of the West Indies, and this gave rise to the beginning of the Atlantic slave trade.

By 1663 the French crown had taken over control of New France from the fur-trading companies, and the English charter colonies gave way to more metropolitan control. This ushered in a new era of more formalized colonialism in North America.

Rivalry between the European powers created a series of wars on the North American landmass that would have great impact on the development of the colonies. Territory often changed hands multiple times. Peace was not achieved until French forces in North America were vanquished at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham at Quebec City, and France ceded most of her claims outside of the Caribbean.

Viceroyalty of New Spain was the name of the viceroy-ruled territories of the Spanish Empire in Asia, North America and its peripheries from 1535 to 1821.

The coming of the American Revolution had a great impact across the continent. Most importantly it directly led to the creation of the United States of America. However, the associated American Revolutionary War was an important war that touched all corners of the region. The flight of the United Empire Loyalists led to the creation of English Canada as a separate community. Meanwhile, Spain's hold on Mexico was weakening. Independence was declared in 1810 by Miguel Hidalgo, starting the "Mexican War of Independence". In 1813, José María Morelos and the Congress of Anáhuac signed the Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America, the first legal document where the separation of the New Spain with respect to Spain is proclaimed. Spain finally recognized Mexico's independence in 1821.

From the time of independence of the United States, that country expanded rapidly to the west, acquiring the massive Louisiana territory in 1803. An attempt at northern expansion was blocked by Britain during the War of 1812. At the same time, British settlement in Canada increased. 
US expansion was complicated by the division between "free" and "slave" states, which led to the Missouri Compromise 1820. Likewise, Canada faced a division between French and English communities that led to the outbreak of civil strife in 1837. Mexico faced constant political tensions between liberals and conservatives, as well as the rebellion of the English-speaking region of Tejas, which declared itself the Republic of Texas 1836. In 1845 Texas joined the United States, which would later lead to the Mexican–American War. As a result of conflict with Mexico, the United States made further territorial gains in California and the Southwest.

In Mexico, the entire era was dominated by the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz.

As a part of the British Empire Canada immediately was at war in 1914. Canada bore the brunt of several major battles during the early stages of the war including the use of poison gas attacks at Ypres. Losses became grave, and the government eventually brought in conscription, despite the fact this was against the wishes of the majority of French Canadians. In the ensuing Conscription Crisis of 1917, riots broke out on the streets of Montreal. In neighboring Newfoundland, the new dominion suffered a devastating loss on July 1, 1916, the First day on the Somme.

The United States stayed apart from the conflict until 1917, joining the Entente powers. The United States was then able to play a crucial role at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 that shaped interwar Europe.

Mexico was not part of the war as the country was embroiled in the Mexican Revolution at the time.

The 1920s brought an age of great prosperity in the United States, and to a lesser degree Canada. But the Wall Street Crash of 1929 combined with drought ushered in a period of economic hardship in the United States and Canada.

From 1936 to 1949, this was a popular uprising against the anti-Catholic Mexican government of the time, set off specifically by the anti-clerical provisions of the Mexican Constitution of 1917.

Once again Canada found herself at war before her neighbours, however even Canadian contributions were slight before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

The entry of the United States into the war helped to tip the balance in favour of the allies.

Two Mexican tankers, transporting oil to the United States, were attacked and sunk by the Germans in the Gulf of Mexico waters, in 1942. The incident happened in spite of Mexico's neutrality at that time. This led Mexico to declare war to the Axis nations and entered the conflict.

The destruction of Europe wrought by the war vaulted all North American countries to more important roles in world affairs. The United States especially emerged as a "superpower".

The early Cold War era saw the United States as the most powerful nation in a Western coalition of which Mexico and Canada were also a part. At home, the United States witnessed convulsive change especially in the area of race relations. In Canada this was mirrored by the Quiet Revolution and the emergence of Quebec nationalism.

Mexico experienced an era of huge economic growth after World War II, a heavy industrialization process and a growth of its middle class, a period known in Mexican history as the ""El Milagro Mexicano"" (Mexican miracle).

The Caribbean saw the beginnings of decolonization, while on the largest island the Cuban Revolution introduced Cold War rivalries into Latin America.

Cough

A cough, also known as tussis, is an action the body takes to get rid of anything that irritates the lungs or throat. To do this, muscles in the thoracic cavity contract to make air leave the lungs with a lot of force. Coughs often happen quickly and more than once, and are usually accompanied by a unique sound, also called a cough.

Coughs are more likely to happen when a person is sick, because infections often irritate breathing passages. Another cause of coughs is a person breathing air that is not clean.

Creation myth

A creation myth is a story that explains how the universe started, how the earth came to be and why there are humans. Creation myths are usually part of religions and mythologies. Very often, creation myths say that humans were made by a god, spirit or other supreme being. 

In the beginning, there was just water. All the animals lived above it and the sky was overcrowded. They were all curious about what was beneath the water and one day Dayuni'si, the water beetle, volunteered to explore it. He explored the surface but could not find any solid ground. He explored below the surface to the bottom and all he found was mud which he brought back to the surface. After collecting the mud, it began to grow in size and spread outwards until it became the Earth as we know it. 

In the beginning nothing existed, darkness was all around. Suddenly from the darkness camea thin disc, one side yellow and the other side white, appearing suspended in midair. Within the disc sat a small bearded man, Creator, the "One Who Lives Above". When he looked into the endless darkness, light appeared above. He looked down and it became a sea of light. To the east, he created yellow streaks of dawn. To the west, tints of many colours appeared everywhere. There were also clouds of different colors. He also created three other gods: a little girl, a sun god and a small boy. Then he created celestial phenomena, the winds, the tarantula, and the earth from the sweat of the four gods mixed together in the Creator's palms, from a small round, brown ball, not much larger than a bean. The world was expanded to its current size by the gods kicking the small brown ball. Creator told Wind to go inside the ball and to blow it up. The tarantula, who knew what to do, spun a black cord and, attaching it to the ball, crawled away fast to the east, pulling on the cord with all his strength. Tarantula repeated with a blue cord to the south, a yellow cord to the west, and a white cord to the north. With mighty pulls in each direction, the brown ball stretched to immeasurable size--it became the earth! No hills, mountains, or rivers were visible; only smooth, treeless, brown plains appeared. Then the Creator created the rest of the beings and features of the Earth.

In the Judeo-Christian-Islamic Mythology, it is believed that an entity referred to as God created the universe in six days.


Christian scientists that believe God created the earth are called "Creation scientists." They research to find proof of creation and that the universe was designed by God.

Many cultures have stories describing the origin of the world, which may be roughly grouped into common types. In one type of story, the world is born from a world egg; such stories include the Finnish epic poem "Kalevala", the Chinese story of Pangu or the Indian Brahmanda Purana. In related stories, the creation is caused by a single entity emanating or producing something by his or herself, as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept of Adi-Buddha, the ancient Greek story of Gaia (Mother Earth), the Aztec goddess Coatlicue myth, the ancient Egyptian god Atum story, or the Genesis creation myth. In another type of story, the world is created from the union of male and female deities, as in the Maori story of Rangi and Papa. In other stories, the Universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god — as from Tiamat in the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish or from the giant Ymir in Norse mythology – or from chaotic materials, as in Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology. In another type of story, the world is created by the command of a divinity, as in the ancient Egyptian story of Ptah or the Genesis creation myth as a part of Jewish and Christian mythology. In other stories, the universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as Brahman and Prakrti, or the yin and yang of the Tao.

Although Heraclitus argued for eternal change, his quasi-contemporary Parmenides made the radical suggestion that all change is an illusion, that the true underlying reality is eternally unchanging and of a single nature. Parmenides denoted this reality as το εν (The One). Parmenides' theory seemed implausible to many Greeks, but his student Zeno of Elea challenged them with several famous paradoxes. Aristotle resolved these paradoxes by developing the notion of an infinitely divisible continuum, and applying it to space and time.

The Indian philosopher Kanada, founder of the Vaisheshika school, developed a theory of atomism and proposed that light and heat were varieties of the same substance. In the 5th century AD, the Buddhist atomist philosopher Dignāga proposed atoms to be point-sized, durationless, and made of energy. They denied the existence of substantial matter and proposed that movement consisted of momentary flashes of a stream of energy.

The theory of temporal finitism was inspired by the doctrine of creation shared by the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Christian philosopher, John Philoponus, presented the philosophical arguments against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past. Philoponus' arguments against an infinite past were used by the early Muslim philosopher, Al-Kindi (Alkindus); the Jewish philosopher, Saadia Gaon (Saadia ben Joseph); and the Muslim theologian, Al-Ghazali (Algazel). They employed two logical arguments against an infinite past, the first being the "argument from the impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite", which states:

The second argument, the "argument from the impossibility of completing an actual infinite by successive addition", states:

Both arguments were adopted by later Christian philosophers and theologians, and the second argument in particular became more famous after it was adopted by Immanuel Kant in his thesis of the first antinomy concerning time.

Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (1149–1209) criticized the idea of the Earth's centrality within the universe. In the context of his commentary on the Qur'anic verse, "All praise belongs to God, Lord of the Worlds," he raises the question of whether the term "worlds" in this verse refers to "multiple worlds within this single universe or cosmos, or to many other universes or a multiverse beyond this known universe." He rejected the Aristotelian and Avicennian notions of a single universe revolving around a single world, and instead argued that there are more than "a thousand thousand worlds ("alfa alfi 'awalim") beyond this world such that each one of those worlds be bigger and more massive than this world as well as having the like of what this world has." He argued that there exists an infinite outer space beyond the known world, and that God has the power to fill the vacuum with an infinite number of universes.

Tarantula

Tarantula is the common name for a group of "hairy" and often very large spiders belonging to the family Theraphosidae, of which approximately 900 species have been found. Some tarantulas hunt prey in trees and some hunt on the ground. All tarantulas can make silk. They use silk to make shelters like tube tents in trees, to line burrows if they live on the ground, and they all use silk to wrap up prey before they eat it. It is easy to see a tarantula turning around and around in one spot with the prey in its mouth, but it is hard to see the silk coming out because it is small in diameter (thickness) and transparent. These spiders are found in warmer regions around the world. 
Tarantulas are eaten by big snakes and the Tarantula eating wasp. Defenses are camouflage and fangs.

File format

File formats are also known as file types. A computer stores data in a computer file in the shape of a file format. For example: images are stored in a different shape than music files. 

Also, most types of data (for example text, image or sound) have many varieties of file formats, all with their own special strengths and weaknesses.

There are, for example, more than five ways to store text as a file. Two of the most known ways are: the plain ".txt" format and the simplest of the "HTML" formats. The difference is that a .txt file can only store a sequence of characters but an HTML file can also store links to other files and the formatting of the text, for example whether the text is bold, underlined or italic (but usually HTML should say whether the text is very important, a link, or not very important; whether important text should be bold, italic or red is then specified using a file in a special format called CSS).

Often a file in a file which can store more information is bigger than a file in a format which can only store simple basic data. But the file in the more functional (complex, with can store more information) format can be more difficult to use with more simple programs, and a faster computer can be needed to use it.

File formats made for commercial proprietary software are sometimes a secret, so that people who do not work in the company which made the proprietary software cannot use their own and others' files in the format without buying their software. That action is called vendor lock-in, and can be used to make a monopoly. Because of that, it is sometimes a crime.

Lascaux

Lascaux is the name given to a number of caves in southwestern France famous for their cave paintings. The original caves are located near the village of Montignac, in the Dordogne "département". They contain some of the most well-known Upper Paleolithic art. These paintings are estimated to be 16,000 years old. They primarily consist of realistic images of large animals. Many of these animals are known from fossil evidence to have lived in the area at the time. Lascaux was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list in 1979.

The caves were discovered in 1940. By 1955, about 1200 people visited them every day. They were then closed and restored. Replicas of the cave paintings were made in another cave nearby. Today, the original cave is no longer accessible to the public. 

In 2000, another problem emerged: Certain kinds of fungi started to grow in the original cave. These are extremely resistant to the usual fungicides used, even to formaldehyde. The fungus lives in symbiosis with a bacterium which is capable of destroying the fungicide. Therefore, the fungicide needs to be combined with an antibiotic to kill the bacterium as well.

As of 2006, the situation is more or less under control. The original caves are now sprayed with the fungicide/antibiotic every fortnight. Special workers need to clear the cave walls by hand, removing the mycelium which grows despite the treatment.

Lunar phase

Throughout the month,the moon goes through lunar phases. A lunar phase is a "transformation" that the moon goes through. Each lunar phase can be identified by the appearance of the moon and the time of the month.

There are 8 total phases that the moon undergoes(does).
At first, the moon is invisible, because it is a new moon. This starts out the cycle. The moon, however, soons shows itself after a couple of days. The next phase is a Waxing Cresent. After that, the moon comes out of the darkness and becomes a half moon. The next step is a gibbous, which is about "3/4, or 75%", of the moon showing. The last waxing phase is the full, complete moon. When that is all done, the moon shrinks, and every phase listed is repeated again, except the moon is getting smaller as opposed to larger. Finally, it restarts the cycle again. 
These changes happen because the moon revolves, or moves, slowly around the moon. When the moon is shown as a cresent,half moon,etc., it is because the 2 different hemispheres of Earth are looking at different, illuminated parts of the moon. So, astronomers (people who look at the sky)in the Northern Hemisphere may see a Waxing Gibbous, but people in the Southern Hemisphere will look up and probably see a Waxing Crescent.
