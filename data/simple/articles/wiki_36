Michael Collins (Irish leader)

Michael "Mick" Collins ( 16 October 1890 – 22 August 1922) was an Irish revolutionary leader. He was a Minister for Finance and Teachta Dála (TD "member of parliament") for Cork South in the First Dáil of 1919. He was also the Director of Intelligence for the IRA, and member of the Irish delegation during the Anglo-Irish Treaty negotiations. After that he was both Chairman of the Provisional Government and Commander-in-chief of the National Army. Throughout this time, at least as of 1919, he was also President of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Under the rules of the Brotherhood this meant that he was President of the Irish Republic. Collins was shot and killed in August 1922, during the Irish Civil War.

He was born in Sam's Cross, West Cork. Michael Collins was the third son and youngest of eight children. Most biographies state his date of birth as 16 October 1890; however, his tombstone gives his date of birth as 12 October 1890. His father, also named Michael, was a member of the republican Fenian movement, but had left and settled down to farming. Michael was only six years old when his father died. 

After leaving school aged 15, Collins took the British Civil Service examination in Cork in February 1906. In 1910, he moved to London where he became a messenger at a London firm of stock brokers, Horne and Company. While in London he lived with his elder sister, and studied at King's College London. He joined the London GAA and, through this, the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a secret, oath-bound society dedicated to achieving Irish independence. In 1915, he moved to the Guaranty Trust Company of New York where he remained until his return to Ireland the following year.

Michael Collins first became known during the Easter Rising in 1916. A skilled organiser and very intelligent, he was highly respected in the IRB. When the Rising itself took place on Easter Monday, 1916, he fought alongside Patrick Pearse and others in the General Post Office in Dublin. 

Collins, like many of the other participants, was arrested, almost executed. He was imprisoned at Frongoch internment camp. Collins became one of the leading figures in Sinn Féin after the Rising. This was a small nationalist party which the British government and the Irish media wrongly blamed for the Rising. By October 1917, Collins had become a member of the executive of Sinn Féin and director of organisation of the Irish Volunteers. Éamon de Valera was president of both organisations.

Collins was nominated in the 1918 general election to elect Irish MPs to the British House of Commons in London. Collins won for Sinn Féin, becoming MP for Cork South. However, unlike their rivals in the Irish Parliamentary Party, Sinn Féin MPs had announced that they would not take their seats in Westminster, but instead would set up an Irish Parliament in Dublin.

That new parliament, called "Dáil Éireann" (meaning "Assembly of Ireland") met in the Mansion House, Dublin in January 1919, although De Valera and leading Sinn Féin MPs had been arrested. 

In de Valera's absence, Cathal Brugha was elected Príomh Aire ('Main' or 'Prime', Minister', but often translated as 'President of Dáil Éireann'). He was replaced by de Valera, when Collins helped him escape from Lincoln Prison in April 1919.

The Irish War of Independence began on the same day that the First Dáil met on 21 January 1919. An ambush party of IRA volunteers acting without orders and led by Seán Treacy attacked a group of Royal Irish Constabulary men. They were escorting a shipment of gelignite to a quarry in Soloheadbeg, County Tipperary. Two policemen were shot dead during the fight. This incident is considered to be the first action taken in the Irish War of Independence.

In 1919, Collins had a number of roles. In the summer he was elected president of the IRB, Director of Intelligence of the Irish Republican Army. He also became the Minister for Finance. His ministry was able to organise a large bond issue in the form of a "National Loan" to fund the new Irish Republic. Collins and Richard Mulcahy were the two main organisers for the Irish Republican Army, in as far as it was possible to direct the actions of disorganised guerrilla units. 

In 1920, the British offered a prize of £10,000 (equivalent to GB£300,000 / €360,000 in 2010) for information leading to the capture or death of Collins. His fame had so transcended the IRA movement that he was nicknamed "The Big Fellow". 

In July 1921, the British suddenly offered a truce. Arrangements were made for a conference between the British government and the leaders of the as-yet unrecognised Irish Republic. 

In August 1921, Eamonn de Valera made the Dáil upgrade his office from Prime Minister to President of the Irish Republic. This made him on the same level as George V in the negotiations. Eventually, however, he said that as the King would not attend, then neither would he. Instead, with the reluctant agreement of his cabinet, de Valera assembled a team of delegates to go in his place. The team was headed by Vice-President Arthur Griffith with Collins as Deputy.

The negotiations resulted in the Anglo-Irish Treaty which was signed on 6 December 1921. In it, a new state was agreed upon, called the "Irish Free State". The agreement made an all-Ireland state possible. The six-county region in the northeast could opt out of the Free State if they wanted to. If this happened, an Irish Boundary Commission was to redraw the Irish border. The Irish Free State was established in December 1922, and as expected, Northern Ireland opted to remain part of the United Kingdom proper.

Although it was not the republic he was fighting for, Collins concluded that the Treaty offered Ireland "the freedom to achieve freedom." He knew that the treaty, and in particular the issue of partition, would not be popular in Ireland. When he signed the treaty, he said "I have signed my own death warrant."

Sinn Féin split over the treaty, and the Dáil debated the matter bitterly for ten days until it was approved by a vote of 64 to 57. The Supreme Council of the IRB, which was informed in detail about the Treaty negotiations voted unanimously ("without exceptions") to accept the Treaty. The only exception was the later COS of the IRA Liam Lynch. 

As expected, the Treaty was extremely controversial in Ireland. 

First, Éamon de Valera, President of the Irish Republic until 9 January, had been unhappy that Collins had signed any deal without his and his cabinet's authorisation. 

Second, the contents of the Treaty were bitterly disputed. De Valera and many other members of the republican movement did not want Ireland to be a dominion of the British Empire. They did not like the "symbolism" of having to give a statement of faithfulness to the British king. 

The dividing of Ireland between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland was not as controversial. One of the main reasons for this was that Collins was secretly planning to launch a guerrilla war against the Northern State. In the early months of 1922, he had sent IRA units to the border, and arms and money to the northern units. In May–June 1922, he and IRA Chief of Staff Liam Lynch organised an attack of both pro- and anti-treaty IRA units along the new border. This offensive was officially called off under British pressure on 3 June and Collins issued a statement that "no troops from the 26 counties, either those under official control [pro-treaty] or those attached to the [IRA] Executive [anti-treaty] should be permitted to invade the six county area." 

The new Provisional Government () was formed under Collins, who became "President of the Provisional Government of Southern Ireland" (i.e., Prime Minister). He also remained Minister for Finance of Griffith's republican administration after de Valera stepped down. 

In the months leading up to the outbreak of civil war in June 1922, Collins tried to heal the split in the nationalist movement and prevent civil war. De Valera, having opposed the Treaty in the Dáil, withdrew from the assembly with his supporters. Collins secured a compromise, the "The Collins/De Valera Pact", whereby the two factions of Sinn Féin, pro- and anti-Treaty, would fight the soon-to-be Free State's first election jointly and form a coalition government afterwards.

To try and find a compromise, Collins proposed that the Free State would have a republican constitution, with no mention of the British king. However, the British did not sign the proposed republican constitution. They argued they had signed the Treaty in good faith and its terms could not be changed so quickly.

On 14 April 1922, a group of 200 anti-Treaty IRA men occupied the Four Courts in Dublin in defiance of the Provisional government. Collins, who wanted to avoid civil war at all costs, did not attack them until June 1922, when British pressure also forced his hand. After a final attempt to persuade the men to leave, Collins borrowed two 18 pounder artillery pieces from the British and bombarded the Four Courts until its garrison surrendered.

This led to the Irish Civil War as fighting broke out in Dublin between the anti-Treaty IRA and the provisional government's troops. 

Under Collins' supervision, the Free State rapidly took control of the capital. In July 1922, anti-Treaty forces held the southern province of Munster and several other areas of the country. De Valera and the other anti-Treaty TDs supported the anti-Treaty IRA. 

By mid-1922, Collins no longer really worked as Chairman of the Provisional Government. He became the Commander-in-Chief of the National Army, a formal uniformed army that formed around the pro-Treaty IRA. 

Collins, along with Richard Mulcahy and Eoin O'Duffy decided on a series of seaborne landings into republican held areas. They re-took Munster and the west in July–August 1922. As part of this offensive, Collins travelled to his native Cork. This was against the advice of his companions, and despite suffering from stomach ache and depression. Collins is said to have told his comrades that "They wouldn't shoot me in my own county". 
He recorded his plan for peace in his diary: Republicans must "accept the People's Verdict" on the Treaty, but could then "go home without their arms ("guns"). We don't ask for any surrender of their principles". "We want to avoid any possible unnecessary destruction and loss of life." But if Republicans did not accept his terms, "further blood is on their shoulders".

On the road to Bandon, at the village of "Béal na mBláth" (Irish, "the Mouth of Flowers"), Collins stopped to ask directions. However the man whom they asked, Dinny Long, was also a member of the local Anti-Treaty IRA. An ambush was then prepared for the convoy when it made its journey back to Cork city. They knew Collins would return by the same road as the two other roads from Bandon to Cork were destroyed by Republicans. The ambush party, commanded by Liam Deasy, opened fire on Collins' convoy.

Collins was killed in the gun battle, which lasted about 20 minutes, from 8:00 p.m. to 8:20 p.m. He was the only fatality. He had ordered his convoy to stop and return fire, instead of choosing the safer option of driving on in his touring car or transferring to the safety of the accompanying armoured car, as his companion, Emmet Dalton, had wished. They do not know who fired the fatal shot.

Collins' men brought his body back to Cork where it was then shipped to Dublin because it was feared the body might be stolen in an ambush if it were transported by road. His body lay in state for three days in Dublin City Hall where tens of thousands of mourners walked past his coffin to pay their respects. His funeral mass took place at Dublin's Pro Cathedral where a number of foreign and Irish dignitaries were in attendance. Some 500,000 people attended his funeral, almost one fifth of the country's population.

Eamon de Valera is reported to have stated in 1966:

"I can't see my way to becoming Patron of the Michael Collins Foundation. It is my considered opinion that in the fullness of time history will record the greatness of Collins and it will be recorded at my expense"
However, there is some doubt that de Valera ever made this controversial statement.

An annual commemoration ceremony takes place each year in August at the ambush site at Béal na mBláth, Cork. 

There is also a remembrance ceremony in Glasnevin at Collins' graveside.

The Collins 22 Society established in 2002 is an international organisation dedicated to keeping the name and legacy of Michael Collins in living memory. The patron of the society is Nora Owen, grand-niece of Michael Collins.

The 1936 movie "Beloved Enemy", starring David Niven, is a fictionalised account of Collins' life. Unlike the real Michael Collins, the fictionalised "Dennis Riordan" (played by Brian Aherne) is shot, but recovers. "Hang Up Your Brightest Colours", a British documentary by Kenneth Griffith, was made for ITV in 1973, but refused transmission. It was eventually screened by the BBC in Wales in 1993 and across the United Kingdom the following year.

An Irish documentary made by Colm Connolly for RTE Television in 1989 called "The Shadow of Béal na Bláth" covered Collins' death. A made for TV film, "The Treaty", was produced in 1991 and starred Brendan Gleeson as Collins and Ian Bannen as David Lloyd George. In 2007 RTE produced a documentary entitled "Get Collins", centered around the intelligence war which took place in Dublin.

Collins was the subject of director Neil Jordan's 1996 film "Michael Collins", with Liam Neeson in the title role.

School

A school is a place where people go to learn. In a school, one or more teachers or professors help pupils or students with learning. Today, most countries require that children go to school for a number of years, so that they can learn some of what they need later in life, such as reading, writing, and some basic math. However children with mental issues that are too much for the school to handle are not required to attend. This is called being expelled. These children must be given other alternatives so they can still receive required schooling. Colleges, universities and high schools are different types of schools that allow people to learn skills for future jobs.
Some people attend school longer than others. This is because some jobs require more training than others. At first, one teacher is able to teach all subjects, but later, teachers are specialized and they only teach a few subjects.

Common subjects taught include science, arts such as music and humanities, like geography and history, and languages.

There are special schools, too. That way, a truck driver that wants to get a better job later can again go to a specialized people school.

Some schools are for boys and some schools are for girls; they only accept boys, or girls, but not both. Schools were often attached to religious buildings. That way, a religion place also had a school. Since there are only monks in a monastery, this was often also true for the school, which only accepted boys. Going to a school also meant learning about religion.

In many parts of the world, schools also help children with other things:

Pedagogy is the science about teaching (children). There are different approaches to teaching. Similarly, certain schools use different approaches.

<doc id="118975" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=118975" title="Karyotype">
Karyotype

A karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes in the nucleus of a eukaryote cell. The term is also used of the complete set of chromosomes in a species, or an individual organism. It describes the number of chromosomes, and what they look like under a light microscope. Attention is paid to their length, the position of the centromeres, any differences between the sex chromosomes, and any other physical characteristics. The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of cytogenetics (cytology and genetics).

The basic number of chromosomes in the somatic (body) cells of an individual or a species is called the "somatic number" and is designated "2n". Thus, in humans 2n = 46. In the the sex cells the chromosome number is "n" (humans: n = 23).

So, in normal diploid organisms, chromosomes are present in two copies. There may, or may not, be sex chromosomes. Polyploid cells have multiple copies of chromosomes and haploid cells have single copies. The study of whole sets of chromosomes is sometimes known as "karyology". 

The chromosomes are depicted (by rearranging a microphotograph) in a standard format known as a "karyogram" or "idiogram": in pairs, ordered by size and position of centromere for chromosomes of the same size. This may be used for many purposes; such as, to show genetic disease, what sex the animal is and its diploid number. In humans, cytologists have used karyotypes to help identify genetic abnormalities a baby might have before it is born.

Karyotypes may be studied to gather information about past evolutionary events, such as polyploidy.

Liège (walloon: "Lîdje", Dutch: "Luik", German: "Lüttich") is a city in Belgium. It is the cultural centre of the Walloon region of Belgium and the capital of the province of Liège. Liège is also seat of a Roman Catholic bishop. In 2007 its population was 188,907.

It is located at 50° 38 North, 05° 34 East.

The first written trace of the city was found in 558 as „Leodicum“ or „Vicus Leodicus“. From 717, Liege was made the seat of a bishopric and became a cultural centre in the Middle Ages. These bishops ruled the city as Prince-Bishops until the 1790s. In the French Revolution, the cathedral was damaged, partially burned down and then completely detroyed. In the 19th century, the city lived on coal-mining, steel industry and trade. The region was the second biggest economic center in Europe after the UK in the 19th century.

Today Liege is a major educational hub, with a university and many high schools. It is a crossing point in Europe, Liège has the second biggest inner harbour and the 8th biggest cargo airport in Europe (Liège Airport). The city, that had a lot of problems since the 1970s because of the end of the steel industry and coal-mining, is now having a good economy thanks to the logistics and high tech industry (biotechnology, space industry, IT).

<doc id="118993" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=118993" title="Idomeneo">
Idomeneo

Idomeneo is an opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The libretto (words) are in Italian and were written by Giambattista Varesco who based it on a French text by Antoine Danchet. In 1780 Mozart and Varesco were asked by the Elector of Bavaria to write an opera for a court carnival. 

"Idomeneo" was first performed in Munich on 29 January 1781. Mozart was only 24 years old. It was the first of his great operas.

Mozart wrote three different types of opera: " Idomeneo" is an opera seria (serious opera). These were written in Italian, and are about serious, dramatic stories, often stories from Ancient Greece or Rome. "La Clemenza di Tito" is also an opera seria. "Don Giovanni" is an example of a mixture of comic and serious opera, while "The Magic Flute" is a German opera in the Singspiel tradition.

"Idomeneo" has traditional recitatives and arias. The choruses, marches, and ballets were very much like French opera tradition. Mozart was inspired by the operas of Gluck.

The story, based on an Ancient Greek story, takes place on the Island of Crete, shortly after the Trojan War. Ilia is the daughter of the Trojan King Priam who has lost the war. Ilia has been taken to Crete. She loves Prince Idamante, son of Idomeneo, but does not want to tell him about her love for him. Idamante is kind and frees the Trojan prisoners. He tells Ilia that it is not his fault that their fathers were enemies. The Trojans and Cretans (people from Crete) both welcome the return of peace, but Electra, daughter of the Greek King Agamemnon is jealous of Ilia. She is annoyed that Idamante had been kind and let the prisoners free. Arbace, the king's trusted friend, brings news that Idomeneo has been drowned at sea while returning to Crete from Troy. Electra, is worried that Ilia, a Trojan, soon will be Queen of Crete, feels the furies of Hades tormenting her.

Idomeneo is not lost at sea, but instead is saved by Neptune (god of the sea) and is washed up on a Cretan beach. There he remembers the promise he made to Neptune: he had promised to sacrifice (kill for the Gods) the first creature he should meet, whether it be a human or an animal. The first person he meets is his own son, Idamante. Because the two have not seen each other for a long time, they do not recognize one another at first. When Idomeneo finally realizes it is his own son he must kill, he tells Idamante to go away and never see him again. Idamante does not understand why his father is saying this. He is terribly upset, but runs off. The Cretan soldiers get off Idomeneo's ship and are met by their wives, and all praise Neptune.

At the king's palace, Idomeneo asks Arbace what he should do, because he has disobeyed the god. Arbace says that Neptune would be happy if another victim could be sacrificed so long as Idamante is sent into exile (to another country). Idomeneo tells his son to take Electra to her home, Argos. Idomeneo's kind words to Ilia make her say very kindly that, because she has lost everything, he will be her father and Crete will be her country. As she leaves, Idomeneo realizes that sending Idamante into exile has made Ilia unhappy. Electra is happy about going to Argos with Idamante.

At the port of Sidon, Idomeneo says goodbye to his son and tells him to rule like a good king. Before the ship can sail, however, a storm breaks out, and a sea serpent appears. It is a messenger from Neptune, who is angry with Idomeneo. Idomeneo offers his life to the god.

In the royal garden, Ilia asks the gentle winds to carry her love to Idamante. Idamante says he must go to fight the serpent. When he says he would like to die because Ilia does not love him. This makes Ilia tell him that she loves him. They are surprised by Electra and Idomeneo. When Idamante asks his father why he sends him away, Idomeneo cannot tell him the truth. Ilia asks Electra for some kindness, but Elektra is madly jealous of Ilia now, and she wants revenge. Arbace comes with news that the people, led by the High Priest of Neptune, are shouting that they want Idomeneo. The High Priest tells the king that Neptune's monster is destroying things, and asks Idomeneo to say the name of the person whose sacrifice is demanded by the god. When the king says that his own son is the victim, the people are horrified. 

Outside the temple, the king and High Priest join with Neptune's priests to pray that the god will be kind and merciful. Arbace brings news that Idamante has killed the monster. Idomeneo is now worried that Neptune will want even more revenge. Idamante enters in sacrificial robes, saying he understands his father's terrible worries and he is ready to die., Idomeneo says a tragic goodbye to his own son and is about to kill him, when Ilia steps forward and offers to die instead. Neptune now changes his mind. We hear his voice saying that if Idomeneo gives up being king and lets Idamante and Ilia rule as king and queen, he will forgive. Everyone is happy except Electra, who wants to die. Idomeneo says that Idamante and his bride as the new rulers. The people call upon the god of love and marriage to bless the royal pair and bring peace.

Carbohydrate

Carbohydrates are chemical compounds that contain "only" oxygen, hydrogen and carbon. They consist of joined-up sugars with the general formula C(HO). They are also known as saccharides.

Certain carbohydrates are an important storage and transport form of energy in most organisms, including plants and animals.

There are four types of carbohydrates, named by the number of sugar molecules they contain. 

In fact, human beings can live without eating foods with carbohydrates. The human body changes protein into carbohydrates, and so if a human being eats only food with protein, they can still live. People of some cultures eat food with very little carbohydrates, but they still remain healthy. 

Still, carbohydrates are the most common source of energy for the human body. Protein build tissue and cells in the body. Carbohydrates are best for energy, but, if you eat more than you need, the extra goes into making fat.

Researches in the United States and Canada have shown that people get about 40% to 60% of energy from carbohydrates. However, studies suggest that people should eat carbohydrates to get at least 55% to 75% of energy from carbohydrates. 

Some foods have high carbohydrates in them. These foods include breads, pastas, potatoes, bran and cereals.

The town is near the Dutch border and is in fact closer to the city of Eindhoven than Antwerp.

The official language of the area is Dutch, but many people especially in the hospitality industry speak English and French.

Services

Services are basic in Retie, some banks have branches including ING and AXA. Supermarket shopping is available. Bakeries in Retie are very good. Like most of Belgium the shops are generally closed on Sunday.

The Gemeente (local council) official website (in Dutch) is http://www.retie.be/ 

Things to do in and around Retie

There is a pretty town hall in the centre of the town, but unlike many Belgian towns it is not organised around a town square (well it is now just a large intersection) and therefore does not have the quaint village feel as many other small towns in this part of Belgium (for example Lommel, Mol).

The main attraction of the town is Prinsenpark - a public forest that is popular with families and walking/jogging groups. Dogs on leads are allowed. There are picnic tables and toilets.

Mast-Allah

A Mast-Allah (usually just called a mast or must) is a kind of spiritual person in the part of the Muslim religion called Sufism. Masts sometimes seem strange or crazy to people who don't know about them, but Sufis of Iran, Pakistan, and India believe they are not really crazy, but are saints. 

The Indian teacher Meher Baba asked a doctor named William Donkin to write a book about masts called "The Wayfarers." Wayfarer means wanderer, and the book's title implied that masts are on a spiritual journey. Meher Baba wrote the introduction of the book. In his introduction Meher Baba explained that masts are traveling along an internal path and are lost because they are so dazzled (amazed) by the sights they see. They are so amazed and dazzled by these sights they see that they forget how to act normally. So Meher Baba says they are like people who are drunk, only the masts are not drunk on alcohol but on God and are very close to God.

Sofiensaal

Sofiensaal (or Sofiensäle) is the name of a former public bath and concert venue in Vienna. It was built as a public bath in the years 1845-1848 by Eduard van der Nüll and August Sicard von Sicardsburg. It was used as a bath in winter. During the summer, the swimming pool was covered with wooden planks. The venue could then be used for concerts, and as a dance venue. In March 1912 Karl May gave his last public speech there. He had an audience of about 2000 people. In September 1913, the first films that had sound were shown in the building. This was later stopped however, as there were problems with making sure the sound was at the right time in the film (called synchronicity). 

In May 1938, Richard Suchenwirth founded the NSDAP Austria section there. During the war, the venue was used to collect the Jews (who were later deported). The building was restored to its former glory by Carl Appel in 1948. In the 1950, DECCA installed the most modern recording studio in Europe in the rooms. The studio was used until the 1970s, to make recordings of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, amongst others.

In the 1990s, it was used as a clubbing venue.

It burned down completely in a fire, in 2001. Today, 3 walls of the bigger room (with the pool) are left, as well as some remains of the outer walls and façade. The latest plans are to rebuild it as a hotel.

Ordinary language philosophy

Ordinary language philosophy is a way of doing philosophy that uses ordinary, everyday words. It came out of analytic philosophy, the most common way of doing philosophy in English-speaking countries in the 20th century.

Analytic philosophers like Bertrand Russell thought that ordinary language was confused, and tried to use the ideal or most accurate words to describe ideas. Ordinary language philosophers thought that analytic philosophers had a problem with forgetting what words really mean. They thought that using ordinary words would make their ideas clearer and their mistakes easier to spot.

Ordinary language philosophy came out of followers of the later work of Ludwig Wittgenstein at the University of Oxford, and was most popular between 1930 and 1970.

<doc id="119382" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=119382" title="La Clemenza di Tito">
La Clemenza di Tito

La Clemenza di Tito is a libretto written by Pietro Metastasio in 1734. It has been used by nearly 40 different composers. The most famous version is by Mozart.

Vitellia, is the daughter of Vitellius who has lost his position of emperor. Vitellius wants revenge against Titus. Vitellia asks Titus's friend Sextus, who is in love with her, to act against him. But when she hears that Titus has sent Berenice of Cilicia, of whom she was jealous, back to Jerusalem, Vitellia tells Sextus to wait a while before doing what she had asked, hoping Titus will choose her (Vitellia) as his empress.

Titus, however, decides to choose Sextus's sister Servilia to be his empress, and tells Annius (Sextus's friend) to take the message to Servilia. Annius and Servilia are in love, although Titus does not know this, so neither of them like this news. Servilia decides to tell Titus the truth but also says that if Titus still insists on marrying her, she will obey. Titus thanks the gods for Servilia's truthfulness and immediately promises to give up the idea of coming between her and Annius.

In the meantime, however, Vitellia has heard the news about Titus's interest in Servilia and is again very jealous. She urges Sextus to kill Titus. He agrees, singing one of the opera's most famous arias, "Parto, parto." Almost as soon as he leaves, Annius and the guard Publius arrive to take Vitellia to Titus, who has now chosen her as his empress. She is torn with feelings of guilt and worry over what she has sent Sextus to do. 

Sextus, meanwhile, is at the Capitol, which he and his friends are going to burn down. Sextus cannot think what is the right thing to do. The other characters (except Titus) enter and are horrified to see the burning Capitol. Sextus comes in again and says that he saw Titus being killed, but Vitellia stops him giving away the fact that he was the killer. The others lament Titus in a slow, sad end to Act I.

Begins with Annius telling Sextus that Emperor Titus is in fact alive and has just been seen. In the smoke and chaos, Sextus thought he has seen Titus, but it was someone else. Soon Publius arrives to arrest Sextus, bringing the news that it was one of Sextus’ friends who dressed himself in Titus's robes and was stabbed by Sextus, but he did not die. The Senate take a court case against Sextus as Titus waits impatiently, sure that his friend will be found not guilty; but the Senate finds him guilty, and a terribly sad Titus must sign Sextus' death papers. 

He decides to send for Sextus first, trying to get further details about the plot. Sextus takes all the guilt on himself and says he deserves death, so Titus tells him he shall have death, and sends him away. But after a lot of painful thinking, Titus tears up the execution papers for Sextus and decides that, if the world wants to accuse him (Titus) of anything, then people can say that he allowed too much mercy, insteady of saying that he always wanted revenge. 

Vitellia feels terrible about what has happened and decides to tell all the truth to Titus, giving up her hopes of empire. In the amphitheater, the condemned (including Sextus) are waiting to be thrown to the wild animals. Titus is about to show mercy when Vitellia explains that she started Sextus's plot. Though shocked, the emperor includes her in the general clemency (forgiveness) he offers. The opera finishes with all the people praising the kindness of Titus, while he himself asks the gods to end his life if he ever stops caring for the good of Rome. 

In July 1791 Mozart was asked to write an "opera seria". He had been asked by Domenico Guardasoni who lived in Prague and who had the job of finding someone to compose an opera for the celebrations of the coronation of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor as King of Bohemia. The ceremony would take place on September 6, so Mozart had to work quickly.

Guardasoni had asked Antonio Salieri to write the opera, but Salieri was too busy, so he then asked Mozart. Mozart was glad to accept, because he was paid twice as much as when he wrote an opera for Vienna.

Eine kleine Nachtmusik is the name given to the Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major, K 525 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It is one of his most popular pieces and the opening tune is heard in many places, e.g. on mobile phones.

The title "Eine kleine Nachtmusik" means literally: "A little Night Music". "Nachtmusik" was a title which was often given to serenades in the 18th century. A serenade in the 18th century was a lighthearted piece of music, often played during feasts. This serenade is written for two violins, viola, and cello and possibly a double bass as well. It is either performed as a string quartet (just four players) or by a small group of instruments, in which case at least one double bass is normally added.

There are four movements:


The first movement has this famous opening tune:

The movement is in sonata form. A short while after the famous opening theme comes a second theme which is more graceful and in D major, the dominant key of G major. The first part (exposition) closes in D major and is repeated. The next part (development section) begins on D major and goes to other keys before the music returns to G major for the last part (recapitulation).

The second movement is a "Romanza". It is marked "Andante" ("at a walking pace"). It is gentler and slower than the first movement. Three tunes are heard during the movement, which has an ABACA structure.

The third movement is a minuet and trio (ABA) in G major.

The fourth and last movement is in sonata rondo form. This finale returns with the liveliness of the first movement.

Super Bowl XXXIV

Super Bowl XXXIV (or Super Bowl 34) was a Super Bowl game between the St. Louis Rams and the Tennessee Titans in the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1999 regular season. The Rams won against the Titans 23–16. The game was played on January 30, 2000 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia.
It is best remembered for the final play of the game, where Mike Jones of St Louis tackled Kevin Dyson of Tennessee at the one yard line as time ran out, thus stopping Tennessee from scoring a touchdown that could have tied the game.

Both teams did not play well early on in the game. St. Louis went inside the "Red zone" (the final 20 yards) of Tennessee's half six times in the first half, but only scored four times - three field goals, and one touchdown. They missed one field goal try, and had to abort another due to a bad snap. Tennessee also missed a field goal in the fist half. This gave St Louis a 16-0 lead at half time.
In the second half, Tennessee fought back, with two Touchdowns - but only scored the extra point on one of them, and then tied the game with a field goal.
St. Louis then scored in just one play to take the lead again, 23-16, with fewer than two minutes left.
With only one time-out remaining, Tennessee tried to drive into the End zone to score a touchdown that could have tied the game if they made the extra point. However, after using their time-out with just six seconds left, the final play had Kevin Dyson tackled at the one yard line. The time ran out, and St. Louis won the game.

St. Louis quarterback Kurt Warner was named the game's Most Valuable Player (MVP).

The split was made to accommodate the eventual division of Belgium in three regions (Flanders, Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region).

Spreadsheet

A Spreadsheet is a computer program that imitates a paper worksheet. It shows a large sheet (like a sheet of paper) that has many cells in a grid of rows and columns. Users can put words or numbers into the cells, to make headings and store information (usually numbers). You can also move the grid lines around so that some cells are bigger than others, and change the color or size of text/font, the same way font/text is changed in a word processor. You can even put pictures in the worksheets, make multiple pages, and print out their results on real paper.

The primary reason most people use spreadsheets, is for automatic calculations. Spreadsheets can be designed to add up the items/amounts on a bill, calculate sales tax, and even calculate income tax. A user can add and subtract the numbers here, even if the numbers are not next to each other. This means the computer does all the math, and people only need to give the correct information.

Another strength of spreadsheets, is that they can produce diagrams, like graphs and pie-charts, based on the data the user enters. Sometimes the numbers make more sense when the computer turns them into a picture.

<doc id="119711" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=119711" title="Abiogenesis">
Abiogenesis

Abiogenesis is the study of how the first life forms grew out of non-living matter. The word is made of two parts. One part comes from the Ancient Greek "bios", which means life. The other comes from "genesis", which means birth or origin. Some people talk about 'chemical evolution'; others talk about the beginnings of biological evolution. The study of abiogenesis uses many sciences. It is related to chemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, earth science, and astronomy. 

People like Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck and Charles Darwin saw that the plants and animals on earth change over time. They developed theories to explain this phenomenon: Lamarck developed Lamarckism, and Darwin developed the Darwinian theory of Evolution. This article is not about biological theories of evolution, it looks at the borderland between chemistry and life.

A scientific study from 2002 shows that geological formations of stromatolites 3.45 billion years old contain fossilized cyanobacteria. It is now widely agreed that stromatolites are oldest known life on earth which have left a record of their existence.

Therefore it follows that abiogenesis happened sometime between 4.4 billion years ago, when water vapor first liquefied, and 3.5 billion years ago. 

By 2.5 million years ago the ratio of stable isotopes of carbon, iron and sulfur point to a biogenic origin of minerals and sediments, and molecular biomarkers indicate photosynthesis.

Even though it has a great "potential" impact on how people understand the world, abiogenesis is a limited field of study. It is not well funded, and progress is slow. This is mainly because there are few established facts, and it is not clear how research should proceed. A single well-established fact, such as the discovery of clear evidence of life on another planet, would have a great effect. This is because the question investigated is so important. 

There are several main theories: The most notable are called iron-sulfur world theory (also called "metabolism first") and RNA world hypothesis (also called "genetics first").

Until the early 19th century many people believed in the regular spontaneous generation of life from non-living matter. 

The theory known as "spontaneous generation" held that complex, living organisms appear in decaying organic substances. Mice might appear in stored grain or maggots could appear in meat.

According to Aristotle, it was an easily seen truth that aphids arise from the dew which falls on plants, fleas from decaying matter, mice from dirty hay, crocodiles from logs rotting at the bottom of bodies of water, and so forth. 

In the 17th century these things started to be questioned. Sir Thomas Browne wrote a book called "Pseudodoxia Epidemica", in 1646. He gave it the subtitle "Enquiries into very many received tenets, and commonly presumed truths". Browne wrote it as an attack on "false beliefs and "vulgar errors"". Others did not accept his views. Browne's contemporary, Alexander Ross, wrote: "To question this (spontaneous generation) is to question reason, sense and experience. If he doubts of this let him go to Egypt, and there he will find the fields swarming with mice, begot of the mud of Nylus, to the great calamity of the inhabitants".

In 1546 the physician Girolamo Fracastoro thought epidemic diseases were caused by tiny, invisible particles or "spores", which might not be living creatures. This was a landmark idea, but it was not widely accepted. Next, Robert Hooke published the first drawings of a microorganism in 1665. He was the first to use the term 'cell' for the things he saw in cork samples. In 1676, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek discovered microorganisms that were probably protozoa and bacteria. This sparked new interest in the microscopic world. 

The first experiments were done by the Italian Francesco Redi. In 1668, Redi showed that no maggots appeared in meat when flies were prevented from laying eggs. From the 17th century onwards it was gradually shown that, at least in the case of all the higher and readily visible organisms, the previous ideas were false. The alternative seemed to be "omne vivum ex ovo": that every living thing came from a pre-existing living thing (literally, everything from an egg). 

In 1768 Lazzaro Spallanzani proved that microbes came from the air, and could be killed by boiling. Yet it was not until 1861 that Louis Pasteur performed a series of careful experiments. With these experiments, Pasteur proved that organisms such as bacteria and fungi do not appear in nutrient-rich media of their own accord in non-living material. This experiment supported the cell theory. All ideas of antisepsis in surgery date from this work.

By the middle of the 19th century, Pasteur and other scientists had shown that living organisms did not arise spontaneously from non-living matter. This raised the question of how life might have come about within a naturalistic framework. 

In a letter to Joseph Dalton Hooker on 11 February 1871, Charles Darwin proposed a "natural process" for the origin of life. 

He suggested that the original spark of life may have begun in a "warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, lights, heat, electricity, etc. A protein compound was then chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes". He went on to explain that "at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed". 

In other words, because there is life on Earth, a laboratory with its controlled (sterile) conditions is needed to search for the origin of life.

No real progress was made until 1924 when Alexander Oparin reasoned that atmospheric oxygen prevented the synthesis of the organic molecules. Organic molecules are the necessary building blocks for the evolution of life. In his "The Origin of Life", Oparin argued that a "primeval soup" of organic molecules could be created in an oxygen-less atmosphere through the action of sunlight. These would combine in ever-more complex fashions until they formed droplets. These droplets would "grow" by fusion with other droplets, and "reproduce" through fission into daughter droplets, and so have a primitive metabolism in which those factors which promote "cell integrity" survive, those that do not become extinct. Many modern theories of the origin of life still take Oparin's ideas as a starting point.

Around the same time J.B.S. Haldane also suggested that the Earth's pre-biotic oceans, which were very different from what oceans are now, would have formed a "hot dilute soup". In this soup, organic compounds, the building blocks of life, could have formed. This idea was called biopoiesis, the process of living matter evolving from self-replicating but nonliving molecules.

A study done in 1998 suggests that oceans may have appeared in the Hadean eon, about 200 million years after the earth had formed. According to the study, it was very hot then (about 100 °C at the start, dropping to 70°C during the Hadean). The environment helped chemical reductions. The pH was about 5.8 at first, but it rapidly rose towards neutral. Another study supports this theory. The date of the zircon crystals found in the metamorphosed quartzite of Mount Narryer in Western Australia, has been pushed to 4.404 billion years. Beforehand, they were thought to be 4.1–4.2 billion years old. This means that oceans and continental crust existed within 150 million years of Earth's formation. 

Despite this, the environment that existed in the Hadean was hostile to life, but how much so is not known. Large objects, which could be up to 500 km across, often collided. This might have been enough to make the ocean disappear within a few months of the impact. This would lead to high-altitude vapour clouds covering the planet. After a few months the height of these clouds would have begun to decrease but the cloud base would still have been elevated for about the next thousand years. After that, it would have begun to rain at low altitude. For another two thousand years rains would slowly have drawn down the height of the clouds, returning the oceans to their original depth only 3,000 years after the impact event.

There was a time between 3.8 and 4.1 billion years ago, that is known as Late Heavy Bombardment today. It is named that way because many lunar craters are thought to have formed then. The situation on other planets, such as Earth,
Venus, Mercury and Mars must have been similar. These impacts would likely have sterilised the earth (and killed all life), if it had existed at that time.

Different environments existed between such devastating events. The time when life came to be depends on where it came into existence. A study shows that if life came to be in the deep ocean, near a hydrothermal vent, life could have originated as early as 4 to 4.2 billion years ago. If, on the other hand, life originated at the surface of the planet, a common (but not proven) opinion is it could only have done so between 3.5 and 4 billion years ago.

Life might also have started in a colder environment. A study has shown that freezing temperatures have advantages for the origin of life. This is because precursors such as HCN are more concentrated at lower temperatures. Another study suggested that adenine and guanine require freezing temperatures for synthesis, but cytosine and uracil are better synthesised at boiling temperatures. Based on this research it was suggested the beginning of life involved freezing conditions and exploding meteorites. An article in a scientific publication suggests that seven different amino acids and 11 types of nucleobases formed in ice when ammonia and cyanide were left in a freezer from 1972–1997. This article also describes research showing the formation of RNA molecules 400 bases long under freezing conditions using an RNA template, a single-strand chain of RNA that guides the formation of a new strand of RNA. As that new RNA strand grows, it adheres to the template. The explanation given for the unusual speed of these reactions at such a low temperature is eutectic freezing. As an ice crystal forms, it stays pure: only molecules of water join the growing crystal, while impurities like salt or cyanide are excluded. These impurities become crowded in microscopic pockets of liquid within the ice, and this crowding causes the molecules to collide more often.

Evidence of the early appearance of life comes from the Isua supercrustal belt in Western Greenland and from similar formations in the nearby Akilia Islands. Carbon entering into rock formations has a concentration of elemental δC of about −5.5, where because of a preferential biotic uptake of C, biomass has a δC of between −20 and −30. These isotopic fingerprints are preserved in the sediments, and Mojzis has used this technique to suggest that life existed on the planet already by 3.85 billion years ago. 

Lazcano and Miller (1994) suggest that the rapidity of the evolution of life is dictated by the rate of recirculating water through mid-ocean submarine vents. Complete recirculation takes 10 million years, thus any organic compounds produced by then would be altered or destroyed by temperatures exceeding 300 °C. They estimate that the development of a 100 kilobase genome of a DNA/protein primitive heterotroph into a 7000 gene filamentous cyanobacterium would have required only 7 million years.

There is no "standard model" on how life started. Most accepted models at the moment are mostly about a few of the same discoveries. These discoveries are on how different parts of cells and molecules started. They are listed here, in the order they started:


The origin of the basic biomolecules, while not settled, is less controversial than the significance and order of steps 2 and 3. The basic chemicals from which life is thought to have formed are:
Molecular oxygen (O) and ozone (O) were either rare or absent.

As of 2008, no one has yet synthesized a "protocell" using basic components which would have the necessary properties of life (the so-called ""bottom-up-approach""). Without such a proof-of-principle, explanations have tended to be short on specifics. However, some researchers are working in this field, notably Steen Rasmussen at Los Alamos National Laboratory and Jack Szostak at Harvard University. Others have argued that a ""top-down approach"" is more feasible. One such approach, attempted by Craig Venter and others at The Institute for Genomic Research, involves engineering existing prokaryotic cells with progressively fewer genes, attempting to discern at which point the most minimal requirements for life were reached. The biologist John Desmond Bernal, coined the term Biopoesis for this process, and suggested that there were a number of clearly defined "stages" that could be recognised in explaining the origin of life.

Bernal suggested that evolution may have commenced early, some time between Stage 1 and 2.

There are three sources of organic molecules on the early Earth: 

Recently estimates of these sources suggest that the heavy bombardment before 3.5 Gyr ago within the early atmosphere made available quantities of organics comparable to those produced by other energy sources.

In 1953 a graduate student, Stanley Miller, and his professor, Harold Urey, performed an experiment that showed how organic molecules could have formed on early Earth from inorganic precursors. 

The now-famous Miller–Urey experiment used a highly reduced mixture of gases – methane, ammonia and hydrogen – to form basic organic monomers, such as amino acids.

Whether the mixture of gases used in the Miller-Urey experiment truly reflects the atmospheric content of early Earth is a controversial topic. Other less reducing gases produce a lower yield and variety. It was once thought that a large amount of molecular oxygen was present in the prebiotic atmosphere, which would have stopped the formation of organic molecules; however, this is not the case. We now know that for more than the first half of the Earth's history its atmosphere had almost no oxygen. 

The next most important step in research on prebiotic organic synthesis was the demonstration by John Oró that the nucleic acid purine base, adenine, was formed by the simple heating of solutions of ammonium cyanide.

Simple organic molecules are, of course, a long way from a fully functional self-replicating life form. But in an environment with no pre-existing life these molecules may have accumulated and provided a rich environment for chemical evolution (primordial soup theory). 

The spontaneous formation of complex polymers from amino acids and purines is not at all a straightforward process. Besides the necessary basic organic monomers, compounds that would have prohibited the formation of polymers were formed in high concentration during the experiments.

The most crucial unanswered challenge is how the relatively simple organic building blocks form more complex structures, and form a protocell.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Sidney W. Fox studied the spontaneous formation of peptide structures under conditions that might plausibly have existed early in Earth's history. 

He demonstrated that amino acids could spontaneously form small peptides. These amino acids and small peptides could be encouraged to form closed spherical membranes, called microspheres. This was a step forward in spontaneous biosynthesis.

Some scientists have suggested special physical conditions which could make cell synthesis easier. 

A clay model for the origin of life was suggested by A. Graham Cairns-Smith. Clay theory postulates that complex organic molecules arose gradually on a pre-existing non-organic platform, namely, silicate crystals in solution.

In the 1970s, Thomas Gold proposed the theory that life first developed not on the surface of the Earth, but several kilometers below the surface. The discovery in the late 1990s of nanobes (filamental structures that are smaller than bacteria, but that may contain DNA in deep rocks) might be seen as lending support to Gold's theory.

It is now reasonably well established that microbial life is plentiful at shallow depths in the Earth (up to five kilometers below the surface) in the form of extremophile archaea, rather than the better-known eubacteria (which live in more accessible conditions). It is claimed that discovery of microbial life below the surface of another body in our solar system would lend significant credence to this theory. 

Gold also asserted that a trickle of food from a deep, unreachable, source is needed for survival because life arising in a puddle of organic material is likely to consume all of its food and become extinct. Gold's theory is that flow of food is due to out-gassing of primordial methane from the Earth's mantle; more conventional explanations of the food supply of deep microbes (away from sedimentary carbon compounds) is that the organisms subsist on hydrogen released by an interaction between water and (reduced) iron compounds in rocks

Chirality is a special issue. Some process in chemical evolution must account for the origin of homochirality, i.e. all building blocks in living organisms having the same "handedness". Amino acids are left-handed, nucleic acid sugars (ribose and deoxyribose) right-handed. 

Chiral molecules can be synthesized, but in the absence of a chiral source or a chiral catalyst are formed in a 50/50 mixture of both kinds. This is called a racemic mixture. Clark has suggested that homochirality may have started in space, as the studies of the amino acids on the Murchison meteorite showed L-alanine to be more than twice as frequent as its D form, and L-glutamic acid was more than 3 times prevalent than its D counterpart. It is suggested that polarised light has the power to destroy one kind within the proto-planetary disk. Noyes showed that beta decay caused the breakdown of D-leucine, in a racemic mixture, and that the presence of C, present in larger amounts in organic chemicals in the early Earth environment, could have been the cause. 

Robert M. Hazen reports upon experiments conducted in which various chiral crystal surfaces, act as sites for possible concentration and assembly of chiral monomer units into macromolecules. Once established, chirality would be selected for. 

Work with organic compounds found on meteorites tends to suggest that chirality is a characteristic of abiogenic synthesis, as amino acids show a left-handed bias, whereas sugars show a predominantly right-handed bias.

Features of self-organization and self-replication are the hallmark of living systems. There are instances of abiotic molecules exhibiting such characteristics under proper conditions. For example, Martin and Russel show that cell membranes separating contents from the environment and self-organization of self-contained redox reactions are the most conserved attributes of living things. 

They argue that inorganic matter with such attributes would be life's most likely last common ancestor.

The question "How do simple organic molecules form a protocell?" is largely unanswered but there are many hypotheses. Some of these postulate the early appearance of nucleic acids ("genes-first") whereas others postulate the evolution of biochemical reactions and pathways first ("metabolism-first"). Recently, trends are emerging to create hybrid models that combine aspects of both.

The RNA world hypothesis suggests that relatively short RNA molecules could have spontaneously formed that were capable of catalyzing their own continuing replication. It is difficult to gauge the probability of this formation. A number of theories of modes of formation have been put forward. Early cell membranes could have formed spontaneously from proteinoids, protein-like molecules that are produced when amino acid solutions are heated – when present at the correct concentration in aqueous solution, these form microspheres which are observed to behave similarly to membrane-enclosed compartments. Other possibilities include systems of chemical reactions taking place within clay substrates or on the surface of pyrite rocks. Factors supportive of an important role for RNA in early life include its ability to act both to store information and catalyse chemical reactions (as a ribozyme); its many important roles as an intermediate in the expression and maintenance of the genetic information (in the form of DNA) in modern organisms; and the ease of chemical synthesis of at least the components of the molecule under conditions approximating the early Earth. Relatively short RNA molecules which can duplicate others have been artificially produced in the lab.

Researchers have pointed out difficulties for the abiogenic synthesis of nucleotides from cytosine and uracil. Cytosine has a half-life of 19 days at 100 °C and 17,000 years in freezing water. Larralde et al., say that "the generally accepted prebiotic synthesis of ribose, the formose reaction, yields numerous sugars without any selectivity." and they conclude that their "results suggest that the backbone of the first genetic material could not have contained ribose or other sugars because of their instability." The ester linkage of ribose and phosphoric acid in RNA is known to be prone to hydrolysis.

A slightly different version of this hypothesis is that a different type of nucleic acid, such as PNA, TNA or GNA, was the first one to emerge as a self-reproducing molecule, to be replaced by RNA only later.

Many think the idea that a "naked gene" replicates all by itself is false. Rather, they say that a primitive metabolism emerged. This metabolism would provide an environment, so that RNA replication could emerge later. 

One of the first to think this idea could be true was Oparin. In 1924, Oparin talked about primitive vesicles that replicated themselves. This was before the structure of the DNA was found. In the 1980s and 1990s, Günter Wächtershäuser came up with the iron-sulfur world theory and Christian de Duve introduced models based on the chemistry of thioesters.
Some people also had more abstract and theoretical models as an explanation why a metabolism could emerge without genes. Freeman Dyson introduced a mathematical model in the 1980s. Stuart Kauffman developed the notion of autocatalytic sets, which was discussed later in that decade. 

However, the idea that a closed metabolic cycle, such as the reductive citric acid cycle, could form spontaneously (proposed by Günter Wächtershäuser) remains unsupported. According to Leslie Orgel, a leader in origin-of-life studies for the past several decades, there is reason to believe the assertion will remain so. In an article entitled "Self-Organizing Biochemical Cycles", Orgel summarizes his analysis of the proposal by stating, "There is at present no reason to expect that multistep cycles such as the reductive citric acid cycle will self-organize on the surface of FeS/FeS2 or some other mineral." It is possible that another type of metabolic pathway was used at the beginning of life. For example, instead of the reductive citric acid cycle, the "open" acetyl-CoA pathway (another one of the four recognised ways of carbon dioxide fixation in nature today) would be even more compatible with the idea of self-organisation on a metal sulfide surface. The key enzyme of this pathway, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase harbours mixed nickel-iron-sulfur clusters in its reaction centers and catalyses the formation of acetyl-CoA (which may be regarded as a modern form of acetyl-thiol) in a single step.

Waves breaking on the shore create a delicate foam composed of bubbles. Winds sweeping across the ocean have a tendency to drive things to shore, much like driftwood collecting on the beach. It is possible that organic molecules were concentrated on the shorelines in much the same way. Shallow coastal waters also tend to be warmer, further concentrating the molecules through evaporation. While bubbles composed mostly of water burst quickly, water containing amphiphiles forms much more stable bubbles, lending more time to the particular bubble to perform these crucial experiments.

Amphiphiles are oily compounds containing a hydrophilic head on one or both ends of a hydrophobic molecule. Some amphiphiles have the tendency to spontaneously form membranes in water. A spherically closed membrane contains water and is a hypothetical precursor to the modern cell membrane. If a protein came along that increased the integrity of its parent bubble, then that bubble had an advantage, and was placed at the top of the natural selection waiting list. Primitive reproduction can be envisioned when the bubbles burst, releasing the results of the experiment into the surrounding medium. Once enough of the 'right stuff' was released into the medium, the development of the first prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and multicellular organisms could be achieved.

Similarly, bubbles formed entirely out of protein-like molecules, called microspheres, will form spontaneously under the right conditions. But they are not a likely precursor to the modern cell membrane, as cell membranes are composed primarily of lipid compounds rather than amino-acid compounds (for types of membrane spheres associated with abiogenesis, see protobionts, micelle, coacervate).

A recent model by Fernando and Rowe suggests that the enclosure of an autocatalytic non-enzymatic metabolism within protocells may have been one way of avoiding the side-reaction problem that is typical of metabolism first models.

An alternative to Earthly abiogenesis is the hypothesis that primitive life may have originally formed extraterrestrially, either in space or on a nearby planet (Mars). (Note that exogenesis is related to, but not the same as, the notion of panspermia). A supporter of this theory was Francis Crick.

Organic compounds are relatively common in space, especially in the outer solar system where volatiles are not evaporated by solar heating. Comets are encrusted by outer layers of dark material, thought to be a tar-like substance composed of complex organic material formed from simple carbon compounds after reactions initiated mostly by irradiation by ultraviolet light. It is supposed that a rain of material from comets could have brought significant quantities of such complex organic molecules to Earth.

An alternative but related hypothesis, proposed to explain the presence of life on Earth so soon after the planet had cooled down, with apparently very little time for prebiotic evolution, is that life formed first on early Mars. Due to its smaller size Mars cooled before Earth (a difference of hundreds of millions of years), allowing prebiotic processes there while Earth was still too hot. Life was then transported to the cooled Earth when crustal material was blasted off Mars by asteroid and comet impacts. Mars continued to cool faster and eventually became hostile to the continued evolution or even existence of life (it lost its atmosphere due to low volcanism), Earth is following the same fate as Mars, but at a slower rate.

Neither hypothesis actually answers the question of how life first originated, but merely shifts it to another planet or a comet. However, the advantage of an extraterrestrial origin of primitive life is that life is not required to have evolved on each planet it occurs on, but rather in a single location, and then spread about the galaxy to other star systems via cometary and/or meteorite impact. Evidence to support the plausibility of the concept is scant, but it finds support in recent study of Martian meteorites found in Antarctica and in studies of extremophile microbes. Additional support comes from a recent discovery of a bacterial ecosytem whose energy source is radioactivity.

A recent experiment led by Jason Dworkin, subjected a frozen mixture of water, methanol, ammonia and carbon monoxide to UV radiation, mimicking conditions found in an extraterrestrial environment. This combination yielded large numbers of organic material that self-organised to form bubbles when immersed in water. Dworkin considered these bubbles to resemble cell membranes that enclose and concentrate the chemistry of life, separating their interior from the outside world.

The bubbles produced in these experiments were between 10 to 40 micrometers, or about the size of red blood cells. Remarkably, the bubbles fluoresced, or glowed, when exposed to UV light. Absorbing UV and converting it into visible light in this way was considered one possible way of providing energy to a primitive cell. If such bubbles played a role in the origin of life, the fluorescence could have been a precursor to primitive photosynthesis. Such fluorescence also provides the benefit of acting as a sunscreen, diffusing any damage that otherwise would be inflicted by UV radiation. Such a protective function would have been vital for life on the early Earth, since the ozone layer, which blocks out the sun's most destructive UV rays, did not form until after photosynthetic life began to produce oxygen.

Other sources of complex molecules have been postulated, including extraterrestrial stellar or interstellar origin. For example, from spectral analyses, organic molecules are known to be present in comets and meteorites. In 2004, a team detected traces of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's) in a nebula. Those are the most complex molecules so far found in space. The use of PAH's has also been proposed as a precursor to the RNA world in the PAH world hypothesis. The Spitzer Space Telescope has recently detected a star, HH 46-IR, which is forming by a process similar to the sun. In the disk of material surrounding the star, there is a very large range of molecules, including cyanide compounds, hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide. PAHs have also been found all over the surface of galaxy M81, which is 12 million light years away from the Earth, confirming their widespread distribution in space.

There is a theory that ascribes the first self-replicating object to be lipid-like. It is known that phospholipids form bilayers in water while under agitation– the same structure as in cell membranes. These molecules were not present on early earth, however other amphiphilic long chain molecules also form membranes. Furthermore, these bodies may expand (by insertion of additional lipids), and under excessive expansion may undergo spontaneous splitting which preserves the same size and composition of lipids in the two progenies. The main idea in this theory is that the molecular composition of the lipid bodies is the preliminary way for information storage, and evolution led to the appearance of polymer entities such as RNA or DNA that may store information favorably. Still, no biochemical mechanism has been offered to support the Lipid World theory.

The problem with most scenarios of abiogenesis is that the thermodynamic equilibrium of amino acid versus peptides is in the direction of separate amino acids. What has been missing is some force that drives polymerization. The resolution of this problem may well be in the properties of polyphosphates. Polyphosphates are formed by polymerization of ordinary monophosphate ions PO. Several mechanisms for such polymerization have been suggested. Polyphosphates cause polymerization of amino acids into peptides. They are also logical precursors in the synthesis of such key biochemical compounds as ATP. A key issue seems to be that calcium reacts with soluble phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate (apatite), so some plausible mechanism must be found to keep calcium ions from causing precipitation of phosphate.
There has been much work on this topic over the years, but an interesting new idea is that meteorites may have introduced reactive phosphorus species on the early earth.

Different forms of life may have appeared quasi-simultaneously in the early history of Earth. The other forms may be extinct, leaving distinctive fossils through their different biochemistry (e.g., using arsenic instead of phosphorus), survive as extremophiles, or simply be unnoticed through their being analogous to organisms of the current life tree. Hartman for example combines a number of theories together, by proposing that:
The first organisms were self-replicating iron-rich clays which fixed carbon dioxide into oxalic and other dicarboxylic acids. This system of replicating clays and their metabolic phenotype then evolved into the sulfide rich region of the hotspring acquiring the ability to fix nitrogen. Finally phosphate was incorporated into the evolving system which allowed the synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids. If biosynthesis recapitulates biopoesis, then the synthesis of amino acids preceded the synthesis of the purine and pyrimidine bases. Furthermore the polymerization of the amino acid thioesters into polypeptides preceded the directed polymerization of amino acid esters by polynucleotides.

Space Invasion

Space Invasion is a text-based online browser game. Space Invasion is a Space-strategy themed game. It currently has over 500,000 Players. Space Invasion was created by the company Bigpoint.

There are 4 types of resources. They are:

Pig Iron is for upgrading buildings and also to help create Metal.

Metal is harder, more resistant and more mouldable than pig iron, and is used mostly for ship construction and better structures. This is the most used substance in the game

Kryptonite is used for almost all types of ships and buildings. It's also used for research.

Spice is a mostly a rare raw material. As a result, it is that much more valuable. Spice provides a good performance in ship drives, in research and also in alloys. Spice even plays a vital role in food production. It is essential for an up-and-coming empire.

In this game you can trade the various resources with the rule of thumb being 6:3:4:1 in the order Pig Iron, Metal, Kryptonite, Spice.

eg. 6k Pig Iron would be traded for 3k Metal, or 4k Kyrptonite, or 1k Spice.

Mining is the first task you start in the game. In order to mine the four resources you must upgrade each mine. Every upgrade increases the amount of resources the mine produces every hour. But every upgrade uses more energy. So accordingly you must also upgrade the Fusion Plant, which produces energy for the mines. 

Every upgrade uses another field. On your first planet there is 230 fields.

This is the second possibility after mining. You can build and upgrade the Development Center which decreases your building times for factories and such. The research lab unlocks different types of research, and decreases research times. The weapons factory is needed for all ships and defenses. With every level the weapons factory decreases production time.

Stromatolite

Stromatolites are special rock-like structures. They usually form in shallow water. 

They are formed by bacteria such as cyanobacteria (commonly known as blue-green algae). There may also be other types of bacteria and single-celled algae. 

The mucus secreted by the bacteria collects grains of sediment, and they are stuck together with calcium carbonate, also from the bacteria. This builds up into the structures seen in certain sea-shore bays. Cyanobacteria use water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight to create their food, and put out oxygen as a by-product. 

The real significance of stromatolites is that they are the earliest fossil evidence of life on Earth. The oldest stromatolites are dated to 3,450 million years ago, during the Archaean eon.

Early cyanobacteria in stromatolites are thought to be largely responsible for increasing the amount of oxygen in the primaeval Earth's atmosphere through their continuing photosynthesis.

Makemake (dwarf planet)

Makemake (officially known as 136472 Makemake) is a dwarf planet. It was discovered on March 31, 2005 by astronomers Michael E. Brown, Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz. It was announced as a dwarf planet on June 11, 2008. Makemake is a Trans-Neptunian object, because it orbits the Sun after Neptune.

It is called Makemake after the god of the ancient civilization that lived on Easter island.

Originally the object was nicknamed 'Easter Bunny' as it was discovered around Easter time. The International Astronomical Union said this wasn't a good name so it was given the name Makemake, the creator god of the Easter Island people to keep its connection to Easter.

Makemake appears to be made mainly of ice and rock. However, at its very low temperature, ice is as hard as many types of rock.

Slash fiction is fiction, especially fanfiction, that is about homosexual couples. Usually "slash" refers to male/male couples. The word "FemSlash" is used to describe female/female couples. To this day, most slash is written by females for females to read.

The word is believed to have first been used with Kirk/Spock pairings in fan stories. These stories began being written in the late 1970's.

Slash fiction does not need explicit sexual encounters to be considered slash. The homosexual activity could be just holding hands or kissing.

In Japanese manga, slash stories are called "yaoi". This is only used to describe male/male relationships. "Yuri" is used to describe female/female relationships, much the same as the word "FemSlash" is used.

Amendment

An amendment is a formal or official change made to a law, contract, constitution, or other legal document. It is based on the verb to amend, which means to change. Amendments can add, remove, or update parts of these agreements. They are often used when it is better to change the document than to write a new one.

Contracts are often amended when the market changes. For example, a contract to deliver something to a customer once a month can be amended if the customer wants it delivered once a week. Usually, everyone involved in the contract must agree to the amendment before it goes into effect. Most contracts are written with rules about amendments, like if they are allowed, who must agree to them, and when they go into effect. 

Constitutions are often amended when people change their minds about what the government should do. Some of the most famous constitutional amendments are the First Amendment to the United States Constitution which added the freedom of speech, religion, press, and protest, and the Third Amendment to the Constitution of Ireland, which let Ireland join the European Union. Constitutional amendments usually must be approved by both the parliament or legislature and a referendum - a vote by all citizens in a country.

In parliamentary procedure, the way that many meetings are run, an amendment is a type of motion - a proposal or formal suggestion to do something. Amendments can remove words, add words, or change words from motions. Usually, any motion can be amended, even other amendments. However, an amendment to an amendment of an amendment is often not allowed.

Precambrian

Pre-cambrian (or Precambrian) is an obsolete term used to describe the eons before the Cambrian. It lasted from about 4.55 billion yeas ago to about 542 million years ago. It starts with the beginning of the Earth, about 4.54 billion years ago. When it ends, there were many hard-shelled animals around. It is named after the Roman name for Cymru / Wales, because rocks thought to be from this time were first studied there.

The tern has been replaced by three terms, the Hadean (4.5 to 3.8 billion years ago), the Archaean (3.8 to 2.5 billion years) and the Proterozoic (from 2.5 billion years to 542 million years).

The immediate Precambrian period is the Ediacaran.

Presidents' Trophy

The Presidents' Trophy is an award presented by the National Hockey League (NHL) to the team that finishes with the most points in the league during the regular season. If two teams tie for the most points, then the trophy goes to the team with the most wins. The winning team is also awarded $350,000 in cash bonuses. The Presidents' Trophy has been awarded 23 times to 13 different teams since first being awarded in 1985. The most recent winner is the Vancouver Canucks for the NHL season.
The trophy was introduced at the start of the 1985–86 NHL season by the league's Board of Governors. Before the 1985–86 NHL season, the best team in the league during the regular season was allowed to hang a banner stating "NHL League Champions". The winning team is also awarded 350,000 Canadian dollars, to be shared between the team and its players. The Presidents' Trophy winner is guaranteed home-ice advantage in all four rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs, provided the team goes that far, so it remains the most likely position to produce the cup winner.

From 1937 to 1968, the same rules now used for winning the Presidents' Trophy were used to award the Prince of Wales Trophy. With the Modern Era expansion in the 1967–68 season and the start of the West Division, the Wales Trophy was awarded to the team that finished in first place in the East Division during the regular season. However, no trophy was awarded to the team that finished with the best overall record in the league during this period, and no trophy at all was awarded from the 1981–82 season through the 1984–85 season; the Wales and Campbell trophies were transferred to the playoff champions of those conferences in 1981–82. A cash bonus was given to each player on the team with the league's best regular-season record during these years, to which the Presidents' Trophy was added in 1985–86.

The only team to have won the Presidents' Trophy more than twice is the Detroit Red Wings, with six. However, the Montreal Canadiens have finished first overall 21 times, the most times in league history, although they have yet to win the Presidents' Trophy. Detroit is second with 18 first-overall finishes.

Prince of Wales Trophy

<onlyinclude>
The Prince of Wales Trophy, or simply the Wales Trophy, is a National Hockey League (NHL) trophy awarded to the Eastern Conference (formerly the Wales Conference) playoff champions. The trophy is awarded prior to the final series which are the championship games to decide the winner for the Stanley Cup against the Western Conference's champions. The trophy was first established in the 1923-24 NHL season, for the champion of the NHL playoffs, but it has been the trophy for eight different accomplishments, which also include being the NHL regular season champions, American Division regular season champions, regular season champions, East Division regular season champions, Wales Conference regular season champions, Wales Conference playoffs champions, and Eastern Conference playoffs champions. The current holder of the Prince of Wales Trophy is the Boston Bruins after defeating the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 2011 Eastern Conference finals. 

The Prince of Wales Trophy was donated by His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII and the Duke of Windsor), in 1924. It was first presented to the playoff champion of the NHL (replacing the O'Brien Trophy) who then went on to face the Western Hockey League (WHL) champion for the Stanley Cup.

After the WHL folded and the Stanley Cup was awarded only to the NHL playoff champion, the Prince of Wales Trophy was awarded to the regular season champion. From 1927–28 onwards it was awarded to the champion of the NHL American Division while the O'Brien Trophy was awarded to the NHL Canadian Division. It was then repurposed to being the trophy for the overall regular season champion in the 1938-39 NHL season when the NHL reverted to a single division.

With the Modern Era expansion in the 1967–68 season and the creation of the West Division, the Wales Trophy was awarded to the team that finished in first place in the East Division during the regular season. When the league formed two conferences in the season of 1974–75, the award was transferred to the team that finished with the best regular-season record in the Wales Conference. Starting with the 1981–82 campaign, when the league changed its playoff format so that the two teams meeting in the Stanley Cup finals could no longer come from the same conference, the trophy was presented to the Wales Conference playoff champions, and since the 1993–94 season, the Eastern Conference playoff champions have won the award.

Once awarded, the deputy commissioner, currently Bill Daly, would present the trophy to the winning team's captain. However, a traditional superstition that is prevalent among many of today's NHL players is that no player should either touch or hoist the Wales Trophy (or the Western Conference's trophy, the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl) when they have won the conference playoffs as the Eastern Conference champions. Players feel that the Stanley Cup is the only true championship trophy and thus it should be the only trophy that should be hoisted.


"Refers to the original Ottawa Senators NHL franchise (1917–1934)."

Pet Sounds

Pet Sounds is the tenth album by the American band, The Beach Boys. The album was released in 1966. 

The album was very popular because it was different from most of the band's other music. Most of The Beach Boys' albums before it had all been about surfing, summer, cars, girls, and fun. They were all quite basic in their music. They were mostly Rock and roll and surf music. "Pet Sounds" was different because of its more complex arrangements;. The bass player for the band, Brian Wilson used a system of recording songs that was different than the system they had used before. In the recording, stringed and wind instruments were used. They also used instruments that were very unusual for rock music. These included vibraphones, harps, French horns, harpsichords, electro-theremins. Also, things like bicycle whistles, and Coca Cola cans with stones inside of them were used. The lyrics of the songs were more serious. They talked about the problems, disappointments and sadness of a young man. Because all the songs had a similar mood and themes, it is considered to be a concept album.

Much of the album was recorded by Wilson himself using professional studio musicians. - people who are hired to play songs for an album. Some of the other band members did not like this. They felt he was ignoring their talents. Mike Love thought that it would be too hard to play these songs live and that their fans would not understand the songs. 

After the album was released, "Pet Sounds" did not sell very well. It reached #10 in the American hit-parade. Wilson felt this was a failure but music critics loved it. The album got real recognition in 1990s-2000s, when many music magazines listed it in their lists of the best albums in popular music (New Musical Express, Rolling Stone, Melody Maker, Mojo Magazine).

Wilson decided to make another album in the same way. The new album, he called "Smile".

Smile (album)

Smile was a Beach Boys album. Their bass player Brian Wilson wanted the album to be the follow-up to the album "Pet Sounds". For some reasons, it was not released for over 30 years.

After seeing the success that "Pet Sounds" had been, Wilson wanted to make an album that was even better. In late 1966, he started work on what he said would be "the greatest rock album ever made." He asked Van Dyke Parks to write words for new songs. 
"SMiLE" was not completed on time for at least three reasons:

When the time came to release the album, Brian said that the album was not finished and would be delayed for an unknown length of time. People still hoped that he would finish it, but in May 1967, the album was cancelled. Wilson had stopped working on it and it would never be finished. 

Later in 1967, The Beach Boys released another album called "Smiley Smile". The album had songs that were written for "Smile". "Smiley Smile" was not the great success that Wilson thought "Smile" would have been. The Beach Boys lost many fans because of the album's failure. The failure also cost Capitol Records much money because not enough people bought the album.

As Carl lamented, they tried for a homerun with "Smile", and ended up hitting a bunt with "Smiley Smile".

In 2004, Brian finished "Smile". The album was a success. People were happy that "SMiLE" could finally be heard as it was meant to be heard.

<doc id="119876" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=119876" title="Greek Salad">
Greek Salad

Greek salad (Greek: "χωριάτικη σαλάτα", ), 'country/village salad', is a dish from Greece. It is commonly served as a part of a traditional Greek meal. It is one of the most popular salads in Greece and Cyprus. This is because it is light, refreshing and easy to make. It is especially popular during the summer months. True Greek salad is essentially a tomato salad made of sliced or chopped tomatoes with a few slices of cucumber, and red onion. It is usually seasoned with salt, black pepper, and oregano and dressed with olive oil. Common additions include feta cheese, bell peppers, capers, anchovies, sardines and kalamata olives. Lettuce and vinegar are not used in a Greek salad. 

A lettuce salad (called μαρούλι, "lettuce") is a different salad. It is also popular, especially in the autumn and spring. It is made of finely sliced lettuce, scallions, and fresh dill, and dressed with salt, black pepper, olive oil and red wine vinegar or lemon juice.

In North America, Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom, "Greek salad" has a different meaning: It is a lettuce salad, with Greek-inspired ingredients. The dressing is usually vinegar and oil. Lettuce, tomatoes, feta, and olives are the most standard elements in an American "Greek" salad, but cucumbers, bell peppers, onions, radishes, dolmades, anchovies/sardines and pickled hot peppers are common. In the Detroit, Michigan area, for example, a "Greek salad" also includes beets. Rather than simple olive oil and vinegar, as in a μαρούλι - lettuce salad, prepared dressings containing various herbs and seasonings are frequently used. This style of "Greek salad" is rarely encountered in Greece except in the homes of American Greeks or restaurants that cater to tourists. In these countries, the true Greek salad, when encountered, may be called by the Greek term horiatiki—pronounced [hɔːriː'ætɪkiː]—or by such terms as "country salad", "peasant salad", or "village salad", to avoid confusion. 

Greek salad is also found in other European countries for example Germany (where it is often called "Bauernsalat", literally "farmers' salad"), France (salade à la Grecque), Hungary (görög saláta) and Spain (ensalada griega).

Various other salads have also been called "Greek" in the English language in the last century. Some of them have a very old connection to Greek cuisine. For example, one 1938 American recipe called for a mayonnaise-dressed lettuce salad with shredded cabbage, carrots, and diced smoked herring (rega/renga).

The salads of Greek cuisine are wide and varied. Each region of Greece has or has had a salad specific to the village or area. The most common, described above, start most meals today in Greece at home or when dining out. Others include:

Some spreads and dips found in the meze of Greek cuisine are also affectionately called 'salad' in Greek. Melitzanosalata (Greek: μελιτζανοσαλάτα), is an eggplant 'puree' that includes olive oil, red wine vinegar, flat-leaf parsley and garlic (with regional variations). Taramosalata (Greek: ταραμοσαλάτα) is fish roe mixed with lemon juice, onions, and olive oil, and breadcrumbs or mashed potato.

Homo habilis

Homo habilis (also known as "handy man") is one of the early ancestors of modern man who used primitive stone tools. Their remains have been found in the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. They are believed to be about 2 million years old. The flat face and large molars of the "Homo habilis" resemble the Australopithecus lineage. The brain size of the "Homo habilis" is about 700 cc (larger than the Australopithecus). An "apelike" (long arms and a small body) body structure was characteristic of the "Homo habilis". They are believed to have been about 1.3 metres tall, and weigh about 37 kilograms. There is still a lot of argument between scientists about the species. They can not all agree on the characteristics, or whether it is even a separate species at all.

<doc id="119906" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=119906" title="Books of Kings">
Books of Kings

The Books of Kings are a set of books in the Old Testament. Both Judaism and Christianity see it as a part of the Bible. The Books of Kings describes the history of Israel's kings from the end of the rule of David until the time of the Babylonian exile (so it writes about a time of about 453 years). After a long description of Solomon's rule, 1,2 Kings writes of how the kingdom of Israel was divided and then shows how the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah developed.

1 and 2 Kings, like 1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and 2 Books of Chronicles) are actually one book. It was simply called "Kings." However, it was divided into two books by the translators of the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament), and so it was written as 1 and 2 Kings by the Latin translation and many other versions.

The division between 1 and 2 Kings was made after the death of Ahab in the northern kingdom (22:37) and Jehoshaphat in the southern kingdom (22:50).

It is not known for sure who is the author (writer) of 1,2 Kings. Jewish tradition says that Jeremiah wrote 1,2 Kings, but people do not usually think so today. Whoever the author was, he knew the book of Deuteronomy, like many of Israel's prophets. He also used lots of sources, like "the books of the annals of Solomon" (11:41, NIV), "the book of the annals of the kings of Israel" (14:19 NIV), and "the book of the annals of the kings of Judah" (14:29 NIV)". Probably other sources were used, like those inside Chronicles).

1,2 Kings gives lots of chronological information. The length of time each king rules is given, and often other information is given, such as the age of the ruler at the time of becoming king.

By putting in Biblical data with those given from Assyrian chronological records, the year 853 B.C. is probable as the year of Ahab's death, and the year 841 as the year Jehu began to reign. So, it can be known that the division of the kingdom happened in 930 B.C., and that Samaria was defeated by the Assyrians in 722-721, and that Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians in 586.

The information about the connection between the reigns of the kigns of Israel and Judah have some problems, which have, for a long time, been wondered at. Recently, though, most of these problems have been solved by recognizing things like possibilities of reigns that overlap, sons ruling "with" their fathers, differences in the time of the year in which the rule of a king officially began, and differences in the way a king's first year was seen.

1,2 Kings does not exactly say its purpose or theme, but it is most probable that the author wanted to write his material as a sequel, the next book after the books of Samuel: a history about the kings by covenant.

The writer was not trying to show a social, or political, or economical history of Israel's kings like most histories today. He writes about Omri, who was a very powerful king and an important political person, in only six verses (16:23-28), simply saying that he "did evil in the eyes of the Lord" (16:25, NIV). Also, Jeroboam the second, who was king over northern Israel when it was most powerful, is written about very shortly (2 Kings 14:23-29).

He also writes nothing about the first years of Josiah king of Judah, but says a long description of how they begin again to keep the covenant in his 18th year as king (2 Kings 22:3-23:28). Nothing is said about why Josiah fought with Pharaoh Neco of Egypt at Megiddo.

The kings who is most written about in the books of Kings are the kings who either kept the covenant well, broke it very badly, or had an important encounter with one of God's prophets. Ahab son of Omri and Manasseh broke the covenant so that it was dangerous to Israel, so the author wrote a lot about them both; Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:1-20:21) and Josiah (2 Kings 22:1 - 23:29) are written a lot about because they tried to remind the people of their covenant promises. They are the only two kings who the writer is really happy with for their loyalty to the Lord.

Another important part of 1 and 2 Kings is that the writer shows the relationship between prophecy and how it is fulfilled (comes true) in history. At least 11 prophecies are written to be true. The writer also shows the importance of the prophets as messengers from God to tell the kings and people of Israel to come back to God. Uusally, nobody listened to their warnings (for example, Ahijah, Shemaiah, Micaiah, Jonah, Isaiah, Huldah), but the writer writes very much about Elijah and Elisha.

Books of the Bible

Books of the Bible are listed differently in the canons of Jews, and Catholic, Protestant, Greek Orthodox, Slavonic Orthodox, Georgian, Armenian Apostolic, Syriac and Ethiopian Churches, although there is substantial overlap. A table comparing the canons of some of these denominations appears below, for both the Old Testament and the New Testament. For a detailed discussion of the differences, see "Biblical canon".

The Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Eastern Catholic churches may have minor differences in their lists of accepted books. The list given here for these churches is the most inclusive: if at least one Eastern church accepts the book, it is included here. The books included by the Roman Catholic Church are universally included in the Eastern canons.

A table cell with an asterisk (*) indicates that a book is present but in a different order. Empty cells indicate that a book is absent from that canon; such books are often called "apocrypha", a term that is sometimes used specifically (and possibly pejoratively) to describe the books in the Catholic and Orthodox canon that are absent from the Protestant Bible; Orthodox and Catholic Christians describe these books as "deuterocanonical", meaning second canon.

In general, among Christian groups the New Testament canon is agreed-upon, although book order can vary.
The Ethiopian Orthodox Church has a few additional books in its canon: Jubilees, Book of Enoch, and the Rest of the Words of Baruch (4 Baruch). 

The Peshitta excludes 2-3 John, 2 Peter, Jude, and Revelation, but Bibles of the modern Syriac Orthodox Church include later translations of those books along with the Letter of Baruch. Still today the official lectionary followed by the Syrian Orthodox Church (with headquarters at Kottayam (Kerala), and the Chaldean Syriac Church, also known as the Church of the East (Nestorian), with headquarters at Trichur (Kerala)) presents lessons from only the twenty-two books of Peshitta, the version to which appeal is made for the settlement of doctrinal questions. 

Third Epistle to the Corinthians was once considered part of the Armenian Orthodox Bible, but is no longer printed with modern editions.

These are the Anglican Apocrypha as defined by the 39 Articles. The Apocrypha Books are ordered according to the Vulgate. The Lutheran Apocrypha is different.

Bambi's Children

Bambi's Children, The Story of a Forest Family () is a book written by Felix Salten, first printed and translated from German to English in 1939. It is a sequel to Salten's book "Bambi, A Life in the Woods". It was first published in German only in the following year.

The main characters are Bambi's twin fawns, Geno, male, and Gurri, female; it also stars their friends, another pair of fawns named Lana and Boso. Lana and Boso are the children of Aunt Rolla, a doe met later in the course of the novel. Two more new characters are introduced—Nello and Membo, the orphans. The overall storyline is how Geno and Gurri learn the pleasures as well as downsides of nature and their forest home. "Bambi, A Life in the Woods", the original story of Bambi, is much darker than the sequel. Unlike its predecessor, "Bambi's Children" ends when Geno begins to grow his antlers, whereas "Bambi, A Life in the Woods" continues until Bambi's children are born. In the end, Faline, knowing the time is right, sends off her children to live their own lives.

What may be interesting to readers is that it is not possible to determine whether "Bambi's Children" is a sequel to the book "Bambi" or a midquel as there are no references to the former which makes one able to place the latter. The language of "Bambi's Children" is more gentle than that of "Bambi, A Life in the Woods".

Fill (music)

A fill in popular music is a short instrumental passage, between melody lines of a song. (A longer passage between verses is called a solo.)

Fills are usually played with a keyboard instrument or a guitar, but other instruments (such as a saxophone) may also be used. Drum fills are sometimes called "drum rolls", but a roll is actually a steady beat on a single drum, while a fill may use more than one drum or beat.

Montevideo Convention

The Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States is a treaty. Today, it is part of customary international law. The treaty was signed at Montevideo, Uruguay, on December 26, 1933, at the Seventh International Conference of American States. At this conference, United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordell Hull declared the so-called Good Neighbor Policy which opposed U.S. armed intervention in inter-American affairs. Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to reverse the perception of "Yankee imperialism" with this treaty. The view of Yankee imperialism was brought about by policies instituted (largely) by his predecessor, President Herbert Hoover. The convention was signed by 19 states, three with reservations (Brazil, Peru and the United States).

The convention is about what is a state and what rights and duties it has. Most well-known is article 1, which sets out the four criteria for statehood that have sometimes been recognized as an accurate statement of customary international law:

In addition, the first sentence of article 3 explicitly states that "The political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states." This is known as the declarative theory of statehood.

Some have questioned whether these criteria are sufficient, as they allow less-recognized entities like the Republic of China (Taiwan) or even entirely non-recognized entities like the Principality of Sealand to claim full status as states. According to the alternative constitutive theory of statehood, a state exists only insofar as it is recognized by other states. It should not be confused with the Estrada doctrine.

There have also been attempts to further broaden the convention's definition, although they have gained less support. Founders of non-territorial micronations commonly assert that the requirement in the Montevideo Convention of a defined territory is in some way wrong-headed, for largely unspecified reasons. Some non-territorial entities, notably the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, are indeed considered subjects of international law, but these do not aspire to statehood.

The states that signed this convention are: Honduras, United States of America, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, Mexico, Panama, Guatemala, Brazil, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Cuba.
The Montevideo Convention only codified existing norms, there is nothing "new" in the convention. For this reason, it does not only apply to those who signed it, but to all subjects of international law as a whole.

The European Union, in the principal statement of its Badinter Committee, follows the Montevideo Convention in its definition of a state: by having a territory, a population, and a political authority. The committee also found that the existence of states was a question of fact, while the recognition by other states was purely declaratory and not a determinative factor of statehood. 

Switzerland, although not a member of the European Union, adheres to the same principle, stating that "neither a political unit needs to be recognized to become a state, nor does a state have the obligation to recognize another one. At the same time, neither recognition is enough to create a state, nor does its absence abolish it."

Folly

In architecture, a folly is a building usually constructed strictly for aesthetic pleasure. Originally, buildings were made to provide shelter or to house people. Follies are just decoration; they no longer have a building's original function.
They were first constructed to put accents into parks and estates. "Folly" is used in the sense of fun or light-heartedness, not in the sense of something ill-advised.

In general, follies have the following properties:


In England, these structures are also called "eye-catchers". This points to their basically decorative nature.

Follies fall within the general realm of fanciful and impractical architecture, and whether a particular structure is a folly is sometimes a matter of opinion. However, there are several types which are related but which can be distinguished from follies.






Follies began as decorative accents on the great estates of the late 16th and early 17th centuries but they flourished especially in the two centuries which followed. Many estates were blessed with picturesque ruins of monastic houses and (in Italy) Roman villas; others, lacking such buildings, constructed their own sham versions of these romantic structures. Such structures were often dubbed "[name of architect or builder]'s Folly", after the single individual who commissioned or designed the project. However, very few follies are completely without a practical purpose. Apart from their decorative aspect, many originally had a use which was lost later, such as hunting towers. Follies are misunderstood structures, according to The Folly Fellowship, a charity that exists to celebrate the history and splendour of these often neglected buildings.

Follies are often found in parks or large grounds of houses and stately homes. Some were deliberately built to look partially ruined. They were especially popular from the end of the 16th century to the 18th century. Theme parks and world's fairs have often contained "follies", although such structures do serve a purpose of attracting people to those parks and fairs.

The Irish Potato Famine of 1845-49 led to the building of several follies. The society of the day held that laissez faire, not a welfare state, was the appropriate form of civil management. The concept of a welfare state was a century away, and at that time reward without labour, even to those in need, was seen as misguided. However, to hire the needy for work on useful projects would deprive existing workers of their jobs. Thus, construction projects termed "famine follies" came to be built. These include: roads in the middle of nowhere, between two seemingly random points; screen and estate walls; piers in the middle of bogs; etc.

Follies can be found worldwide, but there seem to be many in Great Britain.

Littlest Pet Shop

Littlest Pet Shop are a line of toys sold by Hasbro. They are marketed for girls. The toys were first sold in 1992. They were sold for four years before Hasbro stopped selling them. In 2005, the company started selling them again. Since 2005, over 60 million of the toys have been sold at about $4 each. The "Littlest Pet Shop" toys are one of the main types of toys sold by Hasbro.

Each toy is a one inch statue of an animal. Most of these animals are commonly found in pet stores. For example, puppies, kittens, turtles and hamsters. They also sell other types of animal toys, for example horses, penguins and even skunks. There are many different types of each animal. The company has made more than 300 different versions of the animals. It changes the ones it sells every few months.

A Littlest Pet shop (also LPS) is a little toy. There are cats, dogs, birds, pigs, mice, and also snails. There are also playsets. Here are some playsets. Jungle playplace: comes with a steak, a tiger, playhouse, and a monkey.

The company has a website that can be used by people who buy the toys. This website lets the user create pets and play games. In 1995, an animated television series was bade based on the toys. 

At E3 in July 2008, Electronic Arts said it was making a video game based on "Littlest Pet Shop". The game is being made for the Nintendo DS, Wii, and the PC. The game should be sold near the end of 2008.

Just a heads up that PIO, who is banned from editing Wikipedia has come over here as , and has been pretty active today after the blocking yesterday of his latest two socks from the English Wiki. It's simple ban evasion, as, without regard for the tenets of the Simple Wiki, he has been copy-pasting his favourite articles from English Wikipedia, such as Istrian-Dalmatian exodus, on English Wiki as Istrian exodus . I'd also point out a problem with copyvios, such as Dalmatia, a copyvio from here and here . Sorry if I'm dragging issues over here from the English Wiki, but I thought you should know. () 18:22, 17 June 2008 (UTC)

I consider Alasdairgreen27 a sockpuppet on English wiki and in violation for vandalism, incivility, canvassing, harassment, POV, edit warring, disruption, stalking and personal attack against me. Yesterday Alasdairgreen27 like as a strange child logged here only for personal attacks against me. Luigi and Ciolone are not PIO socks and Luigi is valid editor in Italian wiki: nobody suspect him as a sock! I am editor in Spanish and French wiki too. I elected MBisanz as admin in English wiki but he insulted me. You all consider this: in my user page I linked a calendar of Italian soldiers. Best wishes,-- () 12:36, 18 June 2008 (UTC)

This word, "birefringence" appears under the "b" section on the simple english word list. Others have commented on the talk page about it. Should it be removed or am I missing something?? () 09:27, 19 June 2008 (UTC)

Please fix the redirect for , it is very annoying because it has been the only double redirect for a while now and is protected. Thanks -- 23:11, 29 June 2008 (UTC)

There has been an increase of copyright violations from new pages, so please remember to check them, thanks 00:23, 30 June 2008 (UTC)

Two days ago, a user was replacing pages with "1709" again. Thinking that it was the 1709 vandal again, I soft-blocked the IP range for a week (refer to the post on top). Please keep a lookout for this vandal after his block expires.     12:21, 30 June 2008 (UTC)

This user has been extremely abusive. He first started by redirecting a user talk page to the article Penis, which I reverted and gave a level-two warning for (page since deleted). He then lifted RyanCross's userpage and tried to pass it off as his own He changed the last part of my name to "Gay" and spoke something in Finnish which I have roughtly translated to "Hello the whore mua does not interest sun, a shit" He then proceeded to call me a "a pussy ämmä stuff a slut in the ass, sun," again in Finnish after I warned him for trying to impersonate RyanCross. In another deleted edit, he asked me to give fellatio to him. This is very upsetting, but it's not the easy kind of VIP report, so I'm bringing it here. 03:57, 7 July 2008 (UTC)

Grateful thanks to both of you for solving this problem. 05:41, 7 July 2008 (UTC)

I've been noticing off and on that there's a vandal that will always hopefully tell us when he/she is vandalizing with an edit summary that says "Removing all content from page." Is thia annoying? Is this being done by one person only? They seem to be changing their IP addresses; the last one, by , is the user's only edit. Would a CU or rangeblock be out of the question? 01:36, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

Hi. As SUL is now enabled, please do the following:

Hi,

I just noticed that this page has been a bit vandalised. 

I'm not sure if I'd do more harm than good trying to fix it, so I thought it might be best to post here to let someone know.

cheers! 

Hello. Could an administrator all my deleted contributions? I just wanted to see how my QD tags are doing. Thanks, () 07:35, 12 July 2008 (UTC)

Mine too plese () -- 20:57, 13 July 2008 (UTC)

For anyone who just witnessed an Avril Lavigne message popping up and not going away on a number of pages, this is your explanation. I tracked it down to the template being vandalised. I've repaired the damage, just thought you should all know in case it happens again. I'm tempted now to identify all templates which have a number of transclusions and fully protecting them. Thoughts would be appreciated. () 10:45, 15 July 2008 (UTC)
This isn't the only place its happened. I have been trying to track down the other one. It's showing up on some hockey pages, I think its coming from somewhere in the navbox template. - () 14:18, 15 July 2008 (UTC)

I'm not sure why we don't follow English Wikipedia's example of protecting our most heavily used templates (e.g. , etc. The Avril Lavigne episode (above) shows how destructive a single edit can be and it can take time to track it down during which all pages using such will have, effectively, whatever the vandal wants on display all the time. Anyone against at least semi-protecting the major templates? () 14:42, 15 July 2008 (UTC)

I have created . 14:58, 15 July 2008 (UTC)

We really need to do something about this. This IP has created a million pages, just trying to add to his creations is a nightmare. I've noticed many NPOV problems with his changes. Many of his pages have cluttered . He been kindly given tips - which have been mostly ignored. I can no longer keep up with the trail of messes that have been started. Thoughts? -- AmericanEagle (talk) 19:49, 16 July 2008 (UTC)
I have gone through and tagged roughly 150 of this users articles with <nowiki> and </nowiki>, but I am starting to wonder if a lot of them (like this and many others like it) should just be deleted. This user has created countless articles since being told multiple times to, at the very least, put a stub notice on the page. As AE said above, just doing that is a nightmare. This user is clearly not interested in following the rules. Anyone else think a short block might fix that? -- () 01:03, 17 July 2008 (UTC)
I could go on but it really is a pain goung through all his/her edits. Im sorry, but I fail to see where is the witch hunt. The English wikipedia does not differentiante between India and Republic of India. The term British raj means "Britis rule" not "British India"(British india is the preffered term to refer to colonial India since India referes to a geo-political entity that is 5000 years old. When people say India it could be at any point of time. -- () 12:18, 17 July 2008 (UTC)

Hello. Administrators, I think the article water should be protected from editing by anons. It seems it has a good record of vandalism recently. Maybe a protection for a week or two would be good? If an administrator thinks no protection is needed, then I'll go with that. Thanks, () 23:53, 16 July 2008 (UTC)
The only recent IP vandalism was on July 15 and June 30. You have to go back to April for the next prior occurrence. Just block the IPs. Page protection is rarely needed. - 15:09, 17 July 2008 (UTC)

Could an admin please change this message to "article" as per . Thanks. — 10:27, 18 July 2008 (UTC)

Just a quickie to say that American Eagle needs adding. 16:08, 18 July 2008 (UTC)

I think should be indefinitely protected. It was previously, but only for a month. As it's used on each of the , I think it would be unacceptable legally for simple: if it was vandalised.

Although I really think full protection is called for, I'd support semi-protection if that's what others want. After all, each Disclaimer page is only semi-protected, and so the template could be removed from them by a vandal. My reason for suggesting full protection is that is just a header and so will need few edits; in addition, it contains the vital legal message that it's then en: version of the disclaimers that's binding.

I am also requesting indefinite semi-protection for:

Again, for the reason that it would put simple English Wikipedia in unacceptable legal danger if they were vandalised. On en:, all of them are fully protected (although I wouldn't support this on simple: as they don't use fully simple language yet and need improvement).

Thanks,

I don't pretend to set a RfA self-nomination record ;-))) but I could have some regrets if still nobody answers my recurrent question about .

I'm posting here and not on the "Village pump" alias because only Admins can be kind to check them and tell me if they are organized same way other wikis and (main point) if they are frequently updated.

Hello all,

If some of you are aware, a common template, which some may have seen before:

"This article or parts of it were created based, in whole or in part, on this version of the English Wikipedia article. The complete history of the article can be found there. "

, is used to tell people if an article is based on the EN Wikipedia version of the article. I believe that many do not use this template, and it should be due to the fact that it is troublesome. If possible, may I propose that a standard template be created to facilitate this, and promote the use of it? () 13:53, 6 July 2008 (UTC)

I would like to bring to your attention that when "Main Page" is typed in the search box, it will lead you to the Main Page of this Wiki. It will be misleading if a user wants to get information on Main Pages, and is sent back to where he was at first. There is currently a article on Home Page. Ought it be redirected to that page? I'm not sure, what do you think? () 15:16, 6 July 2008 (UTC)

Hello all,

with Saare Jahan se Achcha we have a poem that has Urdu text in it; I don't know howe this is rendered by brwosers, but what about a page similar to To Read in Malayam (on Malaam Wikipedia)? - I don't know how the browsers handle Urdu though, Urdu is not malayam; it also looks different from the regular indic scrpt (hindi?) -- () 20:52, 6 July 2008 (UTC)

I think there should be a stub for video games. While pretty much every video game article save for a small handful are stubs, once many articles start to get expanded, it'll be useful to be able to find what are still stubs. - () 00:58, 7 July 2008 (UTC)

I've counted more than 3000 articles that transclude . I think perhaps maybe it is time to start breaking them down, starting with video games. 01:25, 7 July 2008 (UTC)

(unindenting) Hiyas alll. The stub problem again. Hiding the problem does not make it smaller. Suppose we had 5 different categories of stubs, with 600 articles each? - It is all the same. I think, our current stubs can be classified as follows:
Rather than coming up with stub-categories, we should look what the nature of a stub is. Once we know that we can then see that most of these 3000 articles do not require the stub tag (or we could have a "stub drive", focused at getting articles to a state where they no longer need the tag. Of course, just my 2 cents. -- () 22:29, 7 July 2008 (UTC)

I only see this around here. You mean there are individual stub templates? () 09:07, 18 July 2008 (UTC)

This is getting rather annoying. I've been copy/pasting templates from the English Wikipedia intact, but somehow they are all messed up (see for what I mean). Do we have a different Infobox template here or something? And can it be fixed, or are we stuck with it? Thanks -- 05:22, 7 July 2008 (UTC)

Hello everyone. A sensitive subject, I've expanded American Airlines Flight 11 up to a point where I consider it meets the criteria. I hope you'll all work with me to get it promoted. () 21:00, 7 July 2008 (UTC)

Hello all! This is Razorflame and I am just going to write a few thoughts that I have had about myself and my editing over the past few weeks:

I know that almost everyone here has noticed how infrequently I have been editing on the Simple English Wikipedia as of late, and this should help to explain why I haven't been editing here as much as I have in the past. There are several reasons why I am not editing as much as I have in the past and they are:

1. To tell you the truth, I feel like there have been so many good editors that have joined this site recently and I feel like they have been taking over many of the roles that I have been doing for the past few months. Therefore, I feel like I am not as useful as I have been in the past. Because of the influx of new users that have been editing this site frequently, I feel as if there is less work for me to do on here and I feel less likely to edit here.

2. To tell you the truth, I have lost motivation to edit here because of a certain email that a certain user has sent to me during my previous RfA and because of the fact that I am feeling like I can never have a successful RfA. It is really making me feel bad and I wish that there was something that I could do for this Wikipedia and make it so that I can have a successful RfA in the future as well.

3. There has not been much vandalism recently. Because of the low amount of vandalism and vandalism reversions, I feel like there is not much reason for me to edit here because that was one of the main reasons why I was editing here in the first place.

4. The long Wikibreak really took me out of the role of knowing what is going on on this Wikipedia and it has really made me think about if I want to continue editing here in the future or if I should just quietly slip off into the sunset.

5. The final reason why I haven't been editing here as much is because I have been extremely active over on Yahoo Answers. In fact, that is where I spend most of my time on the computer now-a-days when I am on the computer. I am trying to come back over here to edit more, but it has been hard.

Hope this clears some things up! Cheers, 22:20, 7 July 2008 (UTC)

1) Don't go; 2) - but it probably wasn't me, as I don't do much, do I? 09:50, Tuesday, July 8 2008 Utc

As we have a small userbase, would it be worth creating , , , , etc? I use the watchlist notifier, and have to manually type in the userpages manually into the search bar, which takes time. 09:54, Tuesday, July 8 2008 Utc
Do we really need to create the UT namespace? We could just have or something like that, or (I would be ), similar to how we have for our leader Jimbo Wales over on the English Wikipedia. 18:18, 8 July 2008 (UTC)

Fllowing the discussion (on Video game stub templates), I propose to start the discussion on what a stub actually is.
I propose the following "features" for a stub

Or look at some examples (picked more or less at random)

The following (taken from the short pages list) are also stubs:

I also propose the following (vague) concept:
"Articles that give a broad overview of the subject are not stubs". In that classification "Graph theory" should not be a stub; it is also no lnoger easy to expand it (in other words: it requires some knowledge on graph theory to do so). 

What do you think? -- () 10:38, 8 July 2008 (UTC)

Hello all,
subjects like slavery are commonly taught in schools (In different contexts, probably with the false info that it no longer exists, but that is something else). I therefore believe that articles like slavery should increase our visibliity very much (ideally, slavery should be a well-balanced VGA, but we are very far from that). It woulsd therefore be a good thing if we could focus our efforts on such articles - it might sipmly pay off... ;) -- () 13:30, 8 July 2008 (UTC)
That's actually not what I intended to say. To rephrase: "Some subjects are commonly taught at school. Having a decent aricle for the subject in question might increase our visibilty. It would therefore be a good idea to see that such subjects are well-covered." -I only took slavery as an example because I discovered it (see stub discussion above). -- () 13:58, 8 July 2008 (UTC)

Ok, I do not have the time to create a formal description of the Wikiproject, to find a name, etc. But informally, I see it as follows:
Extend the articles listed on the so that:
There is therefore no need to join anything at the moment. Hopefully the list contains something for everyone. Use the definition I gave, to see if an article is a stub; the stub tag may be missing, it may also be on articles that do no meet the definition above. -- () 10:19, 9 July 2008 (UTC)

Hurrah, well done everyone. Today saw the promotion of Gothic architecture to status and Daniela Hantuchová‎ to status. Together with Charles Spurgeon and Ana Ivanović, it means Simple English Wikipedia has seen four article promotions in the last month. That's four out of a total of 30 either Good or Very Good Articles. Brilliant. 

However, let's not stop there. We currently have Powderfinger and Baseball uniform at and American Airlines Flight 11 & Anna Kournikova at . Keep up the good work and we may be celebrating four more promotions before the end of July! () 13:59, 8 July 2008 (UTC)

<-- Wait, but how will you decide if you've contributed significantly to an article or not? -- () 21:48, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

Hello all, I am writing here. Those interested should also read the "Viideo game stub" section above.What we have found so far:
Do you all think that having 5 categories (for example of stubs) with roughly 4.000 articles each is better than the current situation. Put differently: I am interested in sports. Does it help me if I have 4.000 articles (vaguely related to sports), rather than 21.000 general ones? - Will anyone ever look past the first few hundred articles? - In that sense, does it make sense to have a more specific stub template, with perhaps laso a category (Sports-related stubs)? -- () 11:01, 9 July 2008 (UTC)

Hi, I have the feeling that the pages created by 92.2.101.184 are not entirely NPOV. I am not familiar with the Pakistan/India politics but it seems to me all or most of these are started from a Pakistan point of view. Can someone have a look at this please? () 06:32, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

Hello all, or again starts to show sings of becoming a name directory (eg. Naomi, Joseph (name), Colm; Khayyam and Stephen are red-link collections). This has already been discussed (It was about Nicholas; see . My personal opinion is still that SimpleWP is not a name directory, giving the meaning and origin of a name. Nicholas has basically not been touched in the last year (in other words, since that deletion discussion linked to above). Since the commuunity has changed somewhat since then, I just wanted to bring it up here (note:This is not an RFD; I don't want votes to keep or to delete the respective articles; I am loonking for opinons. I am also not quick-deleting; since I want opinions). What does the community think, do we want articles that describe where a name is from, and what it means? -- () 12:20, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

 Still on Simple talk

I am on Wikibreak as I have suffered burns - see my user page. -- 10:39, 11 July 2008 (UTC)

True to my metapedian roots, I have now refactored the system completely. Now, all you need do is add <nowiki></nowiki> to your proposed article, and follow the prompts.

Pete Seeger

Pete Seeger (born May 3, 1919 in Patterson, New York) is an American folk musician and songwriter. He was a longtime friend of Woody Guthrie, and founder of The Almanac Singers and The Weavers, two famous folk bands. Seeger's usual musical instrument is a banjo.

Seeger's original songs include "Where Have All The Flowers Gone?", "The Hammer Song" (also called "If I Had A Hammer"), and "Turn, Turn, Turn", whose words were adapted from Ecclesiastes in the Bible. Other musicians played and recorded his songs, including Judy Collins, Peter, Paul and Mary, and The Byrds. Seeger started "Broadside", a magazine devoted to folk music, and also "Sing Out!" to promote music and singing by the public.

Seeger attended Harvard University, but left after he began spending more time working on than school. He organized or played at many benefit concerts, to help people who had been hurt by bad business practices or governmental policies, or sometimes by disasters. He also wrote songs to promote the things he believed in, and to protest things he opposed.

Seeger was a liberal, not afraid to speak his views openly, or to support unpopular causes such as Communism. Seeger's musical career was sometimes limited by his views. The American Federal Bureau of Investigation kept a on Seeger, and the House Un-American Activities Committee put pressure on him, because of his beliefs. He refused to change his views, or to stop doing what he believed was right. Because of this, Seeger was in many places, and could not play music there. He was also not allowed to appear on television for most of the 1950s and 1960s. One rare appearance, on the "Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour", was because the song he played, "Waist Deep In The Big Muddy", was an allegory against the Vietnam War, which most Americans supported at the time.

As years went by, social trends changed in America, and Seeger's views became more acceptable. He was finally able to make television appearances, and was admired for his to folk music, and to causes. He played music together with Arlo Guthrie, the son of Woody Guthrie, performing Woody's old songs and others. He received awards for his music, including the American National Medal for the Arts, and a Kennedy Center Honor. He was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and even the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as an influence to rock musicians.

Seeger is still active, both as a musician and as a for important matters, like the environment, , and people who need a to support them.

Strawberry Fields Forever

"Strawberry Fields Forever" is a song composed by John Lennon, recorded by his band The Beatles in 1966 at Abbey Road Studios, and issued by Parlophone Records and Capitol Records in February 1967, as the to "Penny Lane".

Lennon began work on "Strawberry Fields Forever" while he was in Almería, Spain, during the time he was appearing in a Dick Lester comedy movie, "How I Won the War", which starred Michael Crawford. The lyrics drew on Lennon's memories of Strawberry Field, a Salvation Army home in Liverpool, England, where Lennon went as a boy to with neighborhood friends. "We "always" had fun at Strawberry Fields", he later told Playboy Magazine. They also drew on his feelings of and being different. "No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low" he explained as not being able to find other people who looked at life the way he did.

Lennon's first demo of "Strawberry Fields Forever" was made with a simple tape recorder, by Lennon himself. He explored different of instruments, with the Beatles and George Martin in the recording studio, as they began for "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band". 

One recorded version of the song used a slide guitar. Another used a Mellotron, and was considered a finished work. Lennon wanted to try another arrangement, though, and asked Martin to compose a score for brass instruments, for another session. This was also considered finished.

Lennon could not decide which of the two finished versions of the song was best. He liked how the first one began, but preferred the ending of the second, and asked George Martin if they could be edited together. Martin did not see an easy way to do that, because the key and tempo of each version was different.

It turned out that studio technology made it possible to join the two versions in an effective way. The first version was speeded up on tape, raising its pitch and tempo, and the second slowed down, lowering its pitch and tempo. With edits between verses, Martin changed from one version to the other. Most listeners never noticed the change, or knew about the edit.

To go with the recording, the Beatles filmed a "promo"; an early kind of music video, in January 1967. The band had begun to grow mustaches, and Lennon began to wear eyeglasses in public, which he rarely did before. The changes made the Beatles look very different from how the public saw them earlier. The kind of glasses Lennon wore (sometimes called ""), were issued in England by the and the military, and he wore them making "How I Won the War". Lennon disliked the style as a boy, but now made it a by it.

The Beatles planned to issue "Strawberry Fields Forever" and "Penny Lane" as part of their next album, but EMI asked for a single at the beginning of 1967. The two songs were issued as a single, with "Penny Lane" as the A-side. While "Penny Lane" only reached Number Two in the British record sales chart, it reached Number One in the United States chart. (It was displaced after one week at Number One, by The Turtles, with "Happy Together".) "Strawberry Fields Forever" charted at Number Eight in the US.

It is sometimes believed that "Strawberry Fields Forever" describes or suggests the use of drugs, like LSD or even heroin. Lennon admitted that using LSD and other drugs influenced his songwriting, but made no references to any drug, or drug use, in the song.

In the years after Lennon's death, his cowriter and fellow Beatle Paul McCartney sometimes performed "Strawberry Fields Forever" during concerts. A section of Central Park in New York City, where Lennon lived after the Beatles disbanded, was named "Strawberry Fields" in Lennon's honour.

Dumbo (character)

Dumbo is a fictional anthropomorphic elephant who has huge ears and is able to fly using his magic feather in both the 1939 book of the same name which was written by Helen Aberson and illustrated by Harold Perl, and the Disney movie, which was an adaption of this book.

Much like Dopey in "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", Dumbo has no spoken dialogue. However, in the live-action/puppet television series "Dumbo's Circus", Dumbo was voiced by Katie Leigh.

In the movie, Dumbo is delivered by Mr. Stork, and is made fun of for the strange size of his ears. As his mother, Mrs. Jumbo, beats up the bullies who pick on her baby, the ringmaster has his helpers chain her up and lock her up in a trailer, which says: "MAD ELEPHANT". It is then that Timothy Q. Mouse looks after Dumbo. The two of them try to make Dumbo famous and get his mother free. Thanks to the help of a "magic feather" from some Crows, Dumbo flies to fame, and gets his mother free.

Dumbo the Flying Elephant is also a carousel in Walt Disney world.

<doc id="120040" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=120040" title="Italian Mare Nostrum">
Italian Mare Nostrum

Italian Mare Nostrum was the name given during World War II, by Benito Mussolini and his fascist propaganda to the Mediterranean Sea, under the domination of the Kingdom of Italy.

The Mediterranean was called "Mare Nostrum" (Latin for "Our Sea") during the centuries of the Roman Empire, an empire that Fascism intended to recreate after the conquest of Ethiopia in 1936.

Mussolini wanted to re-establish the greatness of the Roman Empire and believed that Italy was the most powerful of the Mediterranean countries after World War I. He declared that "the twentieth century will be a century of Italian power" and created one of the most powerful navies of the world in order to control the Mediterranean Sea.

However, the nation that really dominated the Mediterranean in 1940 was the United Kingdom, as the British had strong naval bases in Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus. The British also controlled the Suez Canal, along with the French; the "French Third Republic" had a relatively powerful navy, and controlled the African Maghreb. Only after the conquest of Greece and Yugoslavia, in April 1941, Mussolini started to talk about an Italian dominated Mediterranean sea.

In 1942 Mussolini dreamed to create a "Greater Italia" in his "Mare Nostrum" and promoted the fascist project -to be realized in a future peace conference after the expected Axis victory- of an enlarged "Italian Empire", stretching from the Mediterranean shores of Egypt to the Indian Ocean shores of Somalia and eastern Kenya. All these projects disappeared with the final Italian defeat of September 1943.

Italy controlled (directly or indirectly) the seashores of these Mediterranean countries, when Mussolini spoke and boasted of an "Italian Mare Nostrum" in 1941/1942/1943:

When France collapsed in 1940, Mussolini started to expand the Italian maritime control on the central Mediterranean, attacking British possessions. The ensuing "Battle of the Mediterranean" had many changes of fortune and finished with the victory of the Allies.

There were a series of surface actions (e.g., Battle of Cape Matapan, Battle of Punta Stilo, Battle of Cape Teulada, Second Battle of Sirte, Battle of Mid-June, Battle of Mid-August ) between Allied navies and the Italian Regia Marina, during which the British, able to replace losses with warships redeployed from other theatres, finally gained the upper hand. 

The "Battle of Taranto" in 1940 was a successful air attack on the Italian Navy at anchor when 21 British torpedo bombers sunk one battleship and damaged two others.The Italian Navy slowly recovered from that attack, later copied by the Japanese in Pearl Harbour.

The Italian Navy's most successful attack, however, was when human torpedo divers planted mines on British battleships in Alexandria (Egypt) harbour (19 December 1941), and the HMS "Queen Elizabeth" and HMS "Valiant" were sunk . After these sinkings (and the contemporary destruction of the British "Force K"), the Italian Navy obtained for some months the nearly complete control of the central Mediterranean. In this way the Regia Marina was able to deliver the military supply and oil for the "Axis" victory of Tobruk and for the advance toward El Alamein in Egypt.

The Italian Regia Aeronautica entered the war with 3296 airplanes (1332 Bombers and 1160 "Caccia", as were called the Fighters in Italian) distributed in all the "Italian Empire", but only 1796 were in perfect fighting conditions. Most were old "wood" models, and could not match the British aircraft in 1940. 

But in April 1941, when Italy started together with the Germans the coordinated "Axis" attack in the Mediterranean (in the Balkans and in Libya), the Italian Air Force had the new and competitive "Macchi C.202", able to fight successfully the British Spitfires. These airplanes (with the new "Reggiane Re.2002") took control of the Malta and Libyan airspace (together with the German military aircraft) during the successful campaign of General Rommel in Tobruk. 

Only at the beginning of 1943 appeared the modern "Macchi C.205" and "Reggiane Re.2005", but they could not match the overwhelming superiority of the American Air Force.

One of the most renown and important branches of the Regia Aeronautica was the "torpedo bomber" group. In 1941 and 1942, Italian pilots, mostly flying the three-engined, medium bomber "Savoia-Marchetti SM.79" "Sparviero" , inflicted considerable losses to Allied shipping in the Mediterranean Sea.

The only four engine heavy bomber of the Regia Aeronautica was the "Piaggio P.108" B. In the 274th Long-Range Bombardment group these bombers made many long range bombardments of Gibraltar from Sardinia in summer 1942 and reinforced in this way the Regia Aeronautica supremacy during those of months in the Italian Mare Nostrum.

The Italian Army ("Regio Esercito") entered the war with 73 divisions (and one fascist Legion of "Blackshirts"), but only 19 were fully operational for combat in June 1940. Italy during the first years of WWII had only small and medium tanks ("Fiat M13/40" and "Fiat M15/42"), that were no match for the Allies tanks. Only in summer 1943 the Italians developed a heavy tank (the "P40 tank") , but just 5 were ready for combat when Italy signed the armistice. The Italian Army had good antitanks (like the "Semovente 75/18") and reliable armoured cars (like the "AB 41") .

Slowly the initial Italian setbacks (suffered mainly in the African colonies) were corrected with German help and in spring 1941 the Italians started an offensive in the Balkans (Greece and Yugoslavia) and in North Africa (Libya).

In summer/autumn 1942 Italy controlled the European seashores of the Mediterranean from the Rhone river in occupied France to Mount Olympus in Aegean Greece. A similar situation happened in the African shores of the Mediterranean Sea, where Mussolini's control went from Tunisia to El Alamein in Egypt. This Italian domination was increased by the fact that most of the remaining shores of the Mediterranean were controlled by the fascist Spain of General Franco, the France of "Vichy" and the Turkey of Kemal Ataturk, all of them with friendliness toward Mussolini.

In those months Mussolini referred to the Mediterranean Sea as "Mare Nostrum", in the same manner as the Romans had done when they dominated the Classical World. However, the Roman Mare Nostrum lasted for roughly six hundred years, while Mussolini's Mare Nostrum lasted a few years until the Italian armistice in September 1943.

All the overseas possessions of Italy in the Mediterranean Sea (Dodecanese, Libya, Saseno island, etc.) were lost formally as a result of the Treaty of peace with Italy (1947).

When Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940, the Italian Royal Navy ("Regia Marina") was the fourth largest navy in the world. The Italian Navy had a mix of modernised and new battleships and challenged the Allies, mostly the British Royal Navy, for supremacy of the Mediterranean Sea. 

Air support was provided by the Italian Air Force Auxiliary to the Navy ("Aviazione Ausiliara per la Marina"), the naval air service during wartime. The Air Force Auxiliary was in charge of all land-based aircraft, shore-based hydroplanes amongst of vessel-based aircraft, and hydroplanes of Italian Navy.

Italian warships had a general reputation as well-designed and good-looking. But some Italian cruiser classes were rather deficient in armour. All Italian warships lacked radar for most of the war, although the lack of radar was partly offset by the fact that Italian warships were equipped with good "rangefinder" and "fire-control" systems. In addition, whereas Allied commanders at sea had discretion on how to act, Italian commanders were closely and precisely governed by Italian Naval Headquarters ("Supermarina"). This could lead to action being avoided when the Italians had a clear advantage (e.g., During "Operation Hats" . Italian Naval Headquarters was conscious that the British could replace ships lost in the Mediterranean, whereas Italian Navy resources were limited). 

The Allies had "Ultra" intercepts, which predicted the Italian movements, and radar, which enabled them to locate the ships and range their weapons at distance and at night. The better air reconnaissance skills of the "Fleet Air Arm" and their close collaboration with surface units were other major causes of the initial Italian defeats (like in the "Battle of Cape Matapan").

The most successful attack performed by the Italian Navy involved divers planting mines on British battleships in Alexandria harbour (19 December 1941): HMS "Queen Elizabeth" and HMS "Valiant" were sunk in shallow water by the "maiali" of Luigi Durand De La Penne. 
On the same night, "Force K", comprising three cruisers and four destroyers based at Malta, became stranded in an Italian minefield off Tripoli. A cruiser (HMS "Neptune") and a destroyer (HMS "Kandahar") were lost, three other ships were seriously damaged, and more than 900 men died. "Force K" was put out of action and Malta's offensive capabilities were reduced to a minimum.

This sudden series of Allied defeats allowed the Regia Marina to achieve naval supremacy in the central Mediterranean, her supply routes were almost untouched by the enemy for several months. This is the beginning of nearly one year in which the Mediterranean sea was effectively an "Italian Mare Nostrum".
The Italian fleet also took advantage of the situation and moved onto the offensive, blocking or decimating at least three large Allied convoys bound for Malta. This led to a number of naval engagements, such as the "Second Battle of Sirte", the "Battle of Mid-June" or Operation "Harpoon" (plus Operation "Vigorous") and finally to Operation "Pedestal", all of them favourable to the Axis but sufficient supplies had been delviered to Malta for it to survive as a British base. The biggest success of the Italian Fleet was the aerial and surface attack on the "Harpoon" convoy, which sank several Allied warships and damaged others. Only two transports of the original six reached Malta. This was the only undisputed squadron-size victory for Italian surface forces in World War II. 

During these months the Regia Marina even planned an attack to New York harbour for December 1942, but it was delayed for many reasons and was never done .

However, this was only a brief happy time for Mussolini. The oil and supplies brought to Malta, despite heavy losses, by "Operation Pedestal" in August and the Allied landings in North Africa, "Operation Torch", in November 1942, turned the fortunes of war against Italy. After years of stalemate, the Axis forces were ejected from Libya and Tunisia in six months after the "Battle of El Alamein", while their supply lines were harassed day after day by the growing and overwhelming aerial and naval supremacy of the Allies in what has just been the Mussolini's "Italian Mare Nostrum".

The Regia Marina performed well and bravely in its North African convoy duties, but remained at a technical disadvantage. The Italian ships relied on a speed advantage, but could easily be damaged by shell or torpedo, due to their relatively thin armour. The fatal and final blow to the Italian Navy was a shortage of fuel, which forced her main units to remain at anchor for most of the last year of the Italian alliance with Germany .

From summer/fall 1941 to November 1942 the Mediterranean sea was effectively an "Italian Mare Nostrum". These were the main battles/events in those months:

Live Free or Die Hard

Live Free or Die Hard (also called Die Hard 4.0 outside of North America) is an action movie starring Bruce Willis and Justin Long.

The movie starts with John McClane trying to talk to his daughter Lucy. He pulls her boyfriend out of the car. An angry Lucy goes up to her apartment. Afterwards, the police call McClane and ask him to pick up a kid named Matt Farrell. However, when McClane goes down there, mercenaries attack the two. McClane manages to fight them off and gets Farrell into the car.

Day breaks in Washington D.C. The villain, Thomas Gabriel, launches his plan. He takes control over all of the things that help run the country, like traffic lights and transportation systems. He shuts down the FBI building and calls in an anthrax alert. He makes the lights go green and red very fast so that cars crash into each other. McClane and Farrell get out and walk to the FBI trailer outside. Farrell realizes that this is a "fire sale" – where everything being taken over by these hackers and it is called a fire sale because "everything must go."

McClane and Farrell then head to Middleton, Virginia, because some systems, like electricity, cannot be taken fully over with computers. However, Mai (Gabriel's girlfriend) is already at the plant and has taken over it. McClane attacks her and throws her to the ground and tells Farrell to put the system back up. Mai gets up and kicks him out of the building. McClane uses a car and rams her and they fight inside an elevator shaft. It ends when the car falls with Mai inside.

Farrell and McClane send a picture of Gabriel to the FBI, where they say that Gabriel was hired by them. Gabriel wanted tighter security, but they said no and fired him. Gabriel contacts the Middleton plant to ask what happened. He gets very angry when McClane tells him that Mai is dead and tells his hackers to send all the natural gas they can to the Middleton plant. He also finds Lucy and kidnaps her. The plant blows up and knocks all the power out in the nearby area. 

McClane and Farrell take a helicopter to Baltimore, Maryland to meet another computer hacker who calls himself The Warlock. He finds out where Gabriel is – at the Social Security Administration building in Woodlawn. Before the government fired him, Gabriel had made a system; when there was a computer attack, all financial data would be downloaded into the computers there. One of Gabriel's men went down there and starts downloading the data early on in the movie.

Both McClane and Farrell head down there. Gabriel takes Farrell and escapes with the data before McClane can reach him. McClane gets into the truck behind Gabriel's car. Gabriel calls in a jet fighter to attack McClane. During the fight, the highway is destroyed, but McClane manages to jump off and slide to safety, while the pilot ejects from the plane.

He then fights Gabriel inside a warehouse. McClane is shot and he loses his gun. Gabriel puts him in an arm lock and orders his man to shoot Lucy. McClane presses the gun into his shoulder and fires, injuring himself but killing Gabriel. Farrell wildly fires his gun to kill the man that is holding Lucy. The movie ends with the FBI swarming the area and taking Farrell and McClane to the hospital.

Die Hard with a Vengeance

Die Hard with a Vengeance is a 1995 action movie starring Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. It is the third movie in the "Die Hard" series.

Simon Gruber is the older brother of the villain from the first movie, Hans Gruber. Simon destroys a building in New York City. He says that he will destroy another one unless the police do what he tells them to do. His first task is to have John McClane to go Harlem and stand around for 15 minutes with a sign that says "I hate niggers" with his gun taped to his back so that he cannot reach it. A group of black men attack McClane. A shopkeeper named Zeus Carver saves McClane by grabbing the gun and getting into a taxicab.

The next task that Gruber has them do is to reach a pay phone. He then gives them a riddle and has them call back within 30 seconds to the right phone number (the answer to the riddle is the last four digits) or else the trash can full of explosives will be detonated. They call back with the right phone number but it is past 30 seconds. Carver and McClane duck out of the way as Gruber laughs.

The third task that Gruber sets for them is to reach the Wall Street subway station by 10:20 a.m. or else the station will be blown up. McClane and Carver steal a taxicab and cut through the park to reach the station in time. McClane stops at an earlier station and gets on the train. He then searches the train for the bomb and finds it. He throws it out of the cab car. Carver gets to the Wall Street station and picks up the phone, but because McClane is not there, Gruber says they did not follow his rules. The train rolls over the detonator and sets it off. The bomb explodes and destroys a large part of the station. McClane is injured but is alive.

The FBI come in and tell him that the man's name is Simon Gruber and that he is Hans' brother. Simon calls in again and tells him that he has placed a bomb inside one of the schools in New York City. Any attempt to get the children out will result in the bomb being blown up. He tells McClane and Carver to head to a park. The entire police force goes out and starts to search every school to find the bomb.

With the police gone, Simon Gruber and a bunch of dump trucks come in. They kill the security guards and begin to steal the gold from the vault in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. McClane and Carver arrive at the park and find another bomb. They use a five-gallon and three-gallon jug to make four gallons and put it on the weight to disable it. McClane catches a kid stealing something; the kid says that there's not a cop for miles around. McClane then goes to the Federal Reserve building and walks in. As Gruber's men escort him down, he asks them about lotto numbers and realizes that they're not the real cops and kills them.

McClane then drives a car out to intercept Gruber and his men. He has Carver go out to Yankee Stadium since that's what Gruber originally told them to do. Gruber drives into a aqueduct. McClane follows them in, but they flood it, causing a ton of water to rush out. McClane grabs a ladder and is sent flying into the air. Meanwhile, Carver went to Yankee Stadium and did not find anybody. Two of Gruber's men with sniper rifles are there to kill him, but decide to follow Carver instead since McClane is not with him. Carver is driving on a highway and sees McClane as he is thrown into the air. A car chase and gunfight take place as Gruber's men show up to try to kill them.

McClane and Carver find Gruber loading the gold onto a cargo boat in New York Harbor. After getting in, a few battles take place and Carver and McClane are captured by Gruber's men. They are then tied up and Gruber sets the fuse to blow the boat up. Before leaving, Gruber tosses McClane a bottle of aspirin. Gruber claims he is blowing up $100 billion of gold bullion but there is nothing inside; he is trying to make the value of gold higher by "destroying" the supply. McClane and Carver work their way out of the cuffs and jump to safety as the ship blows up.

They are rescued by the police. On the ship, McClane takes a quarter to call his wife. As he is being connected, he takes an aspirin, looks at the bottom, and realizes that Gruber is heading to Canada. They intercept him and fly a helicopter over his ship. In the ensuring fight, Gruber gets in his own helicopter and shoots and hits their helicopter, forcing them to land. McClane starts running to make Gruber shoot at him. He notices a bunch of power lines and shoots them. The lines fall on Gruber's helicopter and kill him.

Die Hard 2

Die Hard 2 (also called Die Hard 2: Die Harder) is an American action movie starring Bruce Willis, Bonnie Bedelia, and William Sadler. It was released on the Fourth of July weekend in 1990.

This movie begins on Christmas Eve 1990. John McClane is at the Washington Dulles Interntional Airport, waiting for his wife Holly's plane to land, and his car gets towed away. He argues with the airport security for a little bit before going inside. There, he sees a couple of men handing off a package to each other and does not like it. He goes to tell the airport police, but stops because the same man who towed his car is there. Instead, McClane enters the baggage area, where one of the men pulls a Glock gun and starts firing. During the gun fight, one man, named Oswald Cochrane, is killed when he goes through a baggage sorting machine. The other man manages to escape.

McClane tells the chief head of police, a man named Carmine Lorenzo, but Lorenzo thinks that these men are only "punks stealing luggage." McClane goes out there and gets fingerprints from the dead man. He faxes them to his friend Al Powell in Los Angeles, telling Powell to run the fingerprints through police records to find out who this person is. Powell does so and then gives McClane the man's record. The record says that Cochrane died two years ago in 1988 but is somehow still alive today. McClane believes he is a professional mercenary.

McClane goes to up to the airport tower and tells them that someone is about to "fuck with the airport." He says that he does not know what they will do. Lorenzo forces him out.

A man named Colonel Stuart then puts his plan into action. He cuts off all electronics inside the airport tower and takes control of all their items – the instrument that lands the planes and all radios. He then says that, in a couple of hours, a cargo plane will be landing. The plane has a man named Ramon Esperanza. Esperanza is the drug lord of the fictional country of Val Verde. The United States Justice Department is going to put him in jail. Stuart tells them that he wants a fully-fueled Boeing 747 to be put on the runway and says that nobody should touch the Esperanza's plane or try to restore the landing instruments.

McClane finds a janitor named Marvin. McClane has Marvin tell him where to go. Just before McClane was forced out, he heard that the air traffic controllers wanted to head to the Annex Skywalk, a new branch of the airport, to restore their systems. Lorenzo sends his SWAT team and the communications director, Leslie Barnes, to head to the Skywalk. As McClane expected, Stuart's men attack the SWAT team. They kill all five members and are about to kill Barnes when McClane comes through a vent shaft and kills them all. 

Moments later, the antenna outpost explodes. It was a trap. Stuart then calls in to tell them that it was stupid to try to restore their systems. He then picks a flight that is low on fuel. He resets the ground level of the landing system to be 200 feet below, so that when the plane is at 200 feet they think they're at 400 feet. He then crashes the plane into the ground, killing all of the passengers on board.

Afterwards, a Special Forces unit from the United States Army comes in, led by Major Grant. They take a meeting in the pilot's briefing room. McClane gets Marvin to try to tell him where the room is. During the search, McClane finds a two-way radio that one of Stuart's men dropped. He listens in and finds out that Esperanza has taken over the plane and shot the two pilots. The plane is out of control and he needs to land right away. Stuart tells him to land on the nearest runway. 

McClane gets out there first and punches him before Stuart's men show up. They trap him in the cockpit and throw grenades. McClane escapes by strapping up in the pilot's ejection seat and blasting off as the grenades explode.

Barnes listens to McClane's story. Because Stuart's men showed up so fast, Barnes thinks that they must be close by. They find the church where they are basing their operations and send in the Army Special Forces out there to fight. During the gun battle, McClane sees that Stuart's men are escaping on snowmobiles. He shoots one guy with a gun that he stole, takes his mobile, and chases after them. However his gun does not work and his mobile gets shot and he falls down. He opens his gun and finds that there were rubber bullets in there. He realizes that Stuart and the special forces are working together.

McClane comes back to the airport. He says that they are working together. Lorezno does not believe him until McClane fires the gun to show that they are rubber bullets. Meanwhile, the people at the airport are panicked. A reporter named Richard Thornberg has broadcast that terrorists have taken over the airport. As a result, Lorenzo and McClane cannot get out there fast enough.

Instead, McClane gets a ride with Samantha Coleman and her news helicopter. The 747 has already left the hanger. McClane gets the pilot to drop him over the wing of the 747. Esperanza, who is flying the plane, sees McClane. Grant goes out there fights but is sucked into the engine of the plane. McClane finds the fuel hatch. When Stuart kicks McClane off the plane, McClane manages to open it and the plane starts losing fuel. McClane then takes his cigarette lighter and ignites the fuel and the plane blows up.

The fire trail of the plane allows the planes flying overhead to see the ground. Holly lands safely and the two of them come back together. The movie ends with Marvin driving them off.

Die Hard

Die Hard is an American action movie starring Bruce Willis. It is the first movie in the "Die Hard" series.

The movie is set on Christmas Eve at the Nakatomi building in Los Angeles, California. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is flying in from New York to meet his wife Holly during the Nakatomi’s annual Christmas party. While there, they get into an argument over Holly's choice to use her maiden name instead of her married name. Shortly afterwards, a group of German terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) invade the building and take all the people hostages. They want the bearer bonds in the building ' s vault and ask the CEO, Joseph Takgai, for the access code to the first barrier. When he says no, Gruber shoots and kills him.

McClane witnesses Gruber killing Takagi and tries to get help. He pulls a fire alarm, but the terrorists find out and reverse the alarm. Gruber then sends a man named Tony to find whoever pulled the alarm. In the ensuring battle, McClane snaps Tony's neck and takes his machine gun. He then puts the dead man in an elevator and pushes buttons so that it stops on the floor where the partygoers are being held. Upon finding Tony, Gruber sends more men to find him. After killing two more of Gruber's men, McClane finds and takes some detonators.

On the rooftop, McClane radios for help. The dispatchers send a patrol car in. Just as the police officer is about to leave, McClane drops the body of a dead terrorist on his patrol car. The LAPD arrive. They send in a tank and four SWAT team members, but Gruber's men beat back both attacks. When Gruber ignores McClane's request to stop attacking, McClane takes some C4 explosives and blows up part of the building.

Holly's co-worker Harry then tries to talk to the terrorists. He tries to get McClane to give up the detonators, but when he refuses, Gruber shoots and kills Harry. Shortly afterwards, McClane finds Gruber, who was trying to check the explosives. Gruber fakes an American accent, throwing McClane off. As they talk, Gruber's men show up and shoot out the glass. McClane injures his feet severely as he tries to walk across the floor and loses the detonators in the process.

The FBI arrives and orders the building's power to be cut. Gruber informs the FBI that he wants two helicopters and he will escort the hostages to the top of the building. The power outage opens up the final locks on the building's vault, where Gruber scoops up the bonds. The FBI plans to send gunships to kill the terrorists, but Gruber had lined the top of the building with explosives and plans to blow it up to cover his escape.

A reporter named Richard Thornberg manages to interview McClane's children. Gruber, seeing this on TV, realizes that Holly is McClane's wife and takes her hostage. McClane finds the explosives and realizes what Gruber is up to. However, Gruber's man Karl finds him and they engage in a vicious hand-to-hand combat. McClane leaves Karl for dead and rushes up to the top of the building. He and forces the hostages to go back down into the building. The FBI fires at him. Gruber blows up the top of the building. McClane ties a fire hose around his waist and jumps off the building.

McClane finally meets Gruber one last time. He tricks him by throwing his gun down and then using another gun to shoot Gruber. Gruber falls out of the building, nearly taking Holly with him. McClane unties her watch and Gruber falls to his death. Afterwards, they go home in a limo.

Pikmin (series)

Pikmin is a series of video games created by Nintendo that started on the Nintendo GameCube in 2001. It has two released games - "Pikmin" and "Pikmin 2", and it has an upcoming game that will be on the Wii or Nintendo DS. The series is about a spaceman called Captain Olimar visiting an alien planet and working with creatures called Pikmin to explore it.


"Pikmin" is set on a world that is supposed to be Earth, but Captain Olimar is very tiny, so it looks like a strange world to the player. The first level of "Pikmin" looks like Shigeru Miyamoto's backyard. Nintendo made it seem more like Earth by adding common items, like a globe of the Earth, a Duracell battery, and a Pepsi bottle cap.

Both games use real-time strategy gameplay. The player plays as Captain Olimar, who can command his Pikmin. Olimar gets Pikmin by bringing pellets, a type of food, and bad guys to an Onion, which is the Pikmin's ship. Pikmin will come out of the Onion and get planted in the ground so that Olimar can pull them out. Olimar can use Pikmin to take stuff back to his base, fight insects and other creatures, or travel across places.

"Pikmin" is the first game in the series and came out in 2001 on the Nintendo GameCube. Captain Olimar crashlands on an alien planet, and unites with a creature called Pikmin. He only has 30 days life support, and so he and the Pikmin try to find the pieces of his ship that broke off so he can escape.

"Pikmin 2" came out in 2004 for the Nintendo GameCube. It uses the same gameplay, but adds a new character called Louie, two new kinds of Pikmin, and a new type of area called Underground, where Olimar and Louie search for treasure in. It also added multiplayer, where one player can be Olimar and another can be Louie.

A new "Pikmin" game will come out in the future, but has no name or console yet. It was announced at Nintendo's developer roundtable at E3.

"Pikmin" has appeared in the "Super Smash Bros." series. In "Super Smash Bros. Melee", "Pikmin" has a couple of collectibles of Captain Olimar and the Pikmin. In "Super Smash Bros. Brawl", Captain Olimar is a playable character along with his Pikmin. Music, enemies, and an area are also taken from the series for stuff in "Brawl".

Red-necked Wallaby

The Red-necked Wallaby ("Macropus rufogriseus") is a medium-sized macropod, common in parts of eastern Australia. As one of the largest wallabies, it looks like a kangaroo. Males can weigh more than 20 kg and have a head-body length of 90 cm. 

Red-necked Wallabies have a black nose and paws, white stripe on the upper lip, and a medium grey coat with a red color on their neck.

Red-necked Wallabies are found along the coast and forests of eastern Australia, from Rockhampton, Queensland to the South Australian border; in Tasmania and on many of the Bass Strait islands (many of these may have been introduced to the islands). 

In Tasmania, north-east New South Wales and coastal Queensland, their numbers have got bigger over the past 30 years. This is because they are no longer hunted. A lot of forest has been cleared for grass where wallabies can feed at night, alongside trees where they can shelter by day. It is less common in Victoria.

Like most macropods, the Red-necked Wallaby lives by itself. Groups, also called mobs, share feeding areas. They feed at night and in the late afternoon, generally eating grass and herbs close to forest shelter.

There are two subspecies. The Tasmanian form, "Macropus rufogriseus rufogriseus", also called Bennett's Wallaby is smaller, has longer fur, and breeds in the late summer, mostly between February and April. They can live close to people and are seen feeding on lawns in the suburbs of Hobart and other towns.

The mainland form, "Macropus rufogriseus banksianus", breeds all year round. A female can have babies at the about 14 months old. A baby red-necked wallaby, called a joey, lives in the mothers pouch for 9 months, and continues to feed from the mother till about 12-15 months of age.

Battle of Baghdad (1258)

The Battle of Baghdad in 1258 was a victory for the Mongol leader Hulagu Khan, a grandson of Genghis Khan. Baghdad was captured, sacked, and over time burned. 

Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Empire. This was an Islamic empire in what is now Iraq. The Abbasid caliphs were the second of the Islamic dynasties,

The Mongol army, led by Hulagu (also spelled as Hulegu) Khan and the Chinese commander Guo Kan in vice-command, set out for Baghdad in November of 1257. Hulagu marched with what was probably the largest army ever fielded by the Mongols. By order of Mongke Khan, one in ten fighting men in the entire empire were gathered for Hulagu's army (Saunders 1971). The attacking army also had a large contingent of Christian forces. 

Hulagu demanded surrender; the caliph refused. Many accounts say that the caliph failed to prepare for the fight; he neither gathered armies nor strengthened the walls of Baghdad. 

Hulagu divided his forces, so that they threatened both sides of the city, on the east and west banks of the Tigris. The attacking Mongols broke some dikes and flooded the ground behind the caliph’s army, trapping them. Much of the army was slaughtered or drowned.

Under Guo Kan's order, the Chinese counterparts in the Mongolian army then laid siege to the city, constructing a palisade and ditch, wheeling up siege engines and catapults. The siege started on January 29. The battle was swift, by siege standards. By February 5 the Mongols controlled a stretch of the wall. Al-Musta'sim tried to negotiate, but was refused. 

On February 10 Baghdad surrendered. The Mongols swept into the city on February 13 and began a week of massacre, looting, rape, and destruction.

Super OS

Super OS (formerly: Super Ubuntu) is a free Linux distribution. It is a modified version of Ubuntu made with reconstructor. Its main goal is to provide an ‘Out of the Box’ experience, containing various enhancements over Ubuntu. It has the goal of remaining compatible with Ubuntu.


"App Runner" is a script included in "Super OS" that allows any kind of executable or script to be launched without having to use the command line. App Runner was also subject of an article by Lifehacker, saying ""App Runner would come in handy"" and ""there's plenty of scripts and closed-source apps that this would be useful for"".

There is also a Windows tool called "cd2usb" to create Ubuntu and "Super OS" Live USBs. The program is already included in the DVD of "Super OS".

The "RUNZ Framework" is a tool that allows the use of portable apps and something called "SuperDebs" (an installer with a .deb file + its dependencies that can be installed offline) in "Super OS". It is already included in "Super OS 9.04 SP 0.1+"

In addition to the official Ubuntu repositories, Super OS also includes its own repositories, which include third-party software like Adobe Reader, Skype, Real Player, TrueCrypt, PeaZip, Google Chrome or Ubuntu calendar, but also include tools/software developed by "hacktolive", like App Runner and RUNZ.

"Super OS" has been received mainly with positive reviews, with softpedia saying ""it is a distribution with super powers […] [due to] the inclusion of applications, tools and technologies that are missing from a standard Ubuntu"". "Super OS" (still with the name "Super Ubuntu" at the time), was also Lifehacker's "featured download" saying ""It's basically just a re-compiled version of the official Ubuntu distribution, but with a whole bunch of features included that save you the time of grabbing them yourself""."Super OS" is also the OS that the Helios project (a non-profit organization to give away computers to children without the money to buy them) pre-loads on most of the computers they give away. , Super OS is in the top 100 of the page hit ranking of DistroWatch, .

Sahelanthropus tchadensis

Sahelanthropus tchadensis is a fossil hominid. From evidence at the fossil site in Chad in the African Sahel, it is thought to have lived about 7 million years ago. 

The split of the line into humans and chimpanzees (known as "human-chimpanzee divergence") probably happened between 6.3 and 5.4 million years ago. This can be seen from genetic data. Because the fossil is older than this spilt, its status is unclear. The first fossil found is known as "Toumaï" today.
Some fossils, a cranium (skull), five pieces of jaw, and some teeth, make up a head that has features that are like both modern and primitive humans. The braincase is only 340 cm³ to 360 cm³ in volume, about the same as chimpanzees. It is much less than the human volume of about 1350 cm³.

The teeth and structure of the face are very different from Homo sapiens. The cranium found is damaged, it is very distorted, so no 3D computer reconstruction has been made. There are no bones other than parts of the skull. It is unknown if "Sahelanthropus tchadensis" was bipedal (walked on two legs). The placement of the foramen magnum suggests they were, though. Its canine wear is similar to other Miocene apes.

"Sahelanthropus" may be an ancestor of both humans and chimpanzees; no consensus has been reached yet by the scientific community. The difficulty is caused by its "mosaic of primitive and derived features". Probably it lived in semi-open woodland and savannah, rather than the rainforest of present-day apes.

Another possibility is that Toumaï is related to both humans and chimpanzees, but is the ancestor of neither. Brigitte Senut and Martin Pickford, the discoverers of "Orrorin tugenensis", suggested that the features of "S. tchadensis" are consistent with a female proto-gorilla. Even if this claim is upheld, the find would still be significant, for at present few chimpanzee or gorilla ancestors have been found anywhere in Africa. Thus, if "S. tchadensis" is an ancestral relative of the chimpanzees (or gorillas), it represents the first known member of "their" lineage. 

Furthermore, "S. tchadensis" does indicate that the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees is unlikely to resemble chimpanzees very much, as had been previously supposed by some paleontologists.

The fauna found at the site suggest an age of more than 6 million years, as these species were probably extinct already by that time.

Murray Langston

Murray Langston is a Canadian comedian and writer. His television work includes "The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour", "Make Me Laugh", and "The Gong Show".

Langston is best known, oddly enough, as The Unknown Comic — a comedian who appears onstage wearing a paper bag over his head. He first appeared as the Unknown Comic on "The Gong Show". He did not want his true identity known, because an appearance on an amateur show could have hurt his comedy career, when he was already well-known.

Audiences liked the Unknown Comic, and Langston began to appear as that character on other shows, and in live performances. In time, Langston was as famous for the character as for himself. When he was finally unmasked in public (on a television show called "Real People"), the two careers became one. Langston has performed both as himself and as the Unknown Comic ever since.

Langston partly retired from his career during the 1990s, to focus on raising his daughter.

Australopithecine

The term Australopithecine refers to any species in the related genera "Australopithecus" or "Paranthropus". These species occurred in the Pliocene–Pleistocene era, and were bipedal. The arrangement of their teeth, especially the dental arcade, was similar to humans. 

They had a brain size not much larger than modern apes, lacking the large brain of the genus "Homo". 

They are classified within the Hominina subtribe of the Hominini tribe. These are sub-divisions of the Hominid family. They appeared in the Pliocene.


When used alone, the term refers to both genera together. "Australopithecus" is sometimes referred to as the "gracile (slender) australopithecines", while "Paranthropus" are also called the "robust australopithecines".

A likely ancestor of the Australopithecines is the genus "Ardipithecus" genus, which lived in East Africa. The genus "Homo" (humans), appears about 2.4 million years ago with "Homo habilis". They may be descended from australopithecine ancestors, more precisely from "Kenyanthropus platyops" branching off "Australopithecus" some 3.5 million years ago. 

An alternative possibility is that "Homo" derived directly from "Ardipithecus", with an as yet undiscovered link connecting "Ardipithecus" and "Homo habilis" existing in parallel to the Australopithecines in the period 4 to 2.5 million years ago.

<doc id="120185" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=120185" title="Sahara pump theory">
Sahara pump theory

The Saraha Pump Theory attempts to explain how plants and animals from Africa moved into the Middle East and then Europe and Asia. 

At the time, Africa was rainier than it is today, and the Sahara was wetter, with bigger lakes and more rivers. 

African rainy periods are associated with a "wet Sahara" phase, during which larger lakes and more rivers exist. This causes changes in the type of animals found in the area. 

Regardless of the aridity of the greater Sahara, migration along the river corridor was halted when, during a desert phase 1.8-0.8 million years ago, the Nile ceased to flow completely and possibly flowed only temporarily in other periods due to Nubian Swell uplift.

During the periods of a wet Sahara, the Sahara and Arabia become a savanna grassland and African flora and fauna become common. During the following dry period, the Sahara reverts to desert conditions usually as a result of the retreat of the West African Monsoon southwards. Evaporation exceeds precipitation, the level of water in lakes like Lake Chad falls, and rivers become dry wadis. 

Flora and fauna previously widespread retreat northwards to the Atlas Mountains, southwards into West Africa, or eastwards into the Nile Valley and thence either south-east to the Ethiopian Highlands and Kenya or north-east across the Sinai into Asia. This separates populations of some of the species in areas with different climates, forcing them to adapt, possibly giving rise to speciation (species splitting).

The Saharan pump has been used to date four waves of human emigration from Africa, namely:

Northwest has three major hubs in the United States: Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, and Memphis International Airport. Northwest also operates flights from a small hub in Asia at Narita International Airport near Tokyo and also operates transatlantic flights in cooperation with partner KLM from Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. It also maintains focus city operations at Indianapolis International Airport and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.

As of 2006 Northwest was the world's sixth largest airline in terms of domestic and international scheduled passenger miles flown and the U.S.'s sixth largest airline in terms of domestic passenger miles flown. In addition to operating one of the largest domestic route networks in the U.S., Northwest carries more passengers across the Pacific Ocean (5.1 million in 2004) than any other U.S. carrier, and carries more domestic air cargo than any other American passenger airline. It is the only U.S. combination carrier (passenger and cargo service) operating dedicated Boeing 747 freighters. The airline, along with its parent company, Northwest Airlines Corporation and subsidiaries, operated under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection which, in the United States, allows continued operation during the reorganization effort, not stopping flights as in the case in some countries. Northwest emerged from bankruptcy protection on May 31, 2007.

Northwest Airlines' regional flights are operated under the name Northwest Airlink by Mesaba Airlines, Pinnacle Airlines, and Compass Airlines. Northwest Airlines is currently a minority owner of Midwest Airlines, holding a 40% stake in the company. Its frequent flyer program is called WorldPerks. Northwest Airlines' tagline is "Now you're flying smart." 

On April 14, 2008, Northwest announced it will be merging with Delta Air Lines, subject to regulatory review. If approved, the new airline will retain only the Delta Air Lines name and brand, and become the largest airline in the world.

Indie pop

Indie pop is a genre of alternative rock which originated in the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Originally and often still a form of independent music, it is closely associated with indie rock, both genres are similar, yet there are differences between both. Indie rock tends to be edgier, rougher and harsher-sounding, contrasting the more melodious indie pop. Indie pop additionally takes influences from 1960s girl group music and power pop, often giving it retro elements, and makes usage of jangly guitars.

In 1986, British music magazine "NME" released a cassette called "C86", which included indie pop and indie rock music; the artists in "C86" made music which was described by About.com as "a twee, amateurish form of home-made music drawing deeply from sunny '60s acts like The Byrds and the Velvet Underground."

Early indie pop bands include The Shop Assistants or The Pastels. More recent bands in the genre include Point blank, Travis, The Research and Maritime.

Stuttering

Stuttering or Stammering is a problem some people have when they speak. 5-6% of children have a stammer while 1% of adults have a stammer. Men are 4 times more likely to have a stammer than women. Stammers normally start at 2-6 years and run in families. The person knows what they want to say but the flow of their speech is ‘bumpy’ and may have some of the following features:

Stammering can be very upsetting and knock a persons confidence. Joseph Sheehan compared stuttering to an iceberg, with the bumpy parts you can hear (overt parts) of stuttering above the waterline, and the larger block of how the person feels (covert parts) invisible below the surface. These people may feel embarrassment, shame, frustration, fear, anger, and guilt These feelings may increase stress and effort making the person stammer more. Such negative feelings may be an important part of a treatment program.
Stammers affect peoples lives as they may not have the confidence to apply for job interviews or make friends.

Stuttering therapy
This therapy is also known as "speak more fluently", "prolonged speech" or "connected speech." It trains stutterers to speak fluently (without the ‘bumpy bits’) by controlling their breathing and how they move their lips, jaw, and tongue.
Stutterers are trained to slow down their speaking rate by stretching vowels and consonants. Other methods include soft speech contacts. This helps to make very slow but non bumpy speech used only in the speech clinic. To make more normal sounding speech for daily life speed of speech is increased. Sadly many people find their speech does not sound natural at the end of therapy. Fluency shaping approaches are normally taught in groups therapy programs, which may take two to three weeks to complete. More recently the Camperdown program, using a much shorter schedule, has been shown to work well.

The goal of stuttering modification therapy is not to get rid of stuttering but to change it so that stuttering is easier and less stressful. As fear and worry make people stutter by getting rid of these feelings stuttering will decrease. The most widely known approach was made by Charles Van Riper in 1973 and is also known as block modification therapy. Stuttering modification therapy has four stages: 

There were many famous "stutterers":

<doc id="120211" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=120211" title="Life expectancy">
Life expectancy

Life expectancy is how long a person is expected to live. It is based on many factors such as place of living (country), life style including (smoking habit, diet, exercise) etc.
There are great changes in life expectancy between different parts of the world, mostly caused by differences in public health, medical care and diet. Much of the excess mortality (higher death rates) in poorer nations is due to war, not enough food, and diseases (AIDS, Malaria, etc.). 

Over the past 200 years, countries with Black or African populations have generally not had the same improvements in mortality rates that have been enjoyed by European people. Even in countries with a majority of White people, such as USA, Britain, Ireland and France, Black people tend to have shorter life expectancies than their White counterparts (although often the statistics are not analysed by race). For example, in the U.S. White Americans are expected to live until age 78, but African Americans only until age 71.

Climate may also have an effect, and the way data is collected may also influence the figures. According to the CIA World Factbook, Macau has the world's longest life expectancy of 84.4 years.

There are also significant differences in life expectancy between men and women in most countries, with women typically outliving men by around five years. Economic circumstances also affect life expectancy. For example, in the United Kingdom, life expectancy in the richest areas is several years longer than in the poorest areas. This may reflect factors such as diet and lifestyle as well as access to medical care. It may also reflect a selective effect: people with chronic life-threatening illnesses are less likely to become wealthy or to reside in rich areas.

Demosthenes

Demosthenes (384–322 BC, Greek: Δημοσθένης, Dēmosthénēs) was a well-known Greek statesman and orator of ancient Athens. His speeches show well, how agile Athenians were, when speaking. They also give an insight into the politics and culture of ancient Greece during the 4th century BC. Demosthenes learned rhetoric by studying the speeches of previous great orators. He delivered his first judicial speeches when he was twenty. He argued effectively to gain from his guardians what was left of his inheritance. For a time, Demosthenes made his living as a professional speech-writer and a lawyer, writing speeches for use in private legal suits. 

At the age of 21, Demosthenes took the job of the commander of warships in the classical Greek world.

Demosthenes grew interested in politics during the time he wrote speeches for others. In 354 BC he gave his first public political speeches. He went on to devote his most productive years to opposing Macedon's expansion. He idealized his city and tried throughout his life to restore Athens' supremacy and motivate his compatriots against Philip II of Macedon. He sought to preserve his city's freedom and to establish an alliance against Macedon, in an unsuccessful attempt to impede Philip's plans to expand his influence southwards by conquering all the Greek states. After Philip's death, Demosthenes played a leading part in his city's uprising against the new King of Macedon, Alexander the Great. However, his efforts failed and the revolt was met with a harsh Macedonian reaction. To prevent a similar revolt against his own rule, Alexander's successor, Antipater, sent his men to track Demosthenes down. Demosthenes took his own life, in order to avoid being arrested by Archias, Antipater's confidant.

The "Alexandrian Canon" compiled by Aristophanes of Byzantium and Aristarchus of Samothrace recognized Demosthenes as one of the ten greatest Attic orators and logographers. According to Longinus, Demosthenes "perfected to the utmost the tone of lofty speech, living passions, copiousness, readiness, speed". Cicero acclaimed him as "the perfect orator" who lacked nothing, and Quintilian extolled him as "lex orandi" ("the standard of oratory") and that "inter omnes unus excellat" ("he stands alone among all the orators").

Joystick

A joystick is an input device consisting of a stick that pivots on a base and reports its angle or direction to the device it is controlling. Joysticks are often used to control video games, and usually have one or more push-buttons whose state can also be read by the computer. A popular variation of the joystick used on modern video game consoles is the analog stick.

The joystick has been the principal flight control in the cockpit of many aircraft, particularly military fast jets, where centre stick or side-stick location may be employed. 

Joysticks are also used for controlling machines such as cranes, trucks, underwater unmanned vehicles and zero turning radius lawn mowers. Miniature finger-operated joysticks have been adopted as input devices for smaller electronic equipment such as mobile phones.

Animal Crossing, known as in Japan, is a life simulation video game made by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 and Nintendo GameCube game consoles. It was only released on the Nintendo 64 in Japan in 2001. In 2002, it was released in North America, Europe and Australia for the Nintendo GameCube. 

It supports the GameCube-Game Boy Advance link cable and the e-Reader items and has emulated Nintendo Entertainment System games in it as items. That means that the player can replay old NES games within the game itself.

In Animal Crossing the player moves into a village where everyone is an animal. Only the player is human. 1-4 people can move to the village and live in their own house. They have to pay money (called "bells") for the house, and when they did it the house will get bigger. Bells can be earned by fishing, catching insects, selling things and other ways. The players can buy the things they like by Tom Nook (a racoon who has got a shop in the village) and put them in their houses. If their house looks nice, they get points and things from the HRA (Happy Room Academy). They also can buy clothes. The game is played in real time and has no ending. You can visit the villages of other players by using their Memory Card

The animals are different. There are different kinds of animals (for example cats, mice or dogs) and different characters (for example lazy, active...)

Tom Nook is a racoon who has got a shop called "Nook's Cranny" where you can buy things for your house or clothes. If you buy many things it gets bigger. You work there at the beginning of the game to pay for your house.

Mable and Sable are two hedgehogs who have a shop called "Able Sisters" where players can make their own clothes.

Tortimer is an old turtle who is the mayor of the village.

Pelly and Phyllis are two pelicans who work at the post. You can send letters to the villagers.

Resetti is an angry mole. He comes when you reset the game and don't save it.

K.K. Slider is a dog who comes to the train station every saturday evening at 8.00 pm. He sings songs. You can take them to your house and listen to them there.

At some days there are special things in Animal Crossing, some of them like days in real life, for example Christmas, Halloween or Thanksgiving. Some are special events which are only in the game like fishing competitions. Sometimes you can get special items at days like that, for example Christmas clothes and furniture.

There are nineteen NES games in Animal Crossing: Balloon Fight, Baseball, Clu Clu Land, Clu Clu Land D, Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong 3, Donkey Kong Jr., Donkey Kong Jr. Math, Excitebike, Golf, Pinball, Punch-Out!!, Soccer, Tennis, Wario's Woods; Ice Climber and Mario Bros. (only with e-Reader); Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda (only with hacking). They work just like the original games.

The title is also used by Shia Muslims to refer to their first Imam, Ali ibn Abi Talib, since he was also the Caliph. Sunni Muslims use it to refer to the first four Caliphs. It has also been adopted by various Caliphs of the succeeding Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties, as well as by some contemporary Arab monarchs.

Sunni view that Abu Bakr was the first person to be given the title.
Shi'a view that Ali, the prophet of Islam's son-in-law and the only person to father the prophets only continuing lineage, was given the title during Muhammad's era.

Scranton, Pennsylvania

Scranton is a city in Pennsylvania. It is the county seat of Lackawanna County. The city had a population of 76,415 people in 2000. 

Scranton was first settled in 1776 by Lenape Indians. Over time, settlers from New England began to move to Scranton. They built mills and other small businesses. The village was known as Slocum Hollow. In 1845, Scranton started to manufacture iron and steel. The iron was used for making rails. Scranton became a leading maker of iron rails. A railroad was founded in 1851. It was built to move iron and coal. 

Scranton became a borough in 1856. In 1866, Scranton was made a city when Hyde Park and Providence joined together with the Borough of Scranton. The city had 35,000 people living in it. In 1866, a streetcar system was built. It was the first in the United States. Scranton got the nickname "The Electric City" because of this. In the late 1890s, Scranton had several minor league baseball teams.

The United States Census said that Scranton had a population of 102,026 people in the year 1900. This made it the 38th largest city in the United States. In the 1900s, Scranton was known for its many Victorian-style houses.

In 1901, the iron industry in Scranton moved to Lackawanna, New York. Scranton lost one of its main industries. In the next 25 years, many people from Eastern Europe moved to Scranton. Two years later, the Laurel Line railroad opened up, making it easy to go to Wilkes-Barre, 20 miles South. After World War II, coal began losing cleaner fuels such as oil and gas. This caused Scranton to diminish. There wasn't as much coal being made, and not as many trains passed through. The streetcar system stopped in 1954, and a year later, the city was flooded after Hurricane Diane. 80 people died. The NYO&W freight railroad stopped going to Scranton in 1957.

The Knox Mine Disaster of 1959 wiped out the mining industry as the Susquehanna River flooded most of the mines in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The local DL&W railroad, nearly out of money, merged with the Erie Railroad in 1960. In the 1960s and 1970s, the silk and textile industries was getting smaller as they moved South or overseas. In the 1970s and 1980s, the downtown shops lay empty as it was best to shop in suburban malls. However, in the 1980s, the people of Scranton started revitalizing the city. Old places were marketed as tourist attractions. There is a historic site commemorating the city's railroad history, a hotel at the former DL&W Railroad station and a trolley museum. Some more modern attractions are a ski resort, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees (a minor league baseball team) and a concert venue. Also, popular sitcom The Office is set in Scranton.

Necronomicon

The Necronomicon is a fictional book of magic created by the horror writer H. P. Lovecraft. It is a Greek-sounding word commonly translated as "book of dead names". It is pronounced "neck-ro-nom-ih-kon". Like most his ideas, the "Necronomicon" came to Lovecraft in his dreams. Lovecraft let his friends write stories about the "Necronomicon". Eventually, fake "Necronomicon"s were written.

According to Lovecraft, the "Necronomicon" was written in the eighth century by a crazy Arabian man named Abdul Alhazred. Alhazred (who was also fictional) practiced evil magic. He assembled a collection of evil spells into a manuscript (a book with loose pages and no cover) which he called "Al Azif". Lovecraft said this as an Arabian phrase for a scary sound, like a scream. Later, the original manuscript was translated into Greek. It was given the title "Necronomicon". Olaus Wormius (a real person) then translated the Greek version into Latin. John Dee (also real) translated the "Necronomicon" into English. Lovecraft liked to mix in real people and places in his fiction. This made the stories seem more real. Some people were fooled into thinking what he wrote was true.

Since Lovecraft's death, several authors have written their own versions of the "Necronomicon". They are the author's imagination of what the "Necronomicon" would be like, if it were real. A few claim to be the actual "Necronomicon". The most famous case of a "real" "Necronomicon" is the "Simon" "Necronomicon". Simon is a fake name. It was published in the 1970s. The "Simon" "Necronomicon" is based on Sumerian mythology. It has nothing to do with H. P. Lovecraft's fiction. Some people dislike the "Simon" "Necronomicon".

Occult

Occult refers to an area of knowledge or thought that is hidden. The word occult has many uses in the English language. Often it means knowledge that lies outside the range of normal experience or scientific explanation. The term sometimes means knowledge meant only for certain people or knowledge that must be kept hidden. For most occultists it is the study of a deeper spiritual reality.

The term occult is also used as a label given to a number of magical organizations or orders, and the teachings and practices as taught by them. The name also extends to a large body of literature and spiritual philosophy.

Occultism is the study of occult. It can involve such subjects as magic (alternatively spelled and defined as magick), extra-sensory perception, astrology, spiritualism, numerology and lucid dreaming. There is often a strong religious element to these studies and beliefs, and many occultists profess adherence to religions such as Gnosticism, Hermeticism, Satanism, Thelema, and Neopaganism. While Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam are generally not considered as occult, some of their modern interpretations can be, such as the interpretation of Hinduism within Theosophy or the various occult interpretations of the Jewish Kabbalah.

Alchemy, is considered an occult practice. Alchemy used to be common among scientists, such as Isaac Newton. During the Age of Enlightenment alchemy and science went their separate ways. Newton was accused of introducing occult agencies into natural science when he proposed that gravity was a force capable of acting over vast distances.

Ghost town

A ghost town is a name for a city in which no one lives anymore. It can happen because of economical reasons (for instance, a town of gold miners who cannot find gold anymore), a natural disaster (a flood, or a very long drought) or even a man- made disaster (for example, the nuclear fallout that emptied the town of Prypiat, Ukraine). Some ghost towns are kept intact as tourist attractions.

Rain dance

A rain dance is a ceremonial dance. It is performed by people who believe it will cause rain and keep their harvest safe. 

Many different types of "rain dances" can be found in many cultures, from Ancient Egypt to certain Native American tribes. In the 20th century Balkans, a ritual known as Paparuda (Romanian) or Perperuna (Slavic) is a type of rain dance. 

The Cherokee tribe, an ethnic Native American tribe from the Southeastern United States used rain dances to both create rain and to remove evil spirits from the earth. The legend of the tribe says that the rain created has the spirits of the former leaders of the tribe. During the rain, these spirits fight the evil spirits in a place between our reality and the spirit world. These raindances are also seen as acts of worship.

Julia M. Butree in her book, describes the "Rain Dance of Zuni" and other Native American dances

Feathers and turquoise are worn during the dance. They symbolize wind and rain. Many traditions of the Rain Dance are passed down through history by people telling their children about them in stories.

The term Rain Dance is described in the "Jargon File" of hackers.

In search and rescue, "rain dance" is a way to decide how far apart people should be in a line so that they do not miss finding something or waste effort.

In an early type of meteorology, Native Americans in the midwestern parts of modern United States often tracked and followed known weather patterns. They would do a raindance for settlers in return for trade items. This is best known to happen among Osage and Quapaw Indian tribes of Missouri and Arkansas.

<doc id="120359" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=120359" title="Louse">
Louse

Lice (singular: louse), are wingless insects that live in hair. They are all external parasites on every species of bird and most mammalian orders. They are not found on Monotremes and a few eutherian orders, namely the bats (Chiroptera), whales, dolphins and porpoises (Cetacea) and pangolins (Pholidota). There are more than 3,000 different species; three are classified as human lice. 

Lice spend their whole life on the host. They are adapted to keep close contact with the host. These adaptations are reflected in their size (0.5–8 mm), stout legs, and claws which are adapted to clinging tightly to hair, fur and feathers. They are also wingless and flattened.

Lice feed on skin (epidermal) debris, feather parts, sebaceous secretions and blood. A louse's color varies from pale beige to dark grey; however, if feeding on blood, it may become considerably darker.

A louse's egg is commonly called a "nit". Lice attach their eggs to their host's hair with specialized saliva which results in a bond that is very difficult to separate without specialized products. Living lice eggs tend to be pale white. Dead lice eggs are more yellow. Lice are very annoying and are difficult to remove, but not impossible. The process is called "nit-picking", and is often done with a close-toothed metal comb. For humans, anti-insect shampoos are available.

The order has traditionally been divided into two suborders; the "sucking lice" (Anoplura) and "chewing lice" (Mallophaga). Four suborders are now recognised:


It has been suggested that the order is contained by the Troctomorpha suborder of Psocoptera. What this means is that lice may have evolved from free-living species of that group.

Humans are unique in that they host three different species of lice: head lice, body lice (which live mainly in clothing), and pubic lice. The DNA differences between head lice and body lice provide corroborating evidence that humans started wearing clothes at approximately 70,000 BCE.

Recent DNA evidence suggests that pubic lice spread to the ancestors of humans approximately 3.3 million years ago from the ancestors of gorillas by sharing the same bed or other communal areas with them, and are more closely related to lice endemic to gorillas than to other lice species infesting humans.

An impala ("Aepyceros melampus") is a medium-sized African antelope. The name "impala" comes from the Zulu language.

The impala is reddish-brown with white hair inside the ears, over each eye and on the chin, upper throat, underparts and buttocks. A narrow black line runs along the middle of the lower back to the tail, and a vertical black stripe appears on the back of each thigh. Impalas have unique brushlike tufts of black hair that cover a scent gland located just above the heel on each hind leg.

The impala can jump more than 10 meters distance and 3 meters high, and can reach running speeds of about 80 to 90 km/h, to escape from predators.

Impalas are found at grassland and woodland edges, usually very close by water.

Metroid Prime 3: Corruption

Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is a first-person adventure video game made by Retro Studios and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Wii game console.

This game begins with a meeting between Samus and three other bounty hunters (Basically, hunters who are looking to do good) about a computer virus(computer crashes) caused by Phazon. The four bounty hunters must try and stop it. But in the middle of the meeting, some Space Pirates crash into the frigate(a big space ship) and stop the meeting. Samus and the other bounty hunters must instead stop both the Space Pirates and the virus. Samus lands on the local planet, Norion, and must bring Generators A, B, and C online.

As Samus prepares to activate the last generator, Meta Ridley flies in and breaks the floor of the generator area, and Samus is forced to fight him in a long hole down to the planet's core. She eventually beats him, and brings Generator C online, and heads to the control room. Samus meets up with the other Hunters. Samus takes the keyboard of the control pad, and then Dark Samus attacks the bounty hunters, but Samus survives, as does the rest of the bounty hunters. The rest of the bounty hunters fall into a coma, while Samus manages to destroy the asteroid with the laser (which is connected to the Generators) before she falls into a coma (a deep sleep) herself.

A month later, Samus finds out that Dark Samus' Phazon(like poison in our world but worse) based attacks have corrupted her. She (along with the rest of the bounty hunters) is fitted with a Phazon Enhancement Device (PED) which allows her to use the Phazon within her. She finds out that her fellow bounty hunters have gone missing. Samus now goes to several planets, named Bryyo, Elysia, and the Pirate Homeworld, where she finds that the inhabitants are all slowly being corrupted by the Phazon. Once Samus finishes that, she lands on planet "Phaaze". Seconds after she lands, Samus's PED Suit is in constant Hyper Mode because Phazze's atmosphere is corrupting her, so she needs to drain all at least 10 energy tanks in order to stay "nonCorrupted" . The meter is her energy tanks filling up. If it reaches the top, Samus dies, or becomes so corrupted that she becomes another Dark Samus. Meanwhile, she finally finds Dark Samus and they fight. Samus wins, then corrupts the problem, and then Phaaze is destroyed.

It turned out that Phazze, a planet, was the source of Dark Samus, as well as the source of all Phazon. It would send meteors called "Leviathan Seeds" to some planets, like it did to Tallon IV and Aether, splitting Aether into "Light Aether" and "Dark Aether". It is made of pure Phazon, with gaseous Phazon for its atmosphere, liquid for its "water", and solid for its ground. With its destruction, all the Phazon in the universe is destroyed, even the Phazon in Samus herself. 

This is the first Metroid game for the Nintendo Wii, and so the controls have been changed to fit the controller. There is also a unique mode, called "Hyper Mode". The player uses the Nunchuk to move and use the grapple, as well as Morph Ball and Lock on. He or she also uses the Wii remote (commonly called Wiimote) for Hypermode, as well as all weaponry and jumping, and aiming.

Cicada

Cicadas are small - and "very" noisy - insects. They are kinds of true bugs.

The noisy buzz they make is the male calling to the female using his panels, called "tymbals", on his sides. When the female, who cannot buzz, hears the buzz of a male, she searches for him. After they mate, the female will use her ovipositor to cut a line into the branch of a tree and lay her eggs there. Adult cicadas usually don't eat anything, and they don't bite. They are usually green or black.Cicadas can also be eaten.It is eaten in countries like China.

Object (computer science)

In Object-oriented programming, an object is an instance of a Class. Objects are an abstraction. They hold both data, and ways to manipulate the data. The data is usually not visible outside the object. It can only be changed by using a well-specified mechanism (usually called "interface").

Suppose there is a bank account; this bank account has a current balance, but it also has a "history" of things that were done. These fields are however not directly accessible. There are methods like "deposit()" and "withdraw()" and "checkBalance()". Most applications (and other objects) only change this object through this interface. 

Banks usually impose a "credit limit". Suppose, there are 1000 dollars on the account. If the client does not have a special agreement with the bank, he cannot take out more money than there is on the account; so he can withdraw() a maximum of 1000 dollars. He might have an agreement with the bank, so he can borrow money from the bank (but has to pay a fee). In that case, he might be able to withdraw 1500 dollars (or 2000 dollars). So the withdraw method has to do a lot of checks as described above.
The account manager might see the account differently, she might have methods to set the maximum amount that can be taken out of the account, or to set the fee or interest rate that the customer has to be pay for the money borrowed.

As an object is an instance of a class; it has certain things from that class. It can perhaps be compared to other objects of that class. Two apples, one red and bigger, the other green and smaller. On the other hand: It is not that easy to compare different objects. A green apple does not have much in common with a steel wrench.

Wikipedia:User access levels

To show a user's access, different "flags" are given to do different tasks on Wikipedia. These flags are given to your account. Some are given automatically, and others must be given manually. A user with a flag is said to belong to that flag's 'user group', giving them certain rights and the access to certain features of the software. The privileges of each user group are shown .

All visitors to the site are potential editors who have not . These editors, and some editors who have created an account but are not , may read all Wikipedia pages (except used by ). They may create new pages, and edit pages that are not .

A user who edits through an account they have registered, may e-mail other users if they activate an email address in their . All logged-in users may mark changes as . They may purge pages without a confirmation step, but are still required to answer a CAPTCHA when adding external links. They may also customize their Wikimedia interface and its options as they wish, via and .
Users automatically get access into the Autoconfirmed/Established users group when their account is four days old.

A number of actions on the English wikipedia are restricted to user accounts which pass certain thresholds for age and editcount: users which meet these requirements are considered part of the pseudo-group autoconfirmed. Autoconfirmed status is checked every time the user performs a restricted action: consequently, it is granted automatically by the software and cannot be removed. The precise requirements for autoconfirmed status varies according to circumstances: for most users on en.wiki, accounts which are more than 4 days old and have made at least 10 edits are considered autoconfirmed.

Autoconfirmed status is required to and edit .

Administrator (also known as "sysops" (system operators)) rights are to users requesting them. Users who are members of the 'administrator' user group have access to the , , buttons, the ability to edit protected pages, the mediawiki interface, and the ability to grant and remove rollback, flood, and ipblock-exempt rights to other users. For a list of admins, please see .

Bureaucrat rights are to trusted users who have already become admins. They have more access to , letting them to add users to the 'sysop' (or use ) and 'bureaucrat' groups (but not remove them), and can add or remove users from the 'bot' user group. They may also use to (including themselves). For a list, please see .

Stewardship is an elected role, and stewards are appointed globally across all Wikimedia Foundation wikis. 

Users who are members of the 'steward' user group may grant and revoke any permission to or from any user on any wiki operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. This group is set on , and may use to set permissions on any wikimedia wiki; they may add or remove any user from any group. Stewards generally act only when there is no user on a particular wiki that can make the necessary change. This includes granting of the 'administrator' or 'bureaucrat' access levels on wikis which do not have any local bureaucrats, and removing such flags if the user resigns or the account is acting maliciously. Stewards are also responsible for granting and revoking access levels such as 'oversight' and 'checkuser', as no other group is capable of making such changes. 

Stewards can also act as checkusers or oversighters on wikis which do not have local members of those groups. If a wiki has a passing need for an edit to be oversighted, for instance, a steward can add themselves to the 'oversight' user group on that wiki, perform the necessary oversight activity using , and then remove themselves from the 'oversight' group using their steward rights. 

All steward actions are logged at . See for a list of users in this group.

Users who are given the rollback flag may revisions using the feature. For a list, please see .

Users who are given the checkuser flag ('checkuser' user group) have access to . They are able to view a list of all IP addresses used by a user account to edit the English wikipedia, a list of all edits made by an IP, or all user accounts that have used an IP address. They may also view a log of such requests. This right is only granted to exceedingly few users who are administrators, age 18+ and have identified themselves to the Wikimedia Foundation.

See for a list of users in this group.

Certain administrators have oversighter access, with access to . Page revisions can be hidden or removed from the public history so they can only be seen by other oversighters and developers. This right is only granted to exceedingly few users who are administrators, age 18+ and have identified themselves to the Wikimedia Foundation.

Transwiki and Importers are unused flags which give permissions on . Although Mediawiki software provides the ability to import articles directly from XML, this is disabled on en.wikipedia as well as most other Wikimedia wiki projects. On en.wikipedia, these flags would only allow access to a disabled page, so they are unused.
For more information on the Import function, see on Meta.

Accounts used by approved to make pre-approved changes can be flagged as such. Bot accounts are automated or semi-automated, the nature of their changes is well defined, and they will be quickly blocked if their actions vary from their given tasks, so they need less scrutiny than human changes.

For this reason, changes from accounts with the bot flag ('' user group) are not displayed in or to users who have opted to hide bot changes. Small changes made by bot accounts to user talk pages do not trigger the banner. Bot accounts can query the API in batches of 5,000 rather than 500.

See for a list of users in this group.

There are a number of development areas of some sort to which access is limited, which are not specific to any particular wiki. SVN commit access allows the development version of the MediaWiki software to be modified, toolserver access allows applications to be uploaded to and run on the , and a small number of people have shell access to the servers on which Wikipedia and the other projects of the Wikimedia Foundation are hosted. 

Several of the Wikimedia developers with root access to the wikimedia servers are granted permissions without using the normal approval channels, as the rights they infer are merely safer or more efficient alternatives to modifying the database directly. For instance, , , and have 'steward' rights although they were not .

The 'developer' user group exists on all Wikimedia projects, but it is not usually populated. If a developer needs access to a specific permission on wikipedia, they can assign the permission to the 'developer' group, then add themselves to the group using steward rights. Permissions which have been assigned to the 'developer' group include siteadmin, which enables them to rename users with more than 200,000 edits.

A (usually empty) list of users in the 'developer' group can be found at . 

The 'founder' group was created on the English Wikipedia by developer Tim Starling, as a unique group for , co-founder of Wikipedia. The group gives Wales full access to and . As Wales is also a steward on Meta, he has the ability to change the user rights of any editor on any wikimedia wiki from , making the 'founder' group largely a status symbol. However, as "founder actions" are usually of great interest to the local community, and are only relevant to the English Wikipedia, the 'founder' right also has the benefit of allowing Wales' actions to be visible in the en.wiki rights log; actions performed with the steward bit are not visible in that record, but only on the .

Object-oriented design

Object-Oriented Design (OOD) is a way for the designer of a computer program to specify what a computer program will do, using the way that people think and not using the way that computers think. People think in terms of classes and objects. For example, fruit is a class, and there are different kinds of fruits such as bananas and pineapples. If a computer program designer were specifying to a computer programmer how to create a computer program to manage the fruits in a supermarket, then he or she would specify the program in terms of classes and objects which is how people think.

A computer program called a compiler and/or an interpreter would take the program that the programmer typed in and convert it into a form that a computer can run. Computers really only understand things that are encoded as numbers. Object-Oriented-Design (OOD) uses the power and speed of a computer to allow humans to be more productive in making computer programs, by letting human computer programmers think in terms of how humans think.

For a long time, he was a fugitive (running from the law), from 1995 until July 21, 2008. The International Criminal Court in The Hague looked for him. They say he might have committed war crimes. 

Official sources in Belgrade reported that he had been arrested in Serbia and brought before Belgrade's War Crimes Court. There had been an international arrest warrant against Karadžić for more than a decade. The tribunal looking into war crimes in the Yugoslav war said there were reasons to believe Karadžić had committed war crimes. This includes genocide, mainly directed against Muslims. The United States government had offered a $5 million award for information that led to his arrest, and that of Ratko Mladić. Karadžić was arrested and arraigned at a Serbian court on July 21, 2008.

Cus D'Amato was born in 1908 in Bronx, New York to an Italian family of immigrants. He was one of eight brothers. In his childhood he wanted to become a boxer like his big brother Jerry. However, at 12 years old he took part in the fight and became blind in one eye.

Auerswald was feared by the prisoners due to his brutality. Executions and brutal punishments made him one of the most terrible guards at Mauthausen. 

After the end of World War II Auerswald was charged by an US-military tribunal in Dachau. The trial document lists a case where a Russian prisoner, begging for his life, was pushed by Auerswald into a fence secured by high voltage. He died immediately. The documentation also mentioned that 300 healthy prisoners were brought from Mauthausen to the sub-camp St. Aegyd. More than 50% died within the next few weeks or became severely sick so that they were brought back to Mauthausen where they died. Auerswald was the head of the St. Aegyd sub-camp at that time.

Auerswald was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. Later it was changed to life imprisonment.

Battle of Berlin

The Battle of Berlin was one of the last big battles of Second World War. The Battle took place in Berlin from 16 April to 3 May 1945. During the battle the Red Army, along with Polish forces, captured the city of Berlin, Germany. When they captured the Reichstag, Adolf Hitler commited suicide by shooting himself in the face.

On 12 January 1945 the Soviet-Polish forces began attacking Berlin. In the end of that attack, their forces stood on the Oder River, 60 kilometres east of Berlin. In 1945 the Wehrmacht suffered from low quality of airplanes and tanks (lower quality from 1944).

Despite his advisors' opinion, Hitler decided to stay in the city. He heard about the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt on the radio and he hoped the city will be saved.

The battle on the city began in the Seelow Heights. The Seelow Heights are 17 kilometers west of the Oder and 45 kilometres east of Berlin. They were well defended by the "Wehrmacht". On 16 April, the Red Army and Polish Army attacked Seelow Heights. Almost 1,000,000 allies with 20,000 artillery pieces were fighting against 100,000 Germans with 1,200 tanks. Despite this, the German defenders managed to hold the allies for four days.

On 20 April, Hitler's birthday, the allies began to bombard the centre of the city with rockets and artillery. They did not stop until the city surrendered. On 22 April, Hitler, when he knew the Germans plans were interrupted, cried in anger. He knew the war was as good as lost. One of his generals, Alfred Jodl, thought it would be possible to form a linkup between the army in Berlin, and the soldiers commanded by Walther Wenck that were fighting the U.S. Army. Hitler agreed to this idea, but 10 German troops remained in the city. 

Hitler remained in the Führerbunker until his death. He knew that escape was nearly impossible. Other soldiers knew that too and wanted to get out. Since there was no hope of winning, Hitler gave orders to his generals and allowed a breakout plan on April 28th. However, this plan went bad, as only a small amount of the expected amount of soldiers managed to get through Soviet lines. Hitler authorized another one on April 29th to break out May 1st.

However, on April 30th the Red Army captured the Reichstag. They were just 500 yards from the Führerbunker. Hitler killed himself by shooting himself in the face with a pistol. Eva Braun, his mistress, killed "herself" by biting on a capsule of cyanide, a very toxic chemical. On May 1st, Helmuth Weidling ordered a break out. However, only one division, named the "Nordland" Division, made it through.

Finally, on May 2, 1945, Nazi Germany surrendered.

Alpaca

The Alpaca ("Vicugna pacos") is a domesticated species of South American camelid. It resembles a small llama in superficial appearance.

General information about alpacas

The home of the alpacas: Chile, Peru and Bolivia in South America. A landscape those the sea, grassland and mountains in special beauty interconnects. Here the alpacas were domesticate by the Incas, and bred from Vicuña and Guanaco before approx. 5000 years
Alpacas belong to the new world camelids such as lamas, vicuñas and guanacos. In the whole world there are about 3 million alpacas. Of it ever approx. 30000 in Australia and North America, 6000 in England and 2000 in Germany.
They can get about 20 to 25 years old and the stick measure is approx. 80 to 100 cm. Their body weight is attained full growth with 60 to 75 kg and the wool production for each to alpaca lies at present with approximately 3 to 6 kg in the year. Alpacas are in Germany as agricultural utilizable animals recognized since 1996. It is not necessary to have a special proof to be owner or for breeding them in Germany.
Grace in the summer and hay in the winter is the main source of food for alpacas. By the hard conditions in their homeland they are better excellent fodder-worth, than other utilizable animals.
The Alpaca wool is worldwide very desired by the textile industry. The fibre ranks beside Kashmir and silk among the noblest natural fibres. Softness, refinement and an indescribable gloss made it so desired. Today we find more than 22 natural colours of the alpaca fibre. The colour plate reaches from a deep black, brown, grey or rose grey up to pure white. The positive trend on the part of the textile industry and the consumer, natural and uncoloured wool too received, continued to advance the breed of collared animals over the last years
Babies are called crias, the females hembras and the males machos. And in such a way behave it self macho - the males also now and then. These terms are coming original from the Spanish language.
Alpacas are very tough and durable. In the southern part of South America they are suspended extreme climatic conditions. So they are to be adjusted it used still on the same day high plus and also for temperatures below freezing. Our moderate climate makes thereby no demands and the here living Alpacas.
Care of Alpacas is not a particularly difficult chapter. By there small visible size they are to be kept very simple under control. Special care expenditure is not necessary, but annual shearing, worming, inoculating and the regular cut the foot nails already belong to the tasks. Also good control of the teeth and the entire appearance is advisable. Alpacas are not susceptible at all to diseases.
Crias, babies are born annually. A female carries about 11.5 months and gets usually in each case a cria. Newborn children weigh approx. 8 kg. The raising rate in our widths is with approx. 90%. In the countries of origin of South America only around 33%. Short time after the birth is running the newborn cria and nurse by the mother. The birth takes place at daylight, mostly in the morning in the protection of the herd, so that the cria is warmed and dried by the sun. After approximately 2-3 weeks is again ready to breed to take up and lets so the male again grant, what is possible the whole year over.
There are two kinds of alpacas, the huacaya and the suri; where by only about 4% of the world population are suris. With the huacaya the skin has one crimps similarly the merino sheep. Suris against it have smooth skin of which in curls down hang.

Alpacas are friendly and good-natured natures. They do not spit after humans. They are intelligently, curious and affectionate. These gentle characteristics and their reassuring kind, love also children very the joy fast special at handling alpacas find. Alpacas are herd animals; therefore one should hold at least 2 animals.
Alpacas are very watchful, too. They oppose aggressors, as hunting dogs or foxes, effectively. Without shyness they lower their head and do not signal defence-understand, it can get already times a violent kick set. For this reason alpacas go along also in other countries as watchers, for example from herds of sheep on journey.
Alpacas converse also with one another. By different body attitudes and a multiplicity of different sounds. But their gentle, nearly already graceful humming makes it so indescribably love worth.
Pastures live are for alpacas in and everything. So they can normally be the whole year over outside. They love it then an airy shelter to visit to be able. One bathing place with fine sand, for the wool and skin cleaning becomes several times on the day the popular playing field of the herd. The fence are enough one 1.50 m of high. This fence is more to protect them self.
Alpacas are walking like camels. Compared with cows, horses or sheep they do not damage the soil on that them move. Since they do not pluck additionally with food intake, but the points purposefully graze, are them excellent landscape or dyke male nurse. The grass scar is not hurt and sensitive dams are not damaged.
Alpacas are an extraordinary part of nature and as production for the harmonious keeping of domestic cattle.

About 5,000 to 6,000 years ago the natives began the 
domestication of the vicuna into the present day alpaca as a fiber 
producing animal.

Mennonites

The Mennonites are a group of Christian Anabaptists named after Menno Simons (1496–1561). His teachings were a relatively minor influence on the group, though. They are of the historic "peace churches". Mennonites are committed to nonviolence, nonviolent resistance/reconciliation, and pacifism.

There are about 1.5 million Mennonites worldwide as of 2006. There are many different types of mennonite communities in the world. There are those that dress in old-fashioned ways, and others which are hard to tell apart from other people leading a modern lifestyle. Most Mennonites are in the United States and Democratic Republic of Congo, but Mennonites can also be found in tight-knit communities in at least 51 countries on six continents or scattered amongst the populace of those countries.

Mennonites have an international distinction among Christian denominations in disaster relief. They also place a strong theological emphasis on voluntary service. Mennonite Disaster Service, based in North America, provides both immediate and long-term responses to hurricanes, floods, and other disasters. Mennonite Central Committee provides disaster relief around the world alongside their long-term international development programs. Other programs offer a variety of relief efforts and services throughout the world.

In the last few decades some Mennonite groups have also become more actively involved with peace and social justice issues, helping to found Christian Peacemaker Teams and Mennonite Conciliation Service.

Hutterites are a group of Protestanŧ Christians. They are an anabaptist movement; they think believers should be baptized (a second time). Their movement was founded by Jacob Hutter who lived in the 16th century. The main difference to the Mennonites is that they think the Bible should be read literally. They also share everything they have; there is no private property.

Today, there are about 50.000 Hutterites; most of them live in the Canada and the United States. Like the Amish they still speak a dialect of German.

Acronis True Image

Acronis True Image is a program to make disk images. It is made by Acronis. True Image can create an image of a disk while it is running Microsoft Windows or Linux, or offline by booting from CD/DVD, USB flash drives, PXE, or other bootable media. As a disk imaging solution, True Image can restore the previously captured image to another disk, effectively replicating the structure and contents to the new disk, also allowing partition resizing if the new disk is of different capacity.

File systems supported by software:

In addition to the officially supported filesystems, Acronis True Image also provides raw sector backup and restore options for all other filesystems. 'Raw' mode provides support for a file system that is corrupt, or that is not officially supported, by capturing a complete image of all sectors on the disk. This method results in a larger image file as it is not able to compress, resize, or selectively restore files on the unrecognized filesystem.

The Young Ones

The Young Ones is a popular British sitcom, first seen in 1982, on BBC2. Its anarchic sense of humour, in the 1980s, made the actors famous in the UK. Soon after that, it was shown to Americans on MTV, one of the first shows on the new channel that was not mostly about music.

The programme was about four college students sharing a house: violent punk rocker Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), the stuck-up anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), the suffering hippy Neil (Nigel Planer), and the mysterious Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also starred Alexei Sayle, who played their landlord, Jerzei Balowski, and other members of the Balowski family. 

The show was like a regular sitcom, with violent slapstick, silly turns in the plot, and surrealism. 

Although the series was set in North London, many outdoors scenes were filmed in Bristol. All four characters went to the fictional "Scumbag College", but they were never shown in a classroom, and were hardly ever seen studying.

The show was voted #31 in the BBC's Best Sitcom poll in 2004.

The series' beginnings were in London's comedy clubs in the late 1970s. Most of the cast became popular at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the main act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive Master of ceremonies. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as a double act, 20th Century Coyote, and later became The Dangerous Brothers). Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits." 

As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in nearby Soho. The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy clubs in London, and one person who liked it a lot was Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then made a deal for six half-hour shows on Channel 4, using the group as comedy actors instead of stand-up performers.

The first of this series, "The Comic Strip Presents...", was on Channel 4 on 2 November 1982. After this, the BBC made a deal with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in another sitcom in the same style. Paul Jackson was put in as a producer. 

The series was written by Mayall with his girlfriend Lise Mayer, and with Ben Elton (who went to Manchester University with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was first going to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.

The series was centered around the unclean house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College.

When it was first on television, the show got attention for violent slapstick. Though new to mainstream audiences, Mayall and Edmondson had been using it in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also had some very strange parts, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with pieces in the middle that were not part of the main plot.

Episodes in the second series sometimes had "flash frames" (three frames, lasting 1/8 of a second), but these were cut out of some repeats. They were included to make fun of the British and American public's fear of subliminal messages in television and music. The images included the words "Carry On Cowboy" (the name of a 1965 film), a rusty dripping tap, a leaping frog, a dove in flight, a skier, and a hand making pottery.

The episodes ran 35 minutes, and many episodes were cut when repeated on the BBC or satellite channels.

In the United States, "The Young Ones" ran on PBS, MTV and, in 1994, on Comedy Central.

The series' theme song featured the cast singing Cliff Richard and The Shadows UK #1 song "The Young Ones". Throughout the series there were many references to Richard, as Mayall's character was a fan. 

The theme song over the end credits was written by Peter Brewis, who also created incidental music on many episodes.

In 1984, after the second season, Planer (in character as Neil) reached No. 2 in the UK charts with a version of Traffic's "Hole In My Shoe". It went with "Neil's Heavy Concept Album", a loose collection of songs and spoken comedy with appearances by "Young Ones" actors Dawn French and Stephen Fry.

In 1986, the cast sang "Living Doll" with Cliff Richard and Hank Marvin for Comic Relief. The song, a reworking of his 1959 hit, reached the top of the UK Charts.

Most episodes had a musical guest performing in the house or street. By including the groups, the show could be called variety rather than light entertainment by the BBC and was given a bigger budget than a sitcom. This also helped get several British bands to be more popular with American viewers, such as Dexys Midnight Runners, Motörhead, and Madness. This last group was in two episodes.

Some of these performances were cut from the DVD for copyright reasons. Some musical acts were also cut out for similar reasons on some satellite reruns. 

Played by Nigel Planer, Neil Pye, the hippy, is a clinically depressed, suicidal pacifist, vegetarian and environmentalist working towards a Peace Studies degree. He is victimised by other housemates (especially Rick and Vyvyan) and forced to do the housework, including shopping, cleaning and cooking. He is never acknowledged for it (unless it goes wrong). 

Neil is pessimistic and believes everyone and everything hates him, which is mostly true, though he does have some friends, two hippys, one also named Neil and one named Warlock. He does not like technology except for videos, and he speaks out for Vegetable Rights and Peace. He is also an insomniac, believing that "sleep gives you cancer". 

Neil wants the others to feel sorry for him, or just acknowledge his presence. To get attention, he tries anything from repeatedly banging himself on the head with a frying pan to attempting suicide. He claims "the most interesting thing that ever happens to me is sneezing". 

In the second series, his parents - who appear in the episode "Sick" - are revealed to be upper middle class. They are conservative Tories who look down on Neil.

Neil also says 'heavy' a lot.

Played by Rik Mayall, Rick is an anarchist who is studying sociology and/or domestic sciences (depending on the episode). Rick writes poetry and calls himself "The People's Poet".

Rick is a hypocritical, tantrum-throwing attention-seeker who loves Cliff Richard. Rick tries to impress the others with what he thinks is his wit, talent and humour, but is really none of these. He insults and often physically assaults Neil. He fights and bickers with Vyvyan, and attempts to impress Mike.

Rick is a vegetarian, and says he wishes everyone to love each other like brothers. However, he rarely does anything that can be called brotherly love. 

Rick is unlikeable, and so selfish that he believes he is the "most popular member of the flat" even though his housemates really hate him. Vyvyan describes Rick's name as being spelled "with a silent P". Although the other members dislike and ignore Rick, he is heard to say that they "really are terrific friends".
Believing himself the 'People's Poet' or the "spokesperson for a generation", Rick exaggerates or lies about his political activism and working class background, and in the last episode "Summer Holiday", it is suggested he really comes from an upper class, Conservative background.

While he sees himself as an anarchist, he likes the ideas of Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky and states his interest in them in several episodes. However, he claims to dislike Margaret Thatcher, as is noted by his efforts threatening to blow up England with a bomb in the episode "Bomb" if she does not do something "to help the kids, by this afternoon." This is also noticed in "The Young Ones Book," first published by Sphere Books, where negative references are made to Thatcher and the Conservative Party.
Rick speaks loudly and cannot pronounce his "r"s sometimes.

Played by Adrian Edmondson, Vyvyan is an orange-haired, mohican punk rocker and medical student. He is extremely violent and regularly attacks Neil and Rick with pieces of wood, cricket bats and other large objects. He never hurts Mike, whom he respects. He hates Rick more than he does Neil, taking every chance to insult and attack him. For example, when Rick, Mike and Neil meet his mother at a bar in the episode "Boring", he calls both Neil and Mike his friends, but not Rick, whom he calls "a complete bastard." Although Rick and Vyvyan hate each other, this makes them all but inseparable; the two spend more time together than apart, or with the other housemates. 

Vyvyan owns a yellow Ford Anglia, with red flames painted along the sides, and a Glaswegian hamster named Special Patrol Group ("SPG" for short) which he is very fond of, even though SPG is also often subjected to Vyvyan's extreme violence. His mother is a barmaid and former shoplifter, who before "Boring" had not seen Vyvyan in ten years and has no idea who his father is.

Vyvyan has inhuman strength on occasion (moving entire walls with his bare hands, lifting Neil above his head in a fight with Rick, biting through a brick and even re-attaching his own head after it was cut off), surviving a pick-axe through the head, and he eats just about anything; televisions, dead rats, cornflakes, or cornflakes with ketchup. 

Although he is a homicidal maniac, Vyvyan can be friendly and creative; in one episode ("Flood"), he made his own potion to change a person into an axe-wielding homicidal maniac. He has more friends than the others but "he doesn't like any of them." He often causes damage such as wiring the doorbell to a bomb, and adding a 289 CID Ford V-8 engine to the vacuum cleaner, which proceeds to suck up the carpet, the floorboards and a friend of Neil's. Vyvyan also seems to be the only member of the group with a driving licence.

Played by Christopher Ryan, Mike was the oddest of the four. He is the assumed leader of the group, despite being rather shorter than the others, and does not involve himself in the battles between the other three. He makes puns, which are either deliberately cheap or humorous.

He often uses deep-sounding phrases that confuse the others (for example, when asked by Rick if he stole his apple, Mike replies "Well, if you're gonna sin you might as well be original."). Mike is supposedly the ladies' man of the bunch, and brags about his prowess with women, although he is eventually forced to admit his virginity to the others in "Nasty." Though he is a virgin, as are the rest of the housemates, he always tries to get a date with the opposite sex, being quite forward and unsuccessful.

A con artist, he always has some kind of plan to make quick money, such as renting out Rick's bedroom as a roller disco, and trying to auction off the unexploded atom bomb that fell into the house. Mike attends Scumbag College only in name, as he has blackmailed his tutor and the Dean of the school for grants, and apparently passing grades. In "Summer Holiday" he says "I think I'll ask for one of those Ph.D.s next year."

While Mike often does things at the expense of his housemates, he usually does not show the sort of open hostility that the others do, and seems to cause them trouble only when it benefits him. He has, however, managed to nail his own legs to a table, and accidentally knocked Neil out during a game of cricket. We only see violence done to him once or twice (at the end of the "Living Doll" video, when Vyvyan knocks him unconscious with a hammer and in "Summer Holiday", when Neil transforms into the Incredible Hulk, who picks up Mike and throws him to the ground, however it turns out it was only Neil's imagination).

Throughout the two series, Alexei Sayle regularly appeared as many different characters, putting his own material into the programme in ways that copied his stand up comedy routines. His main role was that of the flat's landlord Jerzy (Jeremy) Balowski, appearing in "Demolition", "Flood" and "Summer Holiday". The rest of the time, he played various male members of "The Balowski Family", including nephew Alexei Balowski (a protest singer), son Reggie Balowski (an international arms dealer), brother Billy Balowski (a lunatic who believed he was a taxi driver), cousin Tommy Balowski (a drunk), escaped convict Brian Damage Balowski, and a medieval jester "Jester Balowski" (with Helen Lederer as his sidekick).

In the second series, Sayle's characters also included a train driver, a Mussolini look-alike (by day the head of the local police force, by night an entrant in the Eurovision Song Contest), and "Harry the Bastard" (manager of the local Rumbelows store, disguised as a South African vampire).

Mike is the natural "leader" of the house. Always trying to make himself appear more important and exciting than he really is, he does appear to have done some of the things he claims to have done (such as getting Bambi the "Babycham" commercial in "Bambi"). He gets little hostility from the other members of the house. If there is any good or friendly relationship in the house it is between Mike and Vyvyan. Vyvyan accepts Mike's role as the house leader, whereas Mike sometimes uses Vyvyan's muscles and willingness to act forcibly, to enforce his own authority.

Neil is the second least liked of the four, although he is the only one who does any kind of household chores and is therefore needed by the other three.

Rick is the least liked. Rick thinks very highly of himself. He tells poor jokes and stories (but finds them hilarious himself), is a wanna-be anarchist (although deep-down he is quite conservative) and frequently acts like a child when he does not get his way. He generally takes out his frustration (when trying to impress the others) on Neil, since Neil never sticks up for himself and is ignored by the others. However, the one time when Neil looked as if he was going to retaliate, Rick fled. Most of his anger comes up in his endless battles with Vyvyan, which he always loses.

In the final episode, the four students steal a red AEC Routemaster after robbing a bank, only to drive it over a cliff, and it explodes into flames at the bottom of a quarry.

The end of the series was not the last appearance of "The Young Ones". For the British charity television appeal Comic Relief, the four recorded a song and video for Cliff Richard's "Living Doll", along with Richard and Shadows guitarist Hank B. Marvin. (Alexei Sayle was not involved, but had already achieved chart success in 1984 with "'Ullo John, Gotta New Motor?".) At the 1986 Comic Relief stage show, they performed the song live. 

Mayall, Planer and Edmondson reunited in 1986 for the Elton-written "Filthy Rich & Catflap". The series had many of the same characteristics as "The Young Ones" as did Mayall and Edmondson's next sitcom "Bottom". Ryan, for his part, was regularly recruited to play roles on associated series (such as "Happy Families", "Bottom" and "Absolutely Fabulous").

DVD releases have been somewhat basic: only the U.S. "Every Stoopid Episode" edition featured documentaries, and no extra footage was included. Musical references proved difficult to clear, so "The Sound of Silence" and "Subterranean Homesick Blues" were cut from the U.S. editions. 

A new DVD release of all episodes ("Extra Stoopid Edition") came out in November of 2007, with new documentaries and two commentary tracks. . This edition restores "The Sound of Silence" and "Subterranean Homesick Blues," but is missing other scenes. 

In 1986 MTV bought half the episodes to run on their cable systems during 1987.

Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte

Napoléon III, also known as Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte(1808 - 1873) was the first President of the French Republic and the last monarch of France. Made president by popular vote in 1848, Napoleon III ascended to the throne on 2 December 1852, the forty-eighth anniversary of his uncle, Napoleon I's, coronation. He ruled as Emperor of the French until September 1870, when he was captured in the Franco-Prussian War. 

Napoleon III, generally known as "Louis Napoléon" before he became emperor, was the son of Louis Bonaparte, who married Hortense de Beauharnais, the daughter by the first marriage of Napoleon's wife Josephine de Beauharnais. During Napoleon I's reign, Louis-Napoléon's parents had been made king and queen of a French puppet state, the Kingdom of Holland. After Napoleon I's military defeats and deposition in 1815 and the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France, all members of the Bonaparte dynasty were forced into exile. He was quietly exiled to the United States of America, and spent four years in New York. He also sailed to Central America. Then he secretly returned to France and attempted yet another coup in August 1840, sailing with some hired soldiers into Boulogne. In 1844, his uncle Joseph died, making him the direct heir apparent to the Bonaparte claim. Two years later, his father Louis died, making Louis-Napoléon the clear Bonapartist candidate to rule France. 

Louis-Napoléon lived within the borders of the United Kingdom until the revolution of February 1848 in France deposed Louis-Philippe and established a Republic. He was now free to return to France, which he immediately did. 

In 1848, he was elected President of France in a land slide victory. He won the election because of his popular name and French people hoped that he would return his uncle's glory. He used his rank as stepping stone to greater power. Finally in 1852, he crowned himself as Emperor Napoleon III and the Second French Empire was born.In 1856, Eugenie gave birth to a legitimate son and heir, Louis Napoléon, the Prince Impérial. 

On 28 April 1855 Napoleon survived an attempted assassination. On 14 January 1858 Napoleon and his wife escaped another assassination attempt, plotted by Felice Orsini.
Until about 1861, Napoleon's regime exhibited decidedly authoritarian characteristics, using press censorship to prevent the spread of opposition, manipulating elections, and depriving the Parliament of the right to free debate or any real power.

A far more dangerous threat to Napoleon, however, was looming. France saw its dominance on the continent of Europe eroded by Prussia's crushing victory over Austria in the Austro-Prussian War in June–August 1866. The Prussian forces under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck then began the Franco-Prussian War This war proved disastrous for France, and was instrumental in giving birth to the German Empire, which would take France's place as the major land power on the continent of Europe. In battle against Prussia in 1870 the Emperor was captured at the Battle of Sedan and was deposed by the forces of the Third Republic in Paris two days later.

Napoleon spent the last few years of his life in exile in England, with Eugenie and their only son. The family lived at Camden Place Chislehurst (then in Kent), where he died on 9 January 1873. He was haunted to the end by bitter regrets and by painful memories of the battle at which he lost everything.

Napoleon was originally buried at St. Mary's, the Catholic Church in Chislehurst. However, after his son died in 1879 fighting in the British Army against the Zulus in South Africa, the bereaved Eugenie decided to build a monastery. The building would house monks driven out of France by the anti-religious laws of the Third Republic, and would provide a suitable resting place for her husband and son. 

An important legacy of Napoleon III's reign was the rebuilding of Paris. Part of the design decisions were taken in order to reduce the ability of future revolutionaries to challenge the government by capitalizing on the small, medieval streets of Paris to form barricades. However, this should not overshadow the fact that the main reason for the complete transformation of Paris was Napoleon III's desire to modernize Paris based on what he had seen of the modernizations of London during his exile there in the 1840s.

Saint Joseph

Saint Joseph, it says in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke, was engaged to a young woman named Mary. 

The Gospel of Luke says that at this time, the angel Gabriel came to Mary to tell her that she would give birth to a Son and she should call him Jesus and that he would save people from their sins. Mary said "How can this happen? I am a virgin!" The angel said "With God, anything can happen!"

When Joseph found out that Mary was pregnant, he decided to privately break the engagement. But then he had a dream. An angel told him that the baby was "the Son of God". 

At this time, the Roman Emperor, Caesar Augustus, made a law that everyone in the Roman Empire must pay tax. Everyone had to go back to the town that their family came from, to have their name put on the tax lists. Joseph came from Bethlehem, which was called "The City of David". Joseph took Mary to Bethlehem and she gave birth to the baby, Jesus, in a stable, because there was no room for them.

Oneness Pentecostalism is a Protestant Christian movement. The movement split from the Pentecostal movement. Followers believe that the bible should be read literally. They believe in one god, and reject ideas like the Trinity. They believe Jesus is fully god and fully human. This makes them different from most Unitarians who say that the son of god was only man. Oneness Pentecostalists say the belief in the Trinity is really the belief in three different gods.

Seventh-Day Adventist Church

The Seventh-day Adventist (abbreviated "Adventist") Church is a Protestant Christian group. It is different from other groups mainly because its followers think that Saturday, the original seventh day of the Judeo-Christian week, should be the Sabbath. The movement grew out of the Millerite movement in the United States during the middle part of the 19th century and was formally established in 1863. Among its founders was Ellen G. White. She wrote many texts that are still considered very important to the church today.

Much of the theology of the Seventh-day Adventist church is the same as evangelical teachings such as the Trinity and the infallibility of Scripture. Teachings that are different include the unconscious state of the dead and the doctrine of an investigative judgment. The church is also known because it thinks a healthy diet is very important. It also promotes religious liberty. When it comes to culture, it is more conservative.

The world church is governed by a General Conference. Smaller regions are administered by divisions, union conferences and local conferences. It currently has a worldwide membership of over 15 million people. It is present in over 200 countries and territories and is ethnically and culturally diverse. The church runs many schools, hospitals and publishing houses worldwide, as well as a prominent humanitarian aid organization known as the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA).

There are about 15.5 million people in the Seventh-day adventist church worldwide.

Linux kernel

Linux is an operating system kernel used by a group of Unix-like operating systems. These are known as Linux operating systems. 

The Linux kernel is released with the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) and developed by programmers worldwide.

In April 1991, Linus Torvalds, then 21 years old, started working on some simple ideas for an operating system. Then, on 25 August 1991, Torvalds posted to "comp.os.minix":

After the post, many people contributed code to the project. By September 1991, Linux version 0.01 was released. It had 10,239 lines of code. In October 1991, Linux version 0.02 was released.

A newsgroup "alt.os.linux" was started, and on January 19 1992, the first post to alt.os.linux was made. On March 31 1992, alt.os.linux became "comp.os.linux".

The X Window System was soon moved to Linux. In March 1992, Linux version 0.95 was the first to be capable of running X. This large version number jump (from 0.1x to 0.9x) was because of a feeling that a version 1.0 with no major missing parts would be released soon. 

On March 14 1994, Linux 1.0.0 was released, with 176,250 lines of code. In March 1995, Linux 1.2.0 was released (310,950 lines of code).

Linus decided, on May 9 1996, to adopt Tux the penguin as mascot for Linux.

Version 2 of Linux, released on June 9, 1996, was a landmark. Strong development continued:

Currently a new kernel version is released in every 2 3/4 months. 

In the start, Torvalds released Linux under a license which did not allow anyone to sell it. This was soon changed to the GNU General Public License (GPL), during version 0.12. This license allows distribution and sale of modified and unmodified versions of Linux but requires that all those copies be released under the same license and be accompanied by the complete corresponding source code. 

Torvalds has said licensing Linux under the GPL as the "best thing I ever did."

Sara Evans

Sara Evans (born February 5, 1971) is a traditional country singer born in Boonville, Missouri. She has had several #1 hits, gold albums and platinum albums.

Music was a big part of her life when she was young. At age 8, she was hit by a car in front of her house and broke both of her legs. She spent months in a wheelchair and kept singing to pay her hospital bills.

At age 16, she began performing in a nightclub in Columbia, Missouri. She did this for two years. At age 20, she moved to Nashville, Tennessee because she wanted to be a country music singer. She met musician Craig Schelske there. A year later, they moved to Oregon, but when they married, they moved back to Nashville.

In 1995, Sara began recording demos. Someone named Harland Howard was impressed by them so much he decided to help her get a contract. This paid off when she signed with RCA Records.

Her first album under RCA was called "Three Chords and the Truth", released in 1997. People liked it for being traditional, and it was in many Top 10 lists for that year.

However, country music radio didn't like it that much. None of the singles made the Top 40.

In 1998, Sara released her next album, "No Place That Far". People didn't like it because it was more of a pop-country sound. The first single (Cryin' Game) didn't do anything, but the next single (No Place That Far, a duet with Vince Gill) became a #1 hit. Because of that the album was certified gold.

<doc id="120792" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=120792" title="Pay-per-view">
Pay-per-view

Pay-per-view (often abbreviated PPV) is a way that people can pay to watch events on television in their homes. The event is shown at the same time to everyone ordering it. This is different than video on demand systems which lets people see the event at any time. Common events include movies, sporting events, and pornographic movies.

The first major pay-per-view event was on September 16, 1981. This event was Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas "Hitman" Hearns boxing for the Welterweight Championship. Viacom Cablevision in Nashville, Tennessee, was the first system to offer the event. Over fifty percent of its customers paid to see the fight. Viacom's Marketing Director, Pat Thompson, put together the fight. He later put together other PPV fights, wrestling matches, and even a Broadway play.

After leaving Viacom, Thompson became head of Sports View. He produced the first pay-per-view football game on October 16, 1983. Sports View was important in creating pay-per-view networks. It was a part of creating TigerVision for LSU, TideVision for Alabama, and UT Vol Seat for Tennessee. Sports View also produced the Ohio State-Michigan Football game on PPV in November of 1983.

In 1985, the first U.S. cable channels to show only pay-per-view, "Viewers Choice", "Cable Video Store", and "Request TV" began operation within days of each other. Viewers Choice was available to both home satellite dish and cable customers. Request TV was available to only cable viewers at first. Dish owners could not use it until the 1990s.

The term "pay-per-view" became more well known in the 1990s when companies like iN DEMAND, HBO, and Showtime started using it to show movies and other things. In Demand would show movies, concerts, and other events at prices between $3.99 to $49.99. HBO and Showtime would offer championship boxing, with prices between $14.99 to $54.99.

Pay-per-view is also a very important way for professional wrestling companies like World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) , Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) , Ring of Honor (ROH) and Asistencia Asesoría y Administración to earn money.

The first pay-per-view system tested in the United states was the Zenith Phonevision system. In 1949, it used telephone lines to take and receive orders. The telephone lines were also used to descramble the signal on the television. Tests were run for 90 days in Chicago. In 1950, Skiatron tested its system on WOR in New York City. The system used IBM punch cards to descramble the signal. Both systems showed that they could be used but were not allowed to be used by the FCC.

One of the first pay-per-view systems on cable was the Optical Systems. It was first used in 1972 in San Diego. These early systems quickly went out of business, as the cable industry started using satellite technology. This caused systems, for example Home Box Office, which had people pay a constant amount of money each month to became popular.

Pay-per-view was first used in the United Kingdom with the use of satellite television and cable systems.

Pay-per-view was first used by Foxtel to home television in Australia and New Zealand in the early 2000s. Sky Pacific in Fiji and other Pacific Island Nations started using it in 2006.

Dhaka District

Dacca District (ঢাকা জেলা) is a district located in the centre of Bangladesh. The district is part of the Dhaka Division, more than half of the district is made up of Dacca - the capital of the district and of Bangladesh too.

Dhaka has a very old history, the city area of Dhaka was ruled by the Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms century. 

After the Sena dynasty, Dhaka was ruled first by the Turkish and the Afghan governors from the Delhi Sultanate before the arrival of the Mughals in 1608.

During the rule of the Mughal the district was famous for its textile products - especially the Muslin. The Mughal governor Islam Khan was the first administrator of the city. Khan named the town "Jahangir Nagar" ("City of Jahangir") in honour of the Mughal emperor Jahangir, although this name was dropped soon after Jahangir's death.

The city grew in size quite a lot under Mughal general Shaista Khan. The city then measured 19 by 13 kilometres (12 by 8 mi), with a population of nearly a million people. The city then passed to the control of the British East India Company in 1765 after the Battle of Plassey. The number of people in the city fell very much as the prominence of Kolkata rose, but development eventually followed. A modern civic water supply system was introduced in 1874 and electricity supply launched in 1878. The Dhaka Cantonment was established near the city, serving as a base for British and Indian soldiers.

Proprietary software

Proprietary (or closed source) software does not let people see or change source code of the computer software. It is the opposite of Free software. Proprietary software is usually created by businesses who want to sell their software, but some programs that are free to use are still proprietary because the user is not allowed to change them. With proprietary software, only the people that make the software can see and change the code.

Even if the people who make the program give the source code to other people, the program will be proprietary if they do not allow to do important things like these:

Most companies who sell their software for money (and even some who do not charge money for it) make it proprietary source. This makes it harder for people to copy or change the software, or to take the source code and make similar software.

<doc id="120808" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=120808" title="Kala Dhaka">
Kala Dhaka

Kala Dhaka which also used to known as the Black Mountain of Hazara is a mountain range and a tribal area of Mansehra District on the north-western Hazara border of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.

Kala Dhaka lies next to Agror to the east by Tanawal to the south, the range has a length of 25 to 30 miles from north to south and a height of 8,000 feet above sea-level. The river Indus goes through the most northern but and then moves to the south. Between the river and the top of the range the western areas are occupied by the Yusufzai Pathans tribe. The rest of the range is held by another tribe - the Swatis. The Black Mountain has long narrow ridges with higher peaks every now and again. It also has valleys in which there are villages where the tribes live. The upper parts of the ridge are covered with thick forests of pine, oak, sycamore, horse-chestnut, and wild cherry; but the slopes are stony and barren.

The British sent armies more than four times to try and control the Black Mountain Tribes from 1852 to 1892, because some leaders of the tribes opposed the British Government.

In 1851 two officers of the British Customs department in a place called Tanawal were killed. The British believed they were killed by the Hasanzai part of the Yusufzai tribe, so the British then sent an army led by Colonel Mackeson, which destroyed a number of tribal strongholds. In 1868 the Yusufzai helped by the Khan of Agror, who was upset that the British had set up a police post at Oghi in the Agror valley, attacked that post with many men. But he was forced to move back. 

The Khan of Tandwal, who remained loyal to British, faced attacks by tribes who didn't like the British. Then a large number of the tribes began marching against the British, the British managed to stop them and force them back - however during the fighting twenty-one British villages had been burnt. The British then organised an army under General Wilde - he and his men managed to take over all of the Black Mountain and forced the tribes to accept British rule.

In 1888 the British blocked the area due to the raids by the Hasanzai and Akazai tribes who were being helped by the Madda Khel tribe into the Agror valley. While the British were planning tougher attacks - Major Battye and Captain Urmston and some soldiers of the 5th Gurkhas were surprised and killed by the Gujar tribe (who were allies of the Akazai tribe).

Hashim Ali, who was the chief of the Hasanzai and Akazai, was blamed for starting the attack. The British then sent an armies against the tribes in the same year (1881), the tribes had to pay a lot money to the British and also had to agree that Hashim Ali was not allowed to live there any more. The British then made Ibrahim Khan, a relative and enemy of Hashim Ali, ruler.

In 1890 the tribe stopped the march of British troops along the crest of the Black Mountain, and so an army was sent against them in the spring of 1891. As soon as the troops left, the Hindustanis and Madda Khel broke their agreement with the British Government by letting Hashim Ali return. In 1892 the British sent their armies again to fight the tribes - this ended with the tribes being defeated by British.

Kala Dhaka was badly affected by the 2005 Pakistan earthquake, according to a report in Time magazine:

Geography of Romania

With an area of , Romania is the biggest country in southeastern Europe. It is the twelfth-largest in Europe. A large part of Romania's border with Serbia and Bulgaria is made by the Danube. The Danube is joined by the Prut River. The Prut River makes the border with the Republic of Moldova. The Danube then flows into the area of the Black Sea inside of Romania, which forms the Danube Delta. The Danube Delta is the second biggest one of the best kept deltas in Europe. It is also a biosphere reserve and a biodiversity World Heritage Site. Some of the other major rivers in Romania are the Siret, which runs from the north to the south of Moldavia; the Olt, which runs from the Carpathian Mountains to Oltenia; and the Mureş, which runs through Transylvania from the east to the west.

The land in Romania is equally divided among mountainous, hilly and lowland areas. The Carpathian Mountains make up a big part of the center of Romania. 14 of its mountain ranges are taller than 2,000 meters. The tallest mountain in Romania is Moldoveanu Peak ().

The Danube is the longest river in Romania. It travels about 1,075 kilometers, almost 40% of its length, through Romania. Almost all of Romania's rivers are either direct or tributaries of the Danube. The most important of these rivers are the Mureş River, the Olt River, the Prut, the Siret River, the Ialomiţa River, the Someş River, and the Argeş River.

The rivers of Romania flow either north, south, east, or west away from the Carpathians. Rain and other precipitation help add to the flow of water in each of the rivers and occasionally cause flooding. In the east, the water from the rivers are obtained by the Siret and Prut rivers. In the south, the rivers flow directly into the Danube. In the west, the rivers flow into the Tisza, which is in Hungary.

The Danube is the most important river in Romania. People use it for transportation and to make hydroelectric power from the rivers' flow of water. Boats and other watercraft are able to travel on nearly all of the places that the Danube flows in Romania. A problem that has occurred with using it for transportation is the fact that it is not very close by any of Romania's big industries.

Romania is in the southeastern part of Europe, where it borders the Black Sea and the Danube. The Carpathian mountains lie in the center.

Geographic coordinates:
Extreme points of Romania:


Because of how far it is from the open sea and where it is in the southwestern part of the European continent, Romania has a climate that is changes between temperate and continental climates with four different seasons. The average yearly temperature is 11 °C in the south and 8 °C in the north. The extreme recorded temperatures are 44.5 °C in Ion Sion 1951 and -38.5 °C in Bod 1942. 

Rain, snow, and other precipitation is decent with over per year on the highest western mountains. Most of this falls as snow, which gives Romania good skiing. In the south-centern parts of the country, the amount of rain and snow falls to around . In the Danube Delta, not much rain falls. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Romania was -38.5 °C, near Braşov in the year 1944. The highest temperature ever recorded in Romania was 45 °C, near Calafat in the 1950s.

Mohenjo-daro

Mohenjo-daro was one of the largest city-settlements of the Indus Valley Civilization of south Asia. 

It was located in what is now the province of Sindh, Pakistan. The city was built around 2600 BC. It was one of the early urban settlements in the world. Mohenjo-daro existed at the same time as the civilisations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia and Greece. The archaeological ruins of the city are designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

The "Dancing girl" found in Mohenjo-daro is an artifact that is some 4500 years old. The 10.8 cm long bronze statue of the dancing girl was found in 1926 from a house in Mohenjo-daro. She was British archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler's favorite statuette, as he said in this quote from a 1973 television program:

John Marshall, one of the excavators at Mohenjo-daro, described her as a vivid impression of the young ... "girl, her hand on her hip in a half-impudent posture, and legs slightly forward as she beats time to the music with her legs and feet."

A seated male sculpture is the so-called "Priest King" (even though there is no evidence that either priests or kings ruled the city). Archaeologists discovered the sculpture in Lower town at Mohenjo-daro in 1927. It was found in an unusual house with ornamental brickwork and a wall niche and was lying between brick foundation walls which once held up a floor.

This bearded sculpture wears a fillet around the head, an armband, and a cloak decorated with trefoil patterns that were originally filled with red pigment.

Gilgit Agency

Gilgit Agency () was the name of most of the area of northern Kashmir which formed a de facto dependency of Pakistan from 1947 to 1970, which was then merged into Northern Areas. The Agency was administered directly from Islamabad separately from the neighbouring state of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and the princely states of Hunza-Nagar District. The area of the Agency comprised the traditional region of Gilgit. The Agency also bordered the Sinkiang region of China to the northeast, the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir to the south, Baltistan to east, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west. Both India and Pakistan recognise the regions of Gilgit and Baltistan as disputed and technically part of the divided State of Jammu & Kashmir.

The chief towns of the Agency were Gilgit and Skardu with the small town of Ghyari also holding significance for Shia Muslims as the site of a mosque built by Sayyid Ali Hamadani, a fourteenth century Persian who brought Islam to the region

The Guanaco ("Lama guanicoe") is camelid animal native to South America. Guanacos are usually found in small herds or loosely structured family groups.

When a member of the herd picks up the slightest hint of danger, it makes a high-pitched warning call, causing the other guanacos to flee swiftly and nimbly across the steep and uneven terrain.

Guanacos generally live at high elevations, grazing on grasses and browsing on leaves and buds.
They can get by without water for long periods of time, obtaining moisture from the plants they eat.

On the chest, at the base of the neck, is a peculiar, pompon-like 'mane' of silky white hairs which may be 20-30 cm / 8-12 inches in length. The vicuña is extremely slender, with long skinny limbs and neck. The head is small and wedge shaped, with small, triangular ears. Unique among living even toed-ungulates, the incisors of the vicuña are constantly growing, with enamel on only one side, to keep up with the wear caused by the tough grasses on which they feed.

Nocturnes (Debussy)

Nocturnes is a piece of music for orchestra by the French composer Claude Debussy. There are three movements. A female chorus also sings in the last movement. Debussy finished writing "Nocturnes" on 15 December 1899. 

The three movements each have a title. They are:

A large portion of Debussy’s music, including his nocturnes, is inspired by the works of the Impressionist painters. The word nocturne (from the Latin "nocturnus") usually describes a piece that is inspired by the night. However, Debussy's Nocturnes do not follow this patter; rather, they capture the way light is shown in Impressionist paintings.

'Nuages' is about the clouds in the sky and the way they move slowly in grey colours with a little white.

'Fêtes' is a very lively picture of a group of people having a celebration and dancing. A procession is heard arriving. The music of the procession gradually gets louder, mixes with the music of the dancing, then it gradually dies away as the procession disappears into the distance.

'Sirènes' describes the sea and the many rhythms that can be heard when we listen to it. The moonlight shines on the sea, and the mysterious song of the Sirens is heard as they laugh.

The Lamoureux Orchestra conducted by Camille Chevillard gave the first performance of "Nuages" and "Fêtes" in Paris in 1900, and they played the first performance of all three movements the next year. Some of the listeners found it hard to understand at first, but today "Nocturnes" is one of Debussy’s most popular works.

The music lasts for about 22 minutes.

Freedom of the press is a promise by a government not to punish journalists and other people who report the news for doing their job. It is an idea that is like freedom of speech, because it protects people from expressing their opinions or beliefs. Many countries have passed laws or constitutional amendments protecting freedom of the press. 

Like with freedom of speech, freedom of the press does not protect everything that a journalist writes. A journalist can be sued for libel, which is publishing news about a person that they know is false. Publishing copyrighted material is not legal in many countries. Writing about state secrets, like military plans, weapon designs, or other classified information is almost always illegal.

Pictures at an Exhibition

Pictures at an Exhibition is a famous piece of music for solo piano composed by Modest Mussorgsky in 1874. It is Mussorgsky’s best solo piano work. Many years after Mussorgsky’s death a French composer called Maurice Ravel made an arrangement of the piece for orchestra. This arrangement has become very famous and this is the form in which people usually hear the music today.

"Pictures at an Exhibition" is a musical description of an exhibition of pictures by the painter Viktor Hartmann. Hartmann was only 39 when he died in 1873. He and Mussorgsky had been good friends. They both tried to give their works a very Russian character: Hartmann through his pictures and Mussorgsky through his music. In 1874 an exhibition of Hartmann’s pictures was organised in the Academy of Fine Arts in St Petersburg. Mussorgsky went to the exhibition and was inspired to compose his piano piece. 

"Pictures at an Exhibition" describes someone walking round the exhibition and looking at the pictures. The ten pictures he describes in music were drawings and watercolours. Mussorgsky starts his piece with a tune which describes the person walking round the exhibition. It is usually known as the “promenade” theme (a promenade is a walk). At first Mussorgsky puts the promenade theme between each picture, but he does not do that all the way through the piece. Some of the later pictures have bits of the promenade theme in the music.

Mussorgsky composed the piece very quickly, although he was drunk a lot of the time. It was not published until 1886, five years after the composer’s death. The composer’s great friend Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov published it, but he made some changes to what Mussorgsky had written. It was not until 1931 that an edition was published which tried to show exactly what Mussorgsky had written.

Four of the pictures that Mussorgsky described in his music:

<doc id="120992" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=120992" title="Wicca rock">
Wicca rock

Wicca music or Wicca rock is music influenced by the Wicca religion and its beliefs relating to nature and conservation written by Wiccan musicians living in some of the most naturally beautiful forest regions of the world, in Canada. It is said by some to be an emerging sub-genre of alternative music

The early signs of this category's formation got people talking. A music band called ThemistouredCanada and the USA singing and talking about Wicca. The Themis body of works promotes things that are Wiccan such as the divinity of nature; the Lord and Lady (dual deity aspect of Wicca) and an ethical credo that resembles Wiccan philosophies.

Another Canadian band, a group of vocalists from Vancouver Canada, the Chalice and Blade, also perform original pieces based on the beliefs of Wicca and "sing songs which show (their) reverence for the earth and the balance of the God and Goddess" -Chalice and Blade

The "Ethics of Wicca music" also mirrors the global ethic standardadopted by the United Nations and by the 1993 Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago..

Comparing Wicca Music ethicswith the Global Ethic StandardWicca Music's ecological and ethical aspects suggests that Wicca Music (and Wicca in part) satisfies the Council for a Parliament of World Religions'Declaration for a Global Ethic's request for universal adoption.

"All historical experience demonstrates the following: Our earth cannot be changed unless in the not too distant future an alteration in the consciousness of individuals is achieved. This has already been seen in areas such as war and peace or economy and ecology. And it is precisely for this alteration in inner orientation, in the entire mentality, in the "heart," that the religions bear responsibility in a special way. Here we remain aware, however, that a universal consensus on many disputed individual ethical questions (from bio- and sexual ethics through mass media and scientific ethics to economic and political ethics) will be difficult to attain. Nevertheless, even for many questions still disputed, differentiated solutions should be attainable in the spirit of the fundamental principles jointly developed here.

In many areas of life a new consciousness of ethical responsibility has already arisen. Therefore, we would be especially pleased if as many as possible national or international professional organizations, such as those for physicians, scientists, business people, journalists, and politicians, would compose up to date codes of ethics."(Download Full PDF Document from parliamentofreligions.com)

Evidenced in lyrics of "Wicca" songs like "I am The Shadow" by Themis, "Love of Life" by Themis , and "Ancient Trees" by Chalice and Blade Wiccan musicians support a culture promoting ecology; of non-violence and respect for life; the divinity of mother nature; solidarity with 'earth'; a just economic order; tolerance, healing and truthfulness and equal rights and partnership between men and women (although Wiccan women have a higher rank).

According to The Religion Newswriters Foundation "Wicca is moving into the mainstream" smashing stereotypes as their movement matures. Throughout America, Wiccans are organizing congregations and youth groups, training clergy, pursuing charity work, sharing parenting tips and fighting for civil rights, . 

Wicca is a diverse earth-based religious tradition that honors nature and the cycles of the seasons. Wiccans celebrate solar holidays such as the solstices, equinoxes and the four midpoints in between, as well as lunar cycles. This religion is one of the fastest-growing in the United States, and it is notable for the leadership of women, concern for the environment, and in some cases for political activism, particularly efforts to counter misunderstanding and stereotyping. -- The Harvard University Pluralism Project

Wicca has enchanted pop culture and many teenagers. The number of Wiccans in the U.S. and Canada is doubling about every 30 months. But neverthelss the percentage of Wiccans in the entire U.S. and Canada populations is still less than 1%. 

"Wicca Rock" may not be religious neutral to many of the Christian faith. Some conservative Christians feel that even gospel music or Contemporary Christian Music is unholy. 

Perhaps less about political correctness and more about ecology beliefs which are common to all religions, Wicca music, according to both 'Themis'and 'The Chalice and Blade', advances that the cycles of nature are the "holy days"; the earth is the true "temple"; and the "plants" and "creatures" their musical partners and inspirations. "We respect life, cherish the free will of sentient beings, and accept the sacredness of all creation. Our bible is the wind and the rain." -Ruffian Angel, song writer and lead singer of Themis

We thrive in the song and spirit of the birds and other creatures of the wild -- our music is written from a love of all life. -A Wiccan Music Creed

Unlike much Gothic Rock,and even alternative rock, Wicca music is bright and cheerful, promoting positive Wicca ideals. "The Craft is a joyous creed; it is also a socially and ecologically responsible one... Love of life in all its forms, is the basic ethic of the Craft." -The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill - Wicca 101 

Converse to Gothic rock which comes from the dark, Wicca music comes from the light side.

In 2007, Themis, with a strong pro-ecology message morphed from a Punk rock background into the Wicca music realm. The band's followers advance the idea that modern Wicca should be more about nature, ecology and feminism and less about witchcraft and spirtualism. ("...the new music direction is about loving life, nature and Earth as a living thing") "We thrive in the song and spirit of the birds and other creatures of the wild -- our music is written from a love of all life. The cycles of nature are our holy days: the earth is our temple, its plants and creatures our partners and teachers so we respect life, cherish the free will of sentient beings, and accept the sacredness of all creation."Our bible is the wind and the rain."

Art rock

Art rock (also described as progressive rock or classical rock) is a word that is about a sub-genre of rock music that has "experimental influences".. The term 'Art Rock' or 'Kunst Rock' was coined and defined, by the great black philosopher Doctor William Fearon, and is very much related to the 'Kunst Muzik' of the 1970s led by UK/US bands such as the Ramones, Talking Heads and Television and the Detroit/German led Techno movement. Dr Fearon coined the term and its German equivalent in recognition of the impact that Futurism had on late twentieth century music. Far from being an album based music format Art Rock is recognisable at live venues in the modern age, with the developments in light and video technology meaning that Art and Rock can be seamelessly fused. It is an album-based form that is able to have longer, more complex music and lets the musicians spend more time trying different ways to play their instruments. Art rock is not created for mass consumption, meaning it is not made to be liked by most people. It is often long and has a lot of themes like classical music, but usually has more keyboards than guitars. Also, it is not really music to dance to, but music to just listen to, and it often tells a story or has a philosophical theme to the lyrics."

The idea of "art rock" has sometimes been used when talking about the "progressive rock" bands which became popular in the 1970s. Allmusic says that progressive rock and art rock are almost the same; both used to describe rock music that is more artistic. Progressive rock eventually stuck as a label for a specific genre of rock music, while art rock was used to described bands that were harder to label. 

Princeton University's Wordnet dictionary states that "progressive rock, art rock" are "a style of rock music that [came out] in the 1970s; associated with attempts to [mix] rock with jazz and other forms." It also says that it is meant "for listening and not dancing". 

Examples include Queen, The Who, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, David Bowie, The Velvet Underground, The Beatles, Genesis and Yes.

Blender (magazine)

Blender is an American music magazine that self-identifies as "the ultimate guide to music and more." It is also known for sometimes having pictures of female celebrities that shows them with a lot of their body uncovered. It puts together lists of albums, artists, and songs, including both "best of" lists and "worst of" lists. In each issue, there is a review of an artist's entire discography, with a review of each album. The magazine teamed up with VH1 to create the "50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs".

"Blender" is published by Dennis Publishing. The magazine was started in 1994 as the first digital CD-ROM magazine by Jason Pearson, David Cherry & Regina Joseph, acquired by Felix Dennis/Dennis Publishing, UK. It published 15 digital CD issues, and launched on the web in 1997. It started publishing a print edition again in 1999 in the same form that it does today. Blender CD-ROM showcased the earliest digital editorial (paper) formats, as well as the first forms of digital advertising. The first digital advertisers included: Calvin Klein, Apple Computer, Toyota and Nike.

<doc id="121017" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121017" title="Discography">
Discography

Discography is the study and listing of sound recordings. The word comes from the word "disc", which is the most commonly used term for describing the format used most for sound recordings in the 20th century, and the "-graph" suffix meaning something written.

A listing of all recordings of a musician or singer is usually called their "discography". Discographies may also be created based on a particular musical genre or record label, for example, so that all artists in a genre, or that have contracts with a certain label, are listed together.

The term "discography" became popular in the 1930s by collectors of jazz records. Jazz fans did research and self-published discographies about when jazz records were made and what musicians were on the records, as record companies did not commonly include that information on/with the records at that time.

Euplocephalus (meaning "well-armored head") was a large armored dinosaur, measuring about 20 feet (6 m) long; it weighed about 2 tons. Its wide head had a horny, toothless beak, small, peg-like cheek teeth, bony horns, and a small brain. Among its contemporaries were the large meat-eating "Tyrannosaurus" and "Deinonychus".

Fossils from more than 40 individuals have been discovered in Alberta, Canada and Montana in the United States, making "Euoplocephalus" the best known ankylosaurid. This includes 15 skulls, teeth, and a few almost-complete skeletons, found with the armor still attached. Individual armor plates are the most commonly found element from them.

Progressive metal

Progressive metal (often called prog metal) is a sub-genre of heavy metal music that mixes the powerful, guitar-driven sound of metal with the complexity of progressive rock, which includes odd time signatures and complicated instrumental playing. Some progressive metal bands are also influenced by jazz fusion and classical music. Like progressive rock songs, progressive metal songs are usually much longer than other metal songs, and they are often themed in concept albums. As a result, progressive metal is rarely heard on mainstream radio and video programs.

The origins of progressive metal started with progressive rock bands from the late 1960s and early to mid-1970s such as Yes, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, King Crimson, Genesis, Kansas and Rush. However, progressive metal did not evolve into a genre of its own until the mid-1980s. Bands such as Queensrÿche and Dream Theater took certain things about progressive rock groups and mixed them with heavy metal styles.

Mamenchisaurus was a long-necked, long-tailed, four-legged, plant-eating dinosaur. 

"Mamenchisaurus" had the longest neck of any known dinosaur, except the newly found "Sauroposeidon". Mamenchisaurus' neck was about 46 feet (14 m). It had 19 vertebrae in its neck, more than any other known dinosaur had. "Mamenchisaurus" was about 70 to 80 feet (21 to 25 m) long and weighed roughly 12 tons (11 tonnes). 

Its hind legs were longer than the front legs; these hind legs were similar to the legs of "Diplodocus". Its skull however, was box-shaped (unlike Diplodocus' elongated snout).

<doc id="121031" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121031" title="Knoxville, Tennessee">
Knoxville, Tennessee

Knoxville is the third-largest city in the state of Tennessee, in the United States of America. The largest city in the state is Memphis, followed by Nashville, the capital of Tennessee. Knoxville is the county seat of Knox County. In 2010, it had a population of 178,874.

Knoxville was founded in 1786 and is the second oldest of Tennessee's four major cities, after Nashville which was founded in 1779. After Tennessee's admission into the Union in 1796, Knoxville was the state's first capital. In 1819, the capital was moved to Murfreesboro, prior to Nashville becoming the current capital. The city was named in honor of the first Secretary of War, Henry Knox.

Knoxville's economy is largely fueled by the regional location of the main campus of the University of Tennessee, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and other Department of Energy facilities in nearby Oak Ridge, the National Transportation Research Center, and the Tennessee Valley Authority.

Knoxville's textile and manufacturing industries were hurt by foreign competition in the 1950s and 1960s. After the building of the Interstate Highway system in the 1960s, the railroad—which had been largely responsible for Knoxville's industrial growth—began to decline. Suburban shopping malls in the 1970s took retail revenues away from Knoxville's Downtown area. So, the city sought to recover the massive loss of revenue by trying to annex neighboring communities in Knox County. People fought these annexation attempts. Several efforts to combine all of the Knoxville and Knox County governments failed. But the city and county school boards merged on 1 July 1987.

Knoxville tried to improve its downtown. The 1982 World's Fair—the most successful of these projects—became one of the most popular world's fairs in U.S. history with 11 million visitors. The fair's energy theme was selected due to Knoxville being the headquarters of the Tennessee Valley Authority and for the city's proximity to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The Sunsphere, a steel truss structure topped with a gold-colored glass sphere, was built for the fair and remains one of Knoxville's most prominent buildings, along with the adjacent amphitheater which underwent a renovation that was completed in 2008.

Ever since, Knoxville's downtown has been developing, with the opening of the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame and the Knoxville Convention Center, redevelopment of Market Square, a new visitors center, a regional history museum, a Regal Cinemas theater, several restaurants and bars, and many new and redeveloped condominiums. Since 2000 Knoxville has successfully brought business back to the downtown area. The arts in particular have begun to flourish, there are multiple venues for outdoor concerts. The Tennessee and Bijou Theaters were renovated.
Knoxville has seven sister cities as designated by Sister Cities International:

<doc id="121032" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121032" title="Così fan tutte">
Così fan tutte

Così fan tutte is an opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It is always known by its Italian title. This is probably because it is impossible to find a good translation for the title, which means something like: “They all do it like that”, or “They are all like that” (meaning: “Women are all like that”). Its full title is Così fan tutte ossia La scuola degli amanti (That is how they all do it, or The School For Lovers). It is an opera buffa (a comic opera). The libretto was written by Lorenzo da Ponte. Cosi fan tutte is seen in the well-loved manga, Nodame Cantabile (のだめカンタービレ) where Saiko Tagaya sings a part from the opera, showing agony that Shinichi Chiaki doesn't like her anymore.

The opera is often called "Così" for short in the English-speaking world. It is one of the three Mozart operas for which da Ponte wrote the libretto (the words). The other two operas on which they worked together were "The Marriage of Figaro" and "Don Giovanni". 

Emperor Joseph II suggested to Mozart that he should write the opera. The libretto was originally going to be set to music by another composer, Antonio Salieri but Salieri only finished parts of the first act and then stopped working at the opera.

The first performance was at the Burgtheater in Vienna on January 26 1790.

Unlike "The Marriage of Figaro", the story of this opera did not offend people at the time. However, during the next two centuries many people thought the story was rather naughty, so it was not often performed. When it was, it was often changed.

Today it is one of the most often performed operas in the opera houses throughout the world. Although the story is quite silly, it has some of Mozart’s most beautiful music.

The story is about two young ladies who each have a lover. Don Alfonso, a cynical bachelor, makes a bet with the two men that their girl friends would easily fall in love with someone else. The two lovers disguise themselves, and make love to the other one’s girl friend. At first the women are not willing, but later they are.

The story takes place in Naples in the 18th century.

Ferrando and Guglielmo are two young officers. Ferrando is in engaged to Dorabella and Guglielmo to her sister Fiordiligi. When they are talking in a coffee shop, they say that their fiancées will always be faithful to them. Don Alfonso joins the talking and makes a bet with the two officers. He says that he can prove that all women (even Dorabella and Fiordiligi) are fickle (meaning that they easily change lovers instead of being faithful to just one). The men take on the bet. They pretend they have to go to fight in a war and say a sad goodbye. Their boat sails off to sea, while Alfonso and the sisters wish them a safe journey.

Despina, the sisters’ maid, arrives and asks what is wrong. Dorabella is desperately sad. Despina does not take it seriously, and says they should get new lovers. Alfonso is worried that Despina will recognize the men through their disguises, so he bribes her into helping him win the bet. The two men then arrive, dressed as Albanians. They have moustaches. The sisters enter and are worried when they see two strange men in their home. The Albanians try to make friends with them, but the girls do not want them.

The Albanians enter in an uproar, pretend to drink arsenic, and fall to the ground. It seems that a doctor arrives, but it is Despina in disguise who draws out the poison with a magnet. The two men recover and ask for a kiss. They are encouraged to humor the men by Despina and Alfonso, but the sisters refuse.

In the sisters’ bedroom Despina is trying to persuade the sisters to love the Albanians. After she leaves, Dorabella says to Fiordiligi that she does actually fancy the Albanian, and the two girls agree that a little flirtation will do no harm and will help them pass the time while they wait for their lovers to return.

In the garden, Dorabella and the disguised Guglielmo go off together, as do the other two. They have an awkward conversation and Ferrando departs with Fiordiligi. Now alone, Guglielmo tries to woo Dorabella. She pretends at first that she does not want him, but soon gives in. She gives him a medallion (with Ferrando's portrait inside) in exchange for a heart-shaped locket.

Ferrando is less successful with Fiordiligi, so he is angry when he later finds out from Guglielmo that the medallion with his portrait has been so quickly given away to a new lover. Guglielmo at first sympathises with Ferrando but then says he is very happy, because his girl is faithful.

In the sister's room, Dorabella tells Fiordiligi about the wrong thing she did. Fiordiligi, who is now upset, decides to go to the army and find her lover. Before she can leave, though, Ferrando arrives and again woos her. Fiordiligi finally gives in and falls into his arms. Guglielmo is very unhappy while Ferrando reminds Guglielmo about how he had been boasting a short while ago about his girl’s faithfulness. Alfonso seems to have won the bet. He tells the men to forgive their fiancées. After all: "Così fan tutte" ("All women are like that.") 

The last scene begins as a wedding for both couples: the sisters and their “Albanian” lovers. Despina is now disguised as a notary. She gets everyone to sign the marriage contract. Military music is heard in the distance. This means that the officers are returning. Alfonso tells the sisters that Ferrando and Guglielmo are on their way to the house. The Albanians hurry off to hide (actually, to change out of their disguises). They return as themselves (the officers), saying how much they love the girls. Alfonso drops the marriage contract in front of the officers, and, when they read it, they become very angry. They then go off and return moments later, half in Albanian disguise, half as officers. Everyone realizes that Despina had been the notary, and the sisters now know they have been deceived. All is forgiven, and everyone sings about accepting life in good times and in bad.

This is more true for magazines dealing with business and professional topics. When determining readership figures, which is how many people read an issue, the number is usually considered to be higher than the circulation figures because of the assumption that most copies of the magazine are read by more than one person. In many countries, circulation figures are checked by companies that do not work for the magazine, such as the Audit Bureau of Circulations, to make sure that the numbers a publisher gives to advertisers is accurate.

The Palos Verdes Blue butterfly is a small endangered butterfly that can be seen near the Palos Verdes Peninsula in southwest Los Angeles County, California. So far, it can only be seen here and might be one of the rarest butterflies in the world.

This butterfly has a wingspan of only 25–30 mm. The male has a bright silvery-blue dorsal wing outlined in a narrow line of black, while the female’s dorsal wing is a more brownish-gray color. Both males and females have gray ventral wings with dark spots surrounded by white rings.

"G. lygdamus palosverdesensis" was listed as an endangered species by the Fish and Wildlife Service on July 2, 1980. Insects are not currently protected by California law.

The main threat to the Palos Verdes Blue has been the destruction of their living space by weeds, which has negative effects on the larval foodplants needed.

Wingspan refers to the span of an airplane or a bird and is the distance from the left wingtip to the right wingtip. 

The wingspan of an aircraft is always measured in a straight line, from wingtip to wingtip, independently of wing shape or sweep.

To measure the wingspan of a bird, a live or freshly dead specimen is placed flat on its back, the wings are grasped at the wrist joints and ankles, and then the distance is measured between the tips of the longest primary feathers on each wing.

The University of Cambridge (also called Cambridge University) is located in Cambridge, England. It is the second-oldest university of all English-speaking countries. It is one of the world's leading places of learning.
The University grew out of a group of scholars in the city of Cambridge. Early records suggest that this happened in 1209 by scholars leaving Oxford after a dispute with local people there. The universities of Oxford and Cambridge are often called "Oxbridge". This is not a different university. It is a way of saying Oxford and Cambridge together.

Cambridge University and Oxford University both had a big effect on the history of England. They also have a long history of rivalry with each other.

Cambridge is usually ranked in the world's top 5 universities.

Many members of the British Royal Family chose to attend the University of Cambridge - King Edward VII, King George VI, Prince Henry of Gloucester, Prince William of Gloucester and Edinburgh and Prince Charles were all students there. There have also been 82 people who were students at Cambridge and later won a Nobel Prize.

The University of Cambridge is a member of

It is also considered part of the "Golden Triangle", a geographical concentration of UK university research.

The Cambridge University Library is the main library of the university and consists of five separate libraries: the University Library main building, the Medical Library, the Betty and Gordon Moore Library (mathematics), the Central Science Library, and the Squire Law Library. 

In addition to the 8 million volumes of the University Library there are about 4 million books in college and other libraries.

The library is the oldest major library in the UK, having been founded before 1416. The present main library was built to the west of the city in the 1930s by the architect Giles Gilbert Scott. From the 16th century onwards it received generous donations or bequests of books and growth was considerably increased once the privilege of legal deposit had been granted (it is still one of only three copyright deposit libraries in England under British law).

The current librarian is Anne Jarvis, the first woman to hold the post.
The Chancellorship is a ceremonial post created in 1246. The duties include giving speeches in Latin and promoting the university. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh has served as the 107th chancellor from 1975 to 2011. Four candidates are running to replace him. Voters must appear in person wearing academic gowns. The university will provide tea and sandwiches for voters. Before 2011, the last time there was a contested election for the post was 1847.

Passer rating

Passer rating (known as passing efficiency or pass efficiency in NCAA football) is a measure of how well a quarterback, or any other passer in American and Canadian football, played. Math is used to get the passer rating. To get a good passer rating, a quarterback needs to have a high number of good passes and touchdowns. A quarterback can get a bad passer rating if the quarterback has many interceptions.

Chenab River

The Chenab River (Punjabi: ਚਨਾਬ, IAST: canāb, Urdu: چناب, literally: 'Moon(Chan) چن River(aab)') آب is formed by the confluence of the Chandra and Bhaga rivers at Tandi located in the upper Himalayas in the Lahul and Spiti District of Himachal Pradesh, Republic of India. In its upper reaches it is also known as the Chandrabhaga. It is a tributary of the Indus River.

It flows through the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir into the plains of the Punjab, forming the boundary between the Rechna and Jech interfluves (Doabs in Persian). It is joined by the Jhelum River at Trimmu تریمو and then by the Ravi River Ahmadpur Siyaal احمدپورسیال. It then merges with the Sutlej River near Uch Sharif to form the Panjnad or the 'Five Rivers', the fifth being the Beas River which joins the Satluj near Ferozepur, India. The Chenab then joins the Indus at Mithankot. The total length of the Chenab is approximately 960 kilometres. 

The waters of the Chenab are allocated to Pakistan under the terms of the Indus Waters Treaty.

The Baglihar hydropower dam is being built (as of 2006) on the Chenab River in the Doda district. This is about 110 kilometers eastward of the Pakistan border in the Jammu division of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The dam is one of 9 hydro-electric projects on the Chenab River.

The river Jhelum rises from a spring at Verinag situated at the foot of the Pir Panjal in the south-eastern part of the valley of Kashmir. It flows through Srinagar and the Wular Lake before entering Pakistan from Kashmir through a deep narrow gorge. The Kishenganga Neelum River, the largest tributary of the Jhelum, joins it near Muzaffarabad, as does the next largest, the Kunhar River of the Kaghan valley. It also connects with Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on Kohala Bridge east of Circle Bakote. It is then joined by the Poonch river, and flows into the Mangla reservoir in the Mirpur District. The Jhelum enters the Punjab in the Jhelum District. From there, it flows through the plains of Pakistan's Punjab, forming the boundary between the Chaj and Sindh Sagar Doabs. It ends in a confluence with the Chenab at Trimmu in District Jhang. The Chenab merges with the Sutlej to form the Panjnad River which joins the Indus River at Mithankot.

The Ravi River (Sanskrit: रवि, Punjabi: ਰਾਵੀ, Urdu: راوی) is a river in Kashmir and Pakistan. It is one of the five rivers which give Punjab its name. 

The Ravi was known as Parushani or Iravati to Indians in Vedic times and Hydraotes to the Ancient Greeks. 

It originates in the Himalayas in the Chamba district of Himachal Pradesh following a north-westerly course. It turns to the south-west, near Dalhousie, and then cuts a gorge in the Dhaola Dhar range entering the Punjab plain near Madhopur. It then flows along the Indo-Pak border for some distance before entering Pakistan and joining the Chenab River. 

The total length of the river is about 720 km. 

The waters of the Ravi river are allocated to India under the Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan and the resulting Indus Basin Project. 

It is also called 'The river of Lahore' since that great city is located on its eastern bank. On its western bank is located the famous town of Shahdara with the tomb of Jahangir and the Tomb of Noor Jahan.

Polly Pocket

Polly Pocket is a line of small plastic dolls and accessories for girls. The name comes from the fact that many of the first Polly Pocket toys came in pocket-size cases. The Fashion Polly dolls are sold by Mattel.

Polly was first designed by Chris Wiggs in 1983 for his daughter Kate. Using a powder compact, he created a small house for the very small doll. Bluebird Toys of Swindon, England licensed the idea. The first Polly Pocket were sold in stores in 1989. Mattel held a distribution agreement with Bluebird Toys for Polly Pocket items in the early 1990s. In 1998, while production slowed, several companies tried to buy Bluebird Toys. Mattel finally bought the company later that year. 

In 1999, Mattel changed the design of Polly. They created a new series of collectible items. The new Polly doll is larger. It also looks more similar to a real person than the first dolls. That same year, Mattel also started selling Fashion Polly!. This line used the same characters from the new Polly Pocket (Polly, Lea, Shani, Lila, etc.) but they were 3 ¾ inch (9.5 cm) plastic jointed dolls. Instead of the normal cloth clothing, Polly Pockets used "Polly Stretch" clothing. These were rubbery plastic clothes that could be put on the dolls and removed. They also created boy dolls.

Shyok River

The Shyok River is a river flowing through Ladakh and the disputed Northern Areas of Pakistan (Ghanche District). Shyok river (a tributary of the Indus) originates from the Rimo glacier, one of the tongues of Siachen Glacier and becomes very wide at the confluence with the Nubra River (a tributary of Shyok, originating from Siachen Glacier). 

The alignment of the Shyok river is very unusual, originating from the Rimo glacier it flows in a SE direction and at joining the Pangong range it takes a NW turn and flows parallel to its previous path. The Shyok flowing in a wide valley suddenly enters a narrow gorge after Chalunka and then joins the Indus at Skardu (Pakistan). The Nubra river originating from the Siachen glacier also behaves like the Shyok, before Tirit the SE flowing river takes a NW turn on meeting the river Shyok. The similarity in the courses of these two important rivers probably indicates a series of palaeo fault lines trending NW-SE in delimiting the upper courses of the rivers. The importance of the Indus River and the Shyok rivers is in the deposition of a huge thickness of Quaternary sediments a treasure trove for geology researchers.

Near Pharwala Fort it cuts through a high mountain range and that is a wonderful phenomenon of nature. The place is called Swan Cut. No stream can cut such a high mountain. It proves the Swaan was there before the formation of this range. And when the mountain rose through millions of years, the stream continued its path by cutting the rising mountain. Ling stream, following a relatively long course though Lehtrar and Kahuta falls in the Swaan near Sihala.

Islamabad Highway crosses this stream near Sihala where famous bridge Cock Pull is constructed over it. Another famous, Lai stream joins this stream near Swaan Camp. After walking a tortuous path and creating a big curve, the stream reaches Kalabagh where it falls into the Indus river. This relatively small stream is more than 250 kilometers long. Due to its mountainous course and shallow bed, it is hardly used for irrigation purposes. For grinding wheat, you can find ancient types of flour mills near Chakian. Fishing is not possible in this stream as a profession. Rohu is the main species of fish in this stream. Kingfisher birds hunt here too.

Wisent

Wisent name for the European bison ("Bison bonasus") is a bison species and the heaviest surviving animal in Europe. It is a close relative of the American Bison.
Longer legged and less heavily built than its American cousin, the wisent may reach a height of 54 to 60 in. (137–152 cm) at the shoulder, and a weight of more than 1 ton (900 kg). It has brown hair and short upcurved horns. Its hump is less prominent than that of the American bison and its coat less shaggy.
In the wild the wisent is a forest animal; it browses on leaves, ferns, and bark. Females give birth after a gestation period of 9 to 10 months, usually to a single calf. Abundant in Europe in prehistoric times, wisents remained numerous until the early Christian era.
Hunted for their meat and displaced from their habitats by farmers, by the 11th cent. they had been reduced to herds numbering but a few hundred animals. By 1927 fewer than 50 remained. Since the foundation of an international protective society in 1932, their numbers have been growing, but they are no longer found outside zoos or forest reserves.

Panjnad River (, Sanskrit: panj = five, nadi = river) is a river in Punjab, Pakistan. Panjnad River is formed by successive confluence of the five rivers of Punjab, namely Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej. Jhelum and Ravi join Chenab, Beas joins Sutlej, and then Sutlej and Chenab join to form Panjnad near Uch Sharif. The combined stream runs southwest for approximately 45 miles and joins Indus River at Mithankot. The Indus continues into the Arabian Sea. A dam on Panjnad has been erected; it provides irrigation channels for Punjab and Sind provinces south of the Sutlej and east of the Indus rivers.

Beyond the meeting of Indus and Panjnad rivers, the Indus river was known as Satnad (Sat = seven) carrying the waters of seven rivers including Indus river, which is believed to be in ealrlier times the Saraswati River/Ghaggar-Hakra River river which eventually dried and became a seasonal river due to seismic shifts in the glacial region of Himachal Pradesh where it originated and later on Kabul river and the five rivers of Punjab.

Kabul River

Kabul River, or Kabal River (), is a river that rises in the Sanglakh Range in Afghanistan, separated from the watershed of the Helmand by the Unai Pass. It is the main river in the eastern part of Afghanistan. It flows 700 km before joining the Indus River near Attock. It passes through the cities of Kabul, Chaharbagh, Jalalabad, and (flowing into Pakistan some 30 km north of the Khyber Pass) Nowshera. The major tributaries of the Kabul River are the Logar, Panjshir, Kunar and Alingar and Bara rivers.

The Kabul river itself is little more than a trickle for most of the year, but swells in summer due to melting snows. Its largest tributary is the Kunar River, which starts out as the Mastuj River, flowing from the Chiantar glacier in Chitral, Pakistan and once it flows south into Afghanistan it is met by the Bashgal river flowing from Nurestan. The Kunar meets the Kabul near Jalalabad. In spite of the Kunar carrying more water than the Kabul, the river continues as the Kabul River after this confluence, mainly for the political and historical significance of the name.

Kunar River

The Kunar River (Kunar Rud) is about 480 km long, located in eastern Afghanistan and north-western Pakistan. The Kunar river system is fed from melting glaciers and snow of the Hindu Kush mountains. The Lutkho River joins the Mastuj River just north of the important regional centre of Chitral in Pakistan and is then called the Chitral River, before flowing south into the upper Kunar Valley in Afghanistan, where it is referred to as the Kunar River.

The Kunar River empties into the Kabul River just to the east of the city of Jalalabad in Afghanistan. The combined rivers then flow eastwards into Pakistan. Then it becomes known as the Chitral River, joining the Indus River at the city of Attock.

The Peche River is located in Afghanistan. The Peche river system is fed from glaciers and snow. It includes the Kunar River, which rises in Nuristan province of Afghanistan, and the main Kunar River, which rises in the eastern Pamir Mountains before flowing through Chitral in Pakistan into the upper Kunar Valley in Afghanistan.

<doc id="121208" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121208" title="Direct-to-video">
Direct-to-video

A movie that is released direct-to-video (also known as made-for-video, straight-to-video, more recently, straight-to-DVD) is one which has been released to the public on home video formats (historically VHS) before or without being released in movie theaters or broadcast on television. The term is also at times used as an insulting term for sequels of movies that are not expected to have financial success.

Direct-to-video releases can occur for several reasons. Often a production studio will develop a TV show or movie which is not generally released for several possible reasons: poor quality, lack of support from a TV network, controversial nature, or a simple lack of general public interest. Studios, limited in the annual number of movies they grant cinematic releases to, may choose to pull the completed movie from the theaters, or never exhibit it in theaters at all. Studios then recoup some of their losses through video sales and rentals.

In the case of a TV show, low ratings may cause a studio to cancel the show, possibly after having filmed an entire season and aired some episodes. If the show has a considerable fanbase, the studio may release unaired episodes on video to recoup losses. "" and "Firefly" are examples of canceled shows which were successful cult hits on DVD. Occasionally outstanding DVD sales may revive a canceled show, as in the case of "Family Guy".Originally canceled in 2004,the series was revived in 2005 due partly to its excellent DVD sales.

Direct-to-video releases have historically carried a stigma of lower technical or artistic quality than theatrical releases. Some studio movies released direct-to-video are movies which have been completed but were never released. This delay often occurs when a studio doubts a movie's commercial prospects would justify a full cinema release, or because its "release window" has closed. A release window refers to a timely trend or personality, and missing that window of opportunity means a movie, possibly rushed into production, failed to release before the trend faded. In film industry slang such movies are referred to as having been "vaulted."

There is a positive side to direct-to-video releases. They have become something of a lifeline for independent filmmakers and smaller companies.

Direct-to-video releases can be done for movies which cannot be shown theatrically due to controversial content, or because the cost involved in a theatrical release is beyond the releasing company. Almost all pornographic movies are released direct-to-video.

Animated sequels and movie-length episodes of animated series are also often released in this fashion.> The Walt Disney Company began making sequels of most of its animated movies for video release beginning with "The Return of Jafar" (the sequel to "Aladdin") in 1994. Universal Studios also began their long line of "The Land Before Time" sequels that same year. In 2005, Fox released "" for DVD and Universal Media Disc.

Once in a while, a studio that makes a movie that was prepared as a direct-to-video film and release it theatrically at the last minute due to the success of another movie with a similar subject matter or an ultimate studio decision. "Doug's 1st Movie" is an example of this, quickly changed from a DTV to a theatrical release due to the surprise success of "The Rugrats Movie".

Television spin-offs are animated or live action television series or made for TV movies which contain either characters or theme elements from an older series or movie (Clerks: The Animated Series, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures). While the most common examples of a television spin off are animated series there are also live action examples (Robocop: Prime Directive)

Some "SpongeBob SquarePants" DVD volumes contain episodes not yet aired in the United States. Certain special episodes of Pokémon were released directly on video such as Pikachu’s Winter Vacation. Some Disney Channel shows, such as "That's So Raven", "The Suite Life of Zack and Cody", "Phil of the Future", and "" have also had direct-to-video episodes.

As the DVD format supplants the videocassette, companies have increasingly released movies in DVD format rather than VHS, causing the term "direct-to-DVD" to replace "direct-to-video" in some instances. However, the word "video" does not necessarily refer to VHS cassettes. The new term used is DVDP ("DVD Premiere"). Such movies can cost as much as $20 million (about a third of the average cost of a Hollywood release) and feature actors like Jean-Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal. Salaries for such actors range from $2 to $4 million (Van Damme) to $4.5 to $10 million (Seagal). According to "Variety", "" sold a million copies in one week, despite retaining only two actors from the original trilogy.

In recent years, DVD Premieres have become a substantial source of revenue for movie studios. DVDPs have collectively grossed over $3 billion over the last few years, and have matured enough that DVDP divisions of studios now option their own movies. Studios realized that DVDP movies can be shot on a smaller budget, thus allowing studios larger profits with the combined revenues of home video sales and rentals, in addition to licensing movies for television and for distribution abroad (where some DVDP movies do see theatrical releases).

Distributing DVDPs is not a practice reserved solely for larger Hollywood studios. Several companies, such as The Asylum, MTI Home Video, and York Entertainment distribute DVDPs almost exclusively. The budgets for movies distributed by these companies are even smaller than those of ones distributed by a larger studio, but these companies are still able to profit off their sales.

In Japan, the direct-to-video movement carries different connotations, being a niche product rather than a fallback medium. Despite having lower budgets than features intended for theater release, Japanese direct-to-video productions are rarely marred by the poor storyline and lower quality production often associated with the DTV market in the US. So-called V-Cinema has more respect from the public, and affection from film directors for the greater creative freedoms the medium allows. DTV releases are subject to fewer content restrictions and less creative dictate than other formats.

In the case of anime, this is called Original Video Animation (OVA or OAV), and their production values usually fall between those of television series and movies. They are often used to tell stories too short to fill a full TV season, and were particularly common in the early 1990s. Sometimes OVAs garner enough interest to justify commissioning a full television series, like "Tenchi Muyo!", "One Piece", and "El Hazard".

With the advent of the 13 episode season format, OVAs are less common now. The majority of OVAs released in today's market are usually continuations or reworkings of recently completed TV series. For instance, the DVD release of a TV series might include a bonus episode that was never broadcast as a sales hook.

<doc id="121219" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121219" title="101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure">
101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure

101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure is a direct-to-video sequel to the Disney animated movie "One Hundred and One Dalmatians", starring the voices of Martin Short, Jason Alexander, and Barry Bostwick. It was released on January 21, 2003 and won DVDX awards for best animated feature, best director, best editing, and best musical score. Disney re-released the movie on September 16, 2008.. 

The movie tells the story of Patch, the loneliest dalmatian, who felt "lost in a sea of spots" until he met his TV hero Thunderbolt. Unlike many of the Disney direct-to-video sequels that just retell the original movie's story, "101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure" takes characters from the original movie in some new directions.

The family of Roger, Anita, and the dalmatians plan to move to Dalmatian Plantation, a home in the country with plenty of room for the 101 pups and far from the clutches of Cruella de Vil, located at Cherry Tree Farm, Little Devon. One of the dalmatians, Patch, feels lost in a sea of spots and wants to be a one-of-a-kind wonder dog like his TV hero, Thunderbolt. While watching the Thunderbolt Adventure Hour, Patch hears about a chance to appear on the show while it's filming in London. However, the family move will cause a problem for Patch's opportunity. However, he is accidentally left behind in the commotion. Patch heads for the audition to meet his hero and find out if he one of a kind, or just one of 101.

Meanwhile, Thunderbolt's "trusty" sidekick, Lil' Lightning, tells Thunderbolt the producers want to replace him with a younger dog. In order to save his job, Thunderbolt decides he will go into the real world and perform an act of true heroism to prove himself. A relible reference book to Thunderbolt's many adventures, Patch provides the perfect guide for the TV star in his attempts at real-life heroics. As for Cruella - she's back and more obsessed with Dalmatians than ever. At first, an artist named Lars can calm her down, but he can't make the perfect spot painting, so she locks him up and returns to her old ways. Lil 'lightning tells Thunderbolt and Patch that Thunderbolt was not going to be replaced but it is just a trick to make him quit once and for all and make Lightning the star. Patch becomes heartbroken when he finds out that his favorite wonderdog just a TV actor.


The main character, a small dalmatian puppy with a large black patch over one of his eyes; hence his name. He feels lonely and left-out oftentimes with his family, thinking that he is just one of 101, and wants a chance to become separate and leave the shadow of his brothers and sisters behind. He quickly befriends Thunderbolt, the TV wonder-dog whom he adores.
The famous TV wonder-dog, a handsome German Shepard. As the movie opens, it is shown that Thunderbolt is not exactly bright, and very self-centered and rude to his side-kick, Lil' Lightning, which eventually makes him want to get revenge. When Thunderbolt runs away, tricked by Lightning that the director of his famous show plans to kill him off, he runs into Patch, and the two quickly bond, trying to do heroic things to prove that Thunderbolt is a real hero. As the moovie progresses, Thunderbolt becomes a father-like figure to Patch, and loses his starry-eyed, naive ways to become a strong, brave, and faithful dog.

Thunderbolt's little sidekick. Eventually Lightning becomes angry at always crawling in Thunderbolt's shadow, and tricks the German Shepard into running away, then planning to convence the director into re-writing the show slanted towards Lightning. When Thunderbolt and Patch return, endangering Lightning's chance at fame, he reveals himself to be the traitor he is and has the two dogs locked away. In the end, however, he is over-powered and taken away by the pound.


A stylish but rather strange artist who loves nothing more than painting spots. It is suggested he had some romantic feelings towards Cruella De Vil, but when she captures the dalmatian puppies again and plans to break her rules of goodness and make coats out of them, he rebels, only to be tied up. 

The villain of the original One Hundred and One Dalmatians, back once again to kidnaps the puppies.

Father (and adopted father) of the 99 Dalmatian puppies, he is loving but distracted, something here that forces Patch to feel lonely and just one of 101, instead of standing out. 

Mother (and adopted mother) of the 99 Dalmatian puppies, Perdita is a gentle, loving soul who only wants the best for her children (and adopted children), and is horrified to find her children missing once again.

The Simple Stub Project is essentially a project to determine when a new should be created. Initially, only very few stub types should be created for common topics such as writers, actors, bio's, etcetera. Only when a particular category has exceeded in maintaining an appropriate level of articles, will new stub types be created.

Articles should only temporarily sit in the category of for a brief period of time. Further categorization is needed to locate the stubs you prefer to expand. Locating these easily will be a benefit to this project.

New stub types need to be addressed on the talk page before creating. If you want a new type created, please make sure that we have at least 250 stubs to put into the category before posting.

Stubs are only meant to stay in the category temporarily. This is where sorting comes in. When you spot an article that only has on it, but may be a biographical article, you can add to it, and this will make it easier for editors to locate a stub article. Your edit summary can look like this:

This will let others know what you are doing, and advertise our project, so that others may help.

While sorting stubs, if you notice something wrong with the article, try to fix it while sorting. Any problems such as an article needing a cat, image, infobox, commonscat (or sisterlinks), or even something as simple as bolding the first appearance of the subjects title in the intro.

Troy was a powerful kingdom in the Mediterranean sea, and thrived under the long rule of King Priam. His many sons, including the valiant, strong, unbeatable Hektor, and Paris, a creative character who was not a strong fighter but a passionate man, are the best known in the Troy myth. 

In Greece lay a Kingdom called Mycene, owned by Mycenaean or Mykene people, ruled by King Agamemnon. He started a campaign to pressure the Greece cities or kingdoms and to join him and attack Troy, to capture its many riches. The King of Ithaca, Odysseus (or Ulysses as he was also known), along with King Idomenous of Crete, with up to 22 more Kingdoms and Kings, spent ten years attacking Troy. Eventually, Troy fell after a coup that Odysseus had thought up, using a wooden trojan horse to hide soldiers within in order to get soldiers behind the Trojan line of defence.

Before the fall of Troy, during the dawn of the War, King Priam sought to create an alliance with the strong Kingdom of Sparta in Northern Greece, to defend Troy when the war had begun. King Aeneas, or Helikaon as he was said to be known, King of Dardanos, was a good friend of Hektor and King Priam, and sided with the Trojans in the war. Unfortunately, on the journey back, after Hektor and Paris had forged an alliance in Sparta, Paris had taken the daughter of the King of Sparta, Princess Helen, without his consent, as they had fallen deeply in love. This had caused the alliance to be terminated, and Sparta eventually joined the fighting cause of King Agammenon.

Federal Information Processing Standard

Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are standards made by the United States Federal government for non-military government agencies and by government contractors to use, and they are announced to the public.

Many FIPS standards are modified versions of standards used in the wider community (ANSI, IEEE, ISO, etc.) 

Some FIPS standards were originally developed by the U.S. government. For instance, standards for encoding data (e.g. country codes), but more significantly some encryption standards, such as the Data Encryption Standard (FIPS 46) and the Advanced Encryption Standard (FIPS 197).

Maggot

A maggot is the common name of the larval phase of development in insects of the order Diptera (flies). Sometimes the word is used to describe the larval stage of any insect. It is also the label for Slipknot fans.

While large maggots only eat necrotic tissue in living animals and can be symbiotic, certain types of maggots are parasitic, like the Botfly larvae. These larvae spend part of their life cycle as parasites under the skin of living animals. As a result myiasis will take place in the host causing symptoms like sores and irritating lesions and even death.

Undertow (Tool album)

Undertow is Tool's first full-length album, released in 1993. When this album was released, grunge music was at its most popular, and pop punk was slowly beginning to become popular. "Undertow" helped heavy metal music continue as a leading mainstream musical style, and allowed several later bands to break through to the mainstream. Allmusic saw the album's success in the "striking, haunting visuals that complemented the album's nihilistic yet wistful mood." It was eventually certified double platinum by the RIAA on May 14, 2001.

The album was recorded between October and December 1992 at Grand Master Studios, Hollywood, California, and includes songs that the band decided to not release on their previous EP, "Opiate".

All songs written by Tool unless otherwise noted.

"Disgustipated" is track 69 on most pressings in North America (causing most CD players upon reaching the end of track 9 to advance through tracks 10-68, which contain no data, at a rate of about 2 per second until track 69 is reached). It also appears as track 39, track 10 (mostly in Europe) or as a hidden track following "Flood" on track 9.
On certain Japanese imports, "Disgustipated" is track 70, with a short live version of "Flood" as track 71.

Trumpet Concerto (Arutunian)

Arutunian Trumpet Concerto is Armenian composer Alexander Arutunian’s sixth major composition. It was written for the Soviet trumpet player Timofei Dokschitzer, who moved to the USA and represented the concerto there. According to J. Sundram, "it is an energetic powerhouse of Eastern European lyricism and harmonic textures". According to Philip Smith, the principal trumpet of the New York Philharmonic, Arutunian's Trumpet Concerto is too much popular among the trumpet players.

Arutiunian's Trumpet Concerto consists of the following movements:

Alexander Arutiunian (born September 23 1920,Yerevan) is an Armenian composer and pianist, widely-known particularly for his Trumpet concerto. He was awarded by the State Prizes of USSR (1949) and Armenia (1970), People's Artist of the USSR (1970) and Armenian SSR (1964) honorary titles, "St Mesrop Mashtots" and "Khorenatsi" Armenian medals, "Alexandrov" Gold medal (1976), "St Sahak and St Mesrop" Order by Holy Etchmiadzin (2004).

He graduated from the Music Conservatory of Yerevan, then he studied composition with Genrikh Litinsky. After graduation he returned to Yerevan to teach at the local Conservatory and later he became artistic director of the Armenian Philarmonic Orchestra.

In 1948 he was awarded the USSR State Prize for the "Motherland" cantata, a graduation piece he wrote as a student at the Moscow Conservatory. He has continued to win acclaim at home and abroad for his works, many of which are quickened by the folk traditions of Armenian music. 

Some of Arutiunian's works for wind instruments, notably the 1950 concerto for trumpet, the concerto for tuba, and the brass quintet "Armenian Scenes", have secured their place in the international repertory, having been performed by conductors such as Valeri Gergiev, who has recorded his Symphony for large orchestra, composed in 1957 with the Symphony orchestra of the Russian All-Union Radio. In 1988, he composed his Violin Concerto "Armenia-88".

Epicurus

Epicurus (Samos, 341 BC – Athens, 270 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher, and the founder of a school of philosophy called Epicureanism. 

As a boy he studied philosophy under the Platonist teacher Pamphilus for about four years. At the age of 18 he went to Athens for his two-year term of military service. Epicurus never married and had no known children.

Epicurus helped in the development of science and the scientific method because of his insistence that nothing should be believed except that which was tested through direct observation and logical deduction. Many of his ideas about nature and physics presaged important scientific concepts of our time.

Epicurus' only surviving complete works are three letters, which are to be found in book X of Diogenes Laertius' "Lives of Eminent Philosophers", and two groups of quotes: the "Principal Doctrines", reported as well in Diogenes' book X, and the "Vatican Sayings", preserved in a manuscript from the Vatican Library.

Many pieces of his thirty-seven volume treatise "On Nature" have been found in the burnt papyrus fragments at the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum.

The Hundred and One Dalmatians

The Hundred and One Dalmatians, or the Great Dog Robbery is a 1956 children's novel by Dodie Smith. Smith wrote a sequel called "The Starlight Barking". In the book, after being invited to a dinner party by the Dearly couple, where Cruella de Vil expresses her dislike for animals, the family's new Dalmatian puppies disappear. The Dearly dogs are added to 97 puppies who are kidnapped or legally purchased from various owners, all of which have been gathered with the intent of skinning them for their fur, to make a coat. Through a fellowship of animals and the "Twilight Barking", the dogs are identified as being in Suffolk and a rescue ensues.

The book was made into a Disney animated movie in 1961, under the title "One Hundred and One Dalmatians". In this movie the four adult dalmatians were merged into two, with Missis being named "Perdita" and Prince being omitted totally. There is only one Nanny, who in personality and appearance resembles Nanny Cook. Patch and Lucky are present, but the Cadpig is not by name, though she is included in the Disney Channel TV series. Mr. Dearly, here named Roger Radcliffe, is a musician and composer, rather than a financial wizard like in the book. Saul Baddun is renamed Horace, and Cruella appears to be single. The villains discover the Dalmatians have stowed away on the moving truck, leading to a climactic car chase.

The book has been released under the title "101 Dalmatians" at least as far back as a 1989 Egmont UK Ltd release.

<doc id="121286" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121286" title="Coulomb's law">
Coulomb's law

Coulomb's law is a function developed in the 1780s by physicist Charles Augustin de Coulomb. It explains how strong the force will be between two electrostatic charges. Electrostatic means electric charges without any motion.

Let's think two electric charges exist in an empty space. If two charges are opposite, (+) and (-) charges for example, they will attract each other. And if two charges are both the same, both (+) or both (-) for example, they will push each other. This is similar to how magnetics act, as N and S attract each other, and as N and N, S and S push each other.

This is because electric charges make an electric field, such as magnetics make a magnetic field. When both electric charges make their own field, as two fields will exist in one space at the same time, and they will make force to each other. The force they make to each other is called Coulomb's force or Electrostatic force. Coulomb's law explains how big the force will be.

Coulomb's law explains the scale between two electric charges.
The scale of electrostatic force follows the function below.
Coulomb's law explains that the force scale F is relative to ratio of formula_2,formula_3.

formula_4 and formula_5 are scale of each electric charges. formula_6 is distance between two electric charges. And formula_7 has a certain value. It does not change relative to formula_4 , formula_5 or formula_6. While formula_11 remains constant, when multiples of formula_4 and formula_5 become bigger, the electrostatic force will also get bigger. When the distance formula_6 become bigger, the electrostatic force will become smaller to ratio of formula_3.
The exact size of formula_7 is
formula_17
formula_18N m C (or m F). This constant is called as Coulomb's Force Constant or Electrostatic Force Constant.

The relation between the force F and the distance formula_6 follows the Inverse-square Law. Inverse-square law means means that when the distance formula_6 grow bigger, electrostatic force will become smaller to ratio of formula_3. Gravitation, Electromagnetic radiation, Sound Intensity also follows this law.

Underwater is a term telling what is below the surface of a body of water such as an ocean, sea, lake, pond, or river. Most of the planet Earth is covered by water. The bottom of the ocean is called the sea-bed. Most of the sea-bed is between 4000 and 5500 m (13,000 to 18,000 ft) below the surface of the ocean. Just like the Earth's dry land, the sea-bed also has mountains, valleys and flat plains, although they are covered with water. The deepest part of all the world's oceans is a place called the Challenger Deep, which is in the Mariana Trench. It is 10,924 m (35,838 ft) under the sea.

Hereford cattle are a widely used breed in temperate areas, mainly for beef production.

Originally from Herefordshire, England , they are found in the temperate parts of Australia. The breed also enjoys great popularity among ranchers in the desert American Southwest of the United States, as well as in the centre and east of Argentina and in Uruguay. Herefords made up the largest percentage of registered cows among herders in New Zealand. This is a testament to the hardiness of the breed; while originating in cool, moist Britain, they have thrived in much harsher climates. The breed has adapted to a wide range of climates on nearly every continent.

Hornless variants with the polled gene are known as the Polled Herefords. Breeding horned and hornless together functions as a genetic dehorner. This is often used as an alternative to a dehorning process, which causes stress and often weight loss.

Roman army

The Roman army is the military of ancient Rome, the forces used by the Roman Kingdom, Roman Republic and later Roman Empire. Its infantry for much of its history, was the Roman legion. Rome also had a navy. The size of the army in the late Roman Empire was about 128,000 - 179,200 men. It was very well organized. The main Roman soldiers in the Empire were the legionaries. There were, of course, other soldiers in the army; these were called the auxilia. Auxilia were non-citizens who mainly came from the provinces. They were paid less than legionaries but at the end of their service they were given Roman citizenship.

In an early to mid-Republican era, legionaries usually bought their own gear. "Hastati", the first line of soldiers, usually had breastplates, called a "cuirass", and some wore "lorica hamata", or chainmail. The richer principes, the second line of soldiers, could afford lorica hamata but they were sometimes seen wearing the cheaper cuirasses. Both hastati and principes were each armed with a "gladius" - a short, 60 centimeter sword - and each had two "pila" - short spears. The third line of soldiers, the Triarii, had a purple pandas eat pink pigs!!!! "hasta", a two meter long spear. They were also armed with the gladius and had an early form of the "lorica segmenta" or iron band armor. All legionaries had a large rectangular shield, the "scutum", which had rounded corners.
By the late Republican period, all legionaries carried a gladius, two pila, a new, larger scutum, and wore chainmail. Lorica segmenta was only commonly worn between the 2nd and 3rd century AD.

The roman soldiers had to do many hard tasks to get in the army.Like running a Marathon.
The main thing a member of the Roman Army needed was fitness. Soldiers were expected to march about 36km (24 miles) in 5 hours. They also had to be fit to be able to fight well and cope with any injuries.

New soldiers would do two sessions what military drill and give their oath of loyalty to their Commander and Emperor. Every day the whole of the legion would practice running, jumping, sword fighting and javelin throwing.

Tierpark Hagenbeck

Tierpark Hagenbeck (translated as Animal park Hagenbeck) is the name of the largest zoo in Hamburg, Germany. The park was founded by Carl Hagenbeck in 1907. His father was a fishmonger (a person who buys and sells fish). It is the first zoo in the world to use moats (a moat is a large hole or trench. Animals do not dare cross it).
This was done instead of using cages with bars, so the animals would feel more at home. 

Bombs in the Second World War completely destroyed the zoological garden. With much help from the founding family, it was rebuilt after the war. Two Indian Elephants helped to clear the rubble in the zoo.

There are 210 different species in the Tierpark Hagenbeck. The sadness is the only swan which is almost completely black, the Mourning swan. There are also mandrills and baby elephants but no tapir. There is breeding for Orangutan, North Chinese leopard and giant otters from South America.

Arthur Phillip

Admiral Arthur Phillip RN (11 October 1738 – 31 August 1814) was a British naval officer. Phillip was made Governor of New South Wales, the first European colony in Australia, which is now the city of Sydney.

Arthur (Kriddler) Phillip was born in Fulham, London, in 1738. His father was a German-born language teacher, Jacob Phillip. His mother, Elizabeth Breach, was English, and the widow of a navy captain. Phillip went to a school for poor boys at the Greenwich Hospital. At the age of 13 he joined the merchant navy. Phillip joined the Royal Navy at 15. He saw action during the Seven Years' War in the Mediterranean at the Battle of Minorca in 1756. In 1762 he was promoted to Lieutenant. When the war ended in 1763 he was put on half pay. He married and became a farmer in Lyndhurst, Hampshire. He separated from his wife about six years later.

In 1774 Phillip joined the Portuguese Navy as a captain. He served in the Spanish-Portuguese War, 1776–1777. Phillip took a group of convict ships from Portugal to Brazil. This trip was a success because not many people died. This may have been one of the reasons Phillip was asked to lead the expedition to Australia. In 1778 England was at war again, and Phillip was recalled to active service. In 1779 he was given his first command, the ship "Basilisk". He was promoted to captain in 1781, and given command of the "Ariadne". In 1782 he was captain of the "Europe" with his friend Philip Gidley King as his lieutenant. They sailed to India. In 1784 he was back on half pay in England. He spent time in southern France and in 1786 was doing survey work for the Royal Navy.

In October 1786, Phillip was made Governor of New South Wales. The British government wanted to start a penal colony (prison) on the east coast of Australia. Phillip knew about farming, and had taken prisoners to Brazil for the Portuguese. This made him a good choice to be leader. Phillip had a very hard time getting the ships ready for the eight month sea voyage to Australia. He had to take everything that the new colony might need. Phillip had no real idea of what he might find when he got there. There wasn't much money to buy things. He wanted people who knew about farming, building and making things, but this was rejected. Most of the 772 convicts (prisoners) were thieves from the city area of London. Phillip also took a group of marines (soldiers) and small group of officers who were to help him run the new colony.

The First Fleet, of 11 ships, sailed on 13 May 1787. The first ship, "HMS Supply", reached Botany Bay on 18 January 1788. Phillip soon decided that this site, picked by Sir Joseph Banks, was not suitable. It had poor soil, no safe place to leave the ships, and no drinking water. Phillip decided to go north to Port Jackson. On 26 January 1788 (this day is now called Australia Day the marines and convicts landed at Sydney Cove. It was a successful trip, as only 40 convicts had died. Phillip named Sydney after Lord Sydney.

The first years of the settlement were very hard. They only had the supplies they brought with them. They had to start growing their own food, but the soil around Sydney was poor. They didn't know about the climate, how much rain or when it would fall for example. Very few of the convicts knew anything about farming or growing food. They did not have enough farming tools. The convicts did not want to be farm workers. The colony was in danger of starvation for long time. The soldiers, who didn't like being given orders in many cases, did not think it was their job to make the convicts work. Phillip had to put some convicts in charge (overseers) to get the other convicts working. This was the start of the process of making some convicts free which led to the reforms of Lachlan Macquarie after 1811. As Governor of the new settlement, Phillip had complete power over the eastern half of Australia.

Phillip had respect from the Aboriginal people because he was missing a front tooth. This tooth was the same tooth that they knocked out as part of their initiation ceremonies.

Phillip soon had problems with the soldiers in the penal colony. Life in Sydney was difficult, without proper houses and not enough food. The officer in charge of the soldiers, Major Robert Ross, wanted to give up the settlement and go back to England. Ross complained about Phillip and wrote letters to the government in England about him. The soldiers thought they should be given land and other benefits. They thought they should be given more food than the convicts, but Phillip believed everyone should have an equal share. Ross and the soldiers believed that they were in Australia to protect the settlement from being attacked by other countries. They did not think that their work included guarding the convicts. Ross who was a soldier, did not think he should have to take orders from Phillip, who was a navy man. In March 1790, Phillip finally sent Ross to be in charge of the colony on Norfolk Island. The British government continued to send out convicts, there were over 4000 in Sydney by 1792. Food still needed to be brought in as the colony could not yet grow enough. Phillip began giving small grants of land to ex-convicts to start farms around Parramatta, New South Wales.

On 11 December 1792 Phillip left to go back to England. He needed medical treatment for a pain in his side. The pain was kidney pain from eating so much salted food. He planned to return to Australia, but on medical advice he resigned as Governor and stayed in England. He married Isabella Whitehead in 1794. He eventually got better and in 1796 returned to the navy as a captain. He was in charge of the "Alexander", and later the 74 gun battleship, "Swiftshore". In January 1799 he was made a Rear Admiral of the Blue, and put in charge of the Sea Fencibles. Their job was to defend England against Napoleon. He retired from active service in 1805. He had a number of strokes which left him partly paralysed. He died at Bath, on 31 August 1814, after falling from a third floor window. He was buried at the church of St.Nicholas, Bathampton.

In 2007 Geoffrey Robertson QC found that Phillip's remains are no longer in the church. It is not known where they are. It is believed they were lost while the church was being repaired in the 1970's. Robertson believes that it is a insult to Phillip that he wasn't buried in one of England's cathedrals. He wants the remains of Phillip found and brought back to Australia.

Halting problem

The Halting problem is a computer science problem that poses the question, 'is there a program that can find out if any given program will run forever?'

For example, a program like this:

will loop forever, but the program

stops very quickly.

If we have a function "stops(x)" that takes a program x and returns true if x stops. Then we can make a program like this:

This program takes program x and runs for ever if x does not run for ever.

But the value of "stops" depends on what x it is given. 

What happens if we run program p on itself? p must work on every possible program, so it must be able to work on program p, so we can say p runs for ever if p does not run for ever. 

This is clearly impossible and was used by Alan Turing in 1936 to prove that there is no program that solves the halting problem.

<doc id="121420" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121420" title="Scottish Fold">
Scottish Fold

The Scottish Fold (sometimes called Coupari by Canadian breeders) is a breed of cat. Its distinctive ear fold is caused by a particular gene .

First known as Flops, for their "floppy" ears, Scottish Fold became the breed's name in 1966. Scottish Folds with long hair are known by a number of names. For example, it is called the Highland Fold by the ACFA, AACE, and UFO; the Scottish Fold Longhair by the TICA, NCFA, ACA, CCA, and CFA; and the Longhair Fold by the CFF.

The very first Scottish Fold was a long-haired barn cat with white fur, called Susie. She was found in 1961 at a farm near Coupar Angus in Perthshire, Scotland. Susie's ears had an unusual fold in the middle, making her look like an owl. When Susie had kittens, two of them were born with the distinctive folded ears. One was owned by William Ross, a nearby farmer and cat-lover. Ross registered the breed with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy in Great Britain and started to breed Scottish Fold kittens with the help of Pat Turner. The breeding program ended up with 76 kittens in the first three years, 42 with folded ears. They suspected that that the ear mutation was from a dominant allele. This means that if one parent has straight ears, and one parent has folded ears, half of the kittens will be Folds.

Susie's only fertile offspring was a female Fold named Snooks, also white like her mother. A second kitten was neutered shortly after birth. Three months after Snooks' birth, Susie was killed by a car. All Scottish Fold cats are related to Susie and Snooks. This kind of ancestry is very rare, even among pedigreed animals.

The breed was not accepted for showing in Great Britain and Europe because people thought that they would be overly prone to ear problems such as infection, mites, and deafness, but the Folds were sold in America. The breed kept on growing using crosses with British Shorthairs and American Shorthairs. Despite the initial concerns, the Fold breed has not had the expected mite and infection problems. However, wax can build up faster than in the ears of other cats.

Folds are very popular pets because of their unique look, and their reputation as particularly loving companions. Fold kittens are usually much more expensive to buy than kittens of more common breeds.

All Folds are born with straight, unfolded ears. Cats that have the Fold gene will start to show the fold before 21 days. The first cats only had one fold in their ears. With careful breeding, breeders have changed the fold to a double or triple fold. This causes the ear to lie totally flat against the head.

Folds are a medium-sized breed of cat (9-13 lbs. for males and 6-9 lbs. for females). They have round bodies, round heads, and round faces. They have big round eyes. Their noses are short with a gentle curve. They have medium to short sized legs. Their heads are curved at the top. They have very short necks. The eyes have a big gap which gives the Scottish Fold a "sweet expression".

Scottish Folds can be either long- or short-haired. They may have nearly any coat colour or mix of colours (including white) except pointed colours. According to cat-fancy website Terrific-Cats.com:
Scottish Folds, whether with folded ears or with normal ears, are normally good-natured and calm. They can adjust to other animals within a household very well. They tend to become very attached to their human caregivers. They are by nature quite loving. Folds receive high marks for playfulness, affection, and grooming. They are often clever, loyal, quiet, and do well in changing home situations.

Folds are also known for sleeping on their backs. Scottish Folds normally have soft voices. They can give a mix of meows and purrs not found in better-known breeds.

Scottish Folds usually live for around 15 years.
Scottish folds can easily get polycystic kidney disease (PKD), osteochondritis, and cardiomyopathy.

Because the ears fold nearly a month after birth, Fold kittens cannot be judged straight away as to their type or value, as the animal website PetFinder.com says:
One special medical problem comes in the Scottish Fold if both parents have folded ears. In such a case, their kittens will be very likely (1:4 ratio, or usually at least one per litter) to have a painful joint disease that can fuse the tail, ankles and/or knees. Scientists think the disease is caused by the dominant (folded-ear) gene. It is more likely to affect Folds with the gene twice, than mixed single with one recessive (unfolded-ear) gene. This disease can also affect Scottish Folds with one copy of the gene, but usually not as often or as badly. For this reason the breed is not accepted by either the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy or the Fédération Internationale Féline. This is the reasoning behind the widely-held belief that the only ethical manner of breeding Folds is Fold/nonfold and not Fold/Fold (in the same way Munchkins are bred).

The Scottish Fold is one of the main focuses in the short novel "The Cat Who Went to Paris" by Peter Gethers. The book and its two sequels, "A Cat Abroad" and "The Cat Who'll Live Forever: The Final Adventures of Norton, the Perfect Cat, and His Imperfect Human", talk about the life of Gethers and his Fold, Norton. It starts with their first meeting and ends with Norton's death and Gether's life after the loss.

Cat guides about the Scottish Fold breed can be found. For example "Scottish Fold Cats: A Complete Pet Owner's Manual" (ISBN 0812049993), "Guide to Owning a Scottish Fold Cat" (ISBN 079382172X), and "Scottish Fold Cats (Cats Set III)" (ISBN 1577658671).

The Sims 3

The Sims 3 is a computer game for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. It was released on June 2, 2009 and is a sequel to the popular "The Sims" and "The Sims 2" computer games. There have been versions of the game for consoles and mobile phones as well. "The Sims 3" was a success right when it was released. The game 1.4 million copies in its first week and has sold over ten million copies worldwide to date.

The Sims 3 is made with the same concept as the games before it. The player controls their own Sims in activities and relationships in a similar manner to real life. The game play is open-ended and has no limits. Sim houses and neighborhoods are entirely in one huge map. The developers stated, "What you do outside your home now matters as much as what you do within." The game includes an optional feature called "Story Progression", which allows all Sims in the neighborhood to continue on their own as if the player were controlling them, such as grow up, get married, get jobs and promotions, have children, and build or buy their dream house while the player isn't playing. The Sims 2 used a reward system called Wants and Fears. This is replaced with a new system called Wishes in The Sims 3. Fulfilling a Sim's wish helps to the Sim's Lifetime Happiness score and mood. Some wishes, such as "Go to the Park", may add little points to their lifetime happiness while "Have A Baby Boy" may add thousands of points. In The Sims 2, Wants and Fears also contributed to a Sim's "Aspiration" meter, the same to current self-esteem. In The Sims 3, Aspiration is removed entirely, replaced with "Moodlets", which contribute positive or negative values to the original Motivation meter. Moodlets can be inspired by physical events, such as having a good meal or comfort from sitting in a good chair, as well as emotional events like a first kiss or a break-up. Most moodlets last for a set duration, but some negative Moodlets can be cured (such as the one incurred by an urgent need to urinate) and some positive ones rely on the Sim's surroundings and traits.

Heston was also known for his politics. When he was young he held liberal views and marched with people such as Martin Luther King, Jr. for civil rights in the 1960s. It was rare for a Hollywood actor to be for such causes at that time. Later in his life, he was for conservative causes such as gun rights. He was president of the National Rifle Association, a group that is for the rights of gun owners, from 1998 to 2003.

Ambush marketing

Ambush marketing is a form of marketing. Many events, especially in sports have sponsors. These sponsors pay money, which makes it possible to hold the event. In return for this, they get publicity and media coverage. Ambush marketing is a name given to marketing campaigns that are also done around the event, but where no money is paid for the event.
There are many very important events where one company will pay money to become the "exclusive sponsor" of the event (or in a category of the event). This creates a problem for other brands or companies. These other brands then find ways to promote themselves in connection with the same event. They do not pay the sponsorship fee. Even if they wanted to, they could not, because one brand is the exclusive sponsor. They also do not break any laws.


For the 2011 Rugby World Cup and the 2015 Cricket World Cup, New Zealand is planning to make laws to combat ambush marketing, according to former Sports Minister Trevor Mallard.

Achaemenid Empire

The Achaemenid Empire, or "Achaemenid Persian Empire", (550–330 BC) was the first of the Persian Empires to rule over significant portions of Greater Persia (or Iran). It followed the Median Empire as the second great empire of the Iranian peoples. At the height of its power, the Achaemenid Empire had about 7.5 million square kilometers and was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity.

The empire was forged by Cyrus the Great. It spanned three continents, including parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan; parts of Central Asia, Asia Minor, Thrace; much of the Black Sea coastal regions; Iraq, northern Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Syria; and all significant population centers of ancient Egypt as far west as Libya. The empire was the foe of the Greek city states in the Greco-Persian Wars. It freed the Israelites from their Babylonian captivity, and instituted Aramaic as the empire's official language. Because of the Empire's vast extent and long endurance, Persian influence upon the language, religion, architecture, philosophy, law and government of nations around the world lasts to this day.

The empire began as a tributary state of the Medes but ended up conquering and enlarging the Median empire to include Egypt and Asia Minor. Under Xerxes, it came very close to conquering Ancient Greece. The Achaemenids were overthrown by the conquest of Alexander the Great in 330 BCE.

It was directed by Christopher Nolan. It is the sequel to the 2005 movie "Batman Begins". "The Dark Knight" broke many records on its release.

The movie begins with the Joker and his gang of clowns robbing a mob bank. The other clowns shoot each other so that there are fewer people so they can get more money per person. The manager of the bank takes out his shotgun and shoots one of them. The Joker takes off his mask and kills the last clown, leaving all the money for himself. He then drives away in a school bus.

The crime mob in the city is very mad at the Joker for robbing the bank. The Joker comes to them and says he wants to kill Batman, a person who wears a mask and fights crime. Meanwhile, Gotham city's District Attorney Harvey Dent tries to shut the mob down by tracking down the money. A businessman named Lau finds out about this and takes the money out beforehand and goes to Hong Kong so that he cannot be caught. Batman, whose real name is Bruce Wayne, flies down there himself, kidnaps him, and takes him back to Gotham City.

The Joker says he wants Batman to take his mask off and show the world who he is, and that if he does not, people will die. Commissioner Loeb dies from drinking acid and the judge that was at the mob trials is killed. The Joker then hires some men to kidnap police officers and take their uniforms. At Loeb's funeral, Joker's men attempt to shoot the mayor. Police officer James Gordon tackles the mayor and is shot and killed.

Dent then calls a press conference to ask the people there if he should reveal Batman. After they say yes, Dent says that he is Batman and has the police arrest him. They put him on a truck to send him to jail. The Joker and his men drive a truck that badly damages the truck Dent is riding in. The real Batman comes in and attempts to save Dent but wrecks his motorcycle-like Batpod when the Joker stands there, since Batman has a rule that he will not kill anyone. Gordon, who is revealed to have faked his death, arrests the Joker.

In jail, Batman questions the Joker. The Joker eventually reveals that his men captured Rachel Dawes, Batman's old childhood friend and Dent's girlfriend, and Dent. He has put them in warehouses far away so that Batman cannot save both of them himself. They are near bombs that will go off and kill them. The Joker tells Batman where each person is. Batman goes to save Dawes while Gordon and his men go to rescue Dent. However, when Batman gets to Rachel's location, he only sees Dent, because the Joker switched the addresses. Batman gets Dent out, but the bomb goes off and Dent scars half of his face. Gordon is too late to save Dawes.

The Joker gets out of jail. He gets his phone call and dials a cell phone that is wired to a bomb, which blows up the police station. Afterwards, he visits the hopsital where Dent is staying. Dent is driven crazy because of Dawes' death. The Joker frees Dent and tells him to take revenge. Dent goes around flipping coins and decides whether he will kill them or keep them alive. He starts going after the various police people who leaked information to the Joker to make it possible for him to kidnap and kill Dawes.

The Joker then announces that the city is his. The people in charge load up two ferries with people to get them out of the city. The Joker has wired both boats with explosives and has given each boat the detonator to the other one, saying that he will blow up both boats at midnight if one boat does not blow up the other.

Batman finds the Joker in an abandoned building. He uses a sonar system to defeat the Joker's men and stops him from destroying both ferries. He then leaves the Joker hanging. The Joker is very impressed, stating that Batman cannot be corrupted into breaking his own rule. A SWAT team then captures the Joker.

At the end of the movie, Batman finds that Dent has kidnapped Gordon's family. When Batman arrives, Dent flips his coin to decide their fates. before he can see the result of his next coin flip, Batman tackles Dent off the edge of the building, letting the vigilante plummet to his death. With Dent dead, Gordon says that if word gets out that Dent killed all these people, all the work he did will have been lost. Batman offers to take the blame for all the murders. Gordon, who is originally against it, agrees. He destroys the Bat-Signal and orders the police to hunt Batman down.

Gorgon

In Greek mythology, the Gorgons were female monsters that had fangs and serpents for hair with bronze claws. They were the daughters of Phorkys and Keto. The serpents in their hair were special: Everyone who looked at them was turned to stone. There were three Gorgons, named Stheno, Euryale and Medusa. Only Medusa was mortal. She was beheaded by Perseus. Medusa's head was brought to Athena. There are many motives showing Athena with an aegis, and a Gorgon's head on her chest. 

Homer only talks about one Gorgon. Hesiod names all three, Stheno, the powerful one, Euryale,who could jump far, and trouble-ridden Medusa, the queen. According to Hesiod, they lived at the edge of the known world, in the Atlas Mountains. At a later time, Libya is also named as their home.

With Hellenism came the myth that the Gorgo was a sister of Alexander the Great. In this myth, she is a neck, a water spirit. The sailors of each passing boat are asked whether he is still alive. If they answer no, she takes the boat and the sailors into the water. The answer that saves the lives of the semen is "Yes, and he reigns as a king" (Greek: Ζεί και βασιλέβει). 

The heads of the Gorgons are often found on shields, capes and amulets. These were believed to be magic. The magic that is used against bad spirits and bad look is known as apotropaic magic.

As the World Turns

As the World Turns (ATWT) is an American television soap opera that airs each weekday on CBS. 

Set in the made-up town of Oakdale, Illinois, the show first went on TV on Monday, April 2, 1956 at 1:30pm EST. Before this show, all soaps were fifteen minutes in length; ATWT was the first half-hour soap opera.

At first, viewers were not excited about it, but ratings picked up in its second year, and reached the top spot in the daytime Nielsen Ratings by the fall of 1958. "As the World Turns" was the most-watched daytime drama from 1958 until 1978, with ten million people watching each day. At its height, the main actors such as Helen Wagner, Don MacLaughlin, Don Hastings, and Eileen Fulton became very well known in the United States.

The show went from black-and-white to color in the mid-1960s, with the final black-and-white episode shown on February 10 1967. The show went from a half-hour in length to one hour starting on December 1 1975. Also in 1975, they stopped doing the show live, and decided to tape it instead - that way, more than one episode could be taped in a day, and the actors would not have to work every day.

April 2, 2006 was the 50th anniversary of the soap opera on CBS. The show aired its 13,000th episode April 23, 2007; the 10,000th episode aired on May 12 1995. "As the World Turns" is well known for having been taped in New York City for all of its 52 years on television (43 years in Manhattan and nine years in Brooklyn).
On December 8, 2009, CBS announced that '"As the World Turns" would air its last episode in September 2010.

Mother (series)

Mother , is a role-playing video game series made by Nintendo, Ape, Inc., HAL Laboratory, and Brownie Brown. Shigesato Itoi was in charge of all three games. It has three main games in it, and started on the NES with "Mother", and then it had "EarthBound" on the Super NES and "Mother 3" on the Game Boy Advance. "EarthBound" is the only game of the three that came out in English, and it has a strong fanbase that wants the other two games in English too.

The series takes place in western locations for the most part, but it also goes to other places like deserts, a prehistoric world, and a dream world.

"Mother" is the first title in the "EarthBound" series. It was made by Ape, Inc. and designed by Shigesato Itoi for the NES. It was going to be called "EarthBound" in the United States, and Nintendo of America completed the translation of the game, but they decided that role-playing video games weren't very worth releasing, and that it was too late in the NES' life to release.

"EarthBound" (known as "Mother 2" in Japan) is the second title in the series. It's the most well-known because it was the only one released outside of Japan. It was made by Ape, Inc. for the Super NES. It stars a boy named Ness, a girl named Paula, a boy named Jeff, and a boy named Poo, who have to work together to defeat an evil alien called Giygas, who conquers the Earth 10 years in the future.

"Mother 3" is the third and latest "EarthBound" game. It was made by Brownie Brown and released for the Game Boy Advance. It started on the Nintendo 64 as "EarthBound 64", but got canceled since the N64 was almost done. It was announced in 2003 that it was going to move to the Game Boy Advance, and came out in 2006. It changed from 3D to 2D, but it kept the same characters and story. It never came outside of Japan because of "EarthBound"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s low sales in the United States, though there have been a lot of rumors, including one in Electronic Gaming Monthly about a game called "Mother Compilation" for the Nintendo DS which would include all three games. "Mother 3" is about the adventures of a boy named Lucas and his dog Boney, who joins up with a princess named Kumatora and a thief named Duster who have to fight the Pig Mask Army. Shigesato Itoi, the creator, has no plans to make a sequel.

Nintendo made a collection of "Mother" and "EarthBound" for the Game Boy Advance called "Mother 1 + 2". It never came out of Japan. There hasn't been another re-release of any of the games since, but "EarthBound was rated by the ESRB for a Virtual Console release.

"EarthBound" has always been in the "Super Smash Bros." series. In "Super Smash Bros.", Ness (from "EarthBound") is a playable character, using special PSI moves and attacks from "EarthBound". He appeared again in "Super Smash Bros. Melee" with some new moves, and was going to be replaced by Lucas because he was going to be the star of "EarthBound 64", but since it was canceled, he kept Ness instead. "Melee" also added stages from "EarthBound" based on two of the towns from the second game, and collectible trophies of characters and items from it. "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" brought Ness back, but also added Lucas since "Mother 3" came out. It also added a stage from "Mother 3" and new trophies too.

It was one of the most primitive members of its group, living 33 to 32 million years ago in the early Oligocene. It was quite small, averaging 5.2 lbs (2.4 kg) in weight.

Its diet probably consisted of small mammals, amphibians, reptiles and insects.

Although "Badjcinus" was successful in its period, it probably was pushed out by other, better developed thylacinids. The fossils were found at Riversleigh in north-west Queensland, Australia.

<doc id="121588" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121588" title="Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics">
Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics

The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics, (NUTS) for the French nomenclature d'unités territoriales statistiques, is a geocode standard that shows the administrative divisions of countries for statistical purposes. It was made by the European Union, so it only covers the member states of that union in detail. 

A NUTS code begins with a two-letter code referencing the country, and is identical to the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code (the only difference is "UK" instead of "GB" for the United Kingdom). The subdivision of the country is then displayed by one number. A second or third subdivision level is referred to with another number each. Each numbering starts with 1, as 0 is used for the upper level. In case the subdivision has more than 9 entities, capital letters are used to continue the numbering.

In addition to the full three levels for the European Union countries, all countries have a NUTS code with a two-letter code for a continent and two numbers for the country, and for the USA, Canada and Australia the states, provinces, and territories are numbered separately.

Some are not easily classified: for example, Gibraltar is listed as being outside the EU with the code EO21; while French Guiana is listed twice, once in France as FR930 and once in South America as AS13.

NUTS, in some ways are similar to the ISO 3166-2 standard, as well as the FIPS standard of the United States.

There are three levels of NUTS. Some with two levels of local administrative units (LAUs) below. These were called NUTS levels 4 and 5 until July 2003, but were changed due to official regulations although they are sometimes still described as such. Note that not all countries have every level of division, depending on their size. One of the most extreme cases is Luxembourg, which has only LAUs; the three NUTS divisions each correspond to the entire country itself.

Michael E. DeBakey

Michael Ellis DeBakey (September 7, 1908 – July 11, 2008) was an American heart surgeon who was considered to be a very important name in his area. He was also among the early names of heart surgery.

DeBakey was born as Michel Dabaghi in Lake Charles, Louisiana on September 7, 1908. His parents were born in Lebanon, but moved to America before he was born.

DeBakey was involved with medicine from a young age and went to Tulane University. He held many medicine-related positions during his lifetime.

During World War II, DeBakey made wartime medicine much better than it used to be. He was for the idea of having doctors closer to the areas of battle in war, which worked very well and due to that, more badly hurt soldiers survived. Because of this, Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals (also known as MASH units) were made, and they were used during the Korean War.

In addition to MASH units, DeBakey made many important aspects to surgery, one of which was the roller pump, which DeBakey made at age 23 while still at Tulane University. This would later on make open-heart surgery able to be done, as roller pumps can make blood flow during surgery.

DeBakey worked with another important heart surgeon, Denton Cooley, but they had a disagreement related to the first artifical heart(a manmade heart) put in a human. They did not get along for a long time, but they went on good terms in 2007.

DeBakey did something rare by still practicing medicine in old age. People that he operated on included world leaders, such as Russian President Boris Yeltsin.

In 2005, a serious heart problem happened to DeBakey. Despite him having made the surgery for this problem, he, at first, did not want any surgery. As he got in worse condition, the surgical team had made the decision to perform surgery anyway. Once the surgery was done and he got in better health, DeBakey said that he was glad the surgery happened after all. 

On July 11, 2008, DeBakey died of natural causes at age 99. His first wife, two of his sons, and a brother died before him, while his second wife, a daughter, two sons, and two sisters outlive him.

Fire Emblem

Fire Emblem is a series of video games made by Intelligent Systems. Nintendo began publishing the series on the NES console in 1990. Most of the games in the series were released in Japan. The games were released in North America and Europe. The series is a collection of turn-based strategy role-playing games. They used many characters going on a long journey to fight a common enemy.

In "Fire Emblem", the player moves units across a grid in turns. The player must deal with a challenge with each part in the story, for example, defeating all of the enemy units. A player may choose to fight, move, heal, or visit shops each turn. The battle system is made up of two units fighting each other with their selected weapon. Some weapons are better against others. For example, swords are better against axes. When units defeat others, they gain experience. This experience is used to "level up" the units and makes them stronger. A well known feature in "Fire Emblem" is that when a character is damaged very badly (loses all of their "hit points"), they can never be used in the game again.

Each "Fire Emblem" game is mainly set on a fictional continent, or a really large area. Some continents are used in more than one game. Six continents have been used in "Fire Emblem" so far. 

The first six games were made in Japan. The last four were also released in the United States. A few of the games were also released for the Virtual Console on Wii


Marth and Roy were special (unlockable) characters in the Super Smash Bros. Melee roster. Marth returned to Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Ike was added instead of Roy returning.

BioShock

BioShock is a first person shooter/Horror video game made by 2K Games for the Xbox 360, Windows, and PlayStation 3 game consoles. It got very good reviews and sold very well. The game's story is about a man who is in a plane crash in the Pacific Ocean and finds a lighthouse in the middle of the sea, which takes him to an underwater city created by a man named Andrew Ryan called Rapture, which is home to many violent creatures called Splicers. 

"BioShock" is set during 1960, in Rapture, a fictional underwater city. The player learns about Rapture by listening to voice recordings. Rapture was created by a man called Andrew Ryan, who did not like cruel political, economic, and religious power over land. The city was secretly built in 1946 on a mid-Atlantic seabed, using submarine volcanoes to give geothermal power. Scientific progress grew in Rapture, leading to fast developments in engineering and biotechnology thanks in part to the brilliant scientists that Ryan brought to the city. Scientists also made ADAM, stem cells harvested from an unknown species of sea slug, which were discovered by Dr. Bridgette Tenenbaum to have the ability to heal damaged tissue and rewrite the human genome. Tenenbaum joined with businessman and mobster Frank Fontaine to create the plasmid industry, which offered superhuman physical enhancements to its customers. Tenenbaum found that ADAM could be mass-produced by implanting the slugs in the stomachs of young girls ("Little Sisters"), taken from orphanages founded by Fontaine.

As time passed, the gap between rich and poor increased. Frank Fontaine created charity organizations to support the underclass. His goal was to use his charity organizations to manipulate the poor. He also made a smuggling operation to supply citizens with forbidden items from the surface, such as religious material. These, along with his control of the plasmid industry, made him immensely powerful. He tried to overthrow Ryan, but the revolt was violently crushed and Fontaine was said to be dead. Ryan seized control of Fontaine's plasmid business. Within a few months, a new figure named Atlas rose as the leader of the disgruntled lower class. On New Year's Eve of 1959, Atlas and his ADAM-infused followers began a new revolt against Ryan that spread throughout Rapture. Ryan in turn began splicing his own forces, and his paranoia had reached such a level he was hanging dozens of people, mostly innocent, in Rapture's main square. In order to solve ADAM shortages, the Little Sisters were mentally conditioned to wander the city and extract ADAM from the dead, recycling it into raw ADAM in their stomachs after swallowing it. "Big Daddies", enhanced and mentally sterilized humans in armored diving suits, were created by Dr. Suchong, the scientist behind many plasmids, to protect the Little Sisters in their work.
A drawback of ADAM is that a user must take regular infusions or suffer mental and physical problems. As the war hurt production and supply, every ADAM user in the city went violently insane. By the time the player arrives, only a handful of non-mutated humans survive in hideouts.

At the start of the game, player-character Jack is a passenger on a plane that goes down in the Atlantic Ocean in 1960, after ordered society in Rapture has collapsed. After surfacing, Jack finds himself the only survivor of the crash, and swims to a nearby lighthouse on an island, where he finds a bathysphere which he uses to sink into the ocean and enter the city of Rapture. An Irishman named Atlas uses the service radio found in the bathysphere to help Jack in making his way to safety. Meanwhile, Ryan, believing Jack to be an agent of a surface nation, uses Rapture's automated systems and his pheromone-controlled Splicers to try to kill Jack. Atlas tells Jack that the only way he can survive is to use the abilities granted by plasmids, and that he must kill the Little Sisters to extract their ADAM. Overhearing Atlas' words, Dr. Tenenbaum intercepts Jack, and urges him to save the Little Sisters instead, giving him a plasmid that will displace the embedded sea slugs in each Sister. Atlas says his wife and child have been hiding on a submarine and directs Jack towards it. Just as Jack and Atlas reach the bay where it is located, Ryan has it destroyed; an angry Atlas asks Jack to kill Ryan.

Eventually, after completing tasks like saving an artificial forest from dying and helping an insane artist build his sculpture, Jack confronts Ryan in his office, who is playing golf. Ryan reveals a truth that he has pieced together. He is Ryan's illegitimate son by an affair with Jasmine Jolene, a dancer. When Jolene became pregnant with Jack, she, in desperate need of money, had her embryo surgically removed and sold it to the highest bidder. She had not realized it was Frank Fontaine who purchased the son, leading to her death by an angry Ryan. Ryan further reveals that, after purchasing Jack's embryo, Fontaine made him to obey orders when he is told "Would you kindly..." Jack was then sent to the surface when the war started to put him beyond Ryan's reach. When the conflict between Fontaine and Ryan reached a stalemate, Jack was sent instructions to board a flight with a package and to use its contents, a revolver, to hijack and crash the plane near the lighthouse, enabling him to return to Rapture as a tool of Fontaine. Because Jack was Ryan's son, he could freely use Rapture's bathysphere network, which had been locked out to everyone except those within Ryan's "genetic ballpark". Finally, Ryan has Jack kill him, wanting to die on his own terms. With Ryan's death, Jack realizes too late that Atlas has also been using the trigger phrase to control him. Atlas reveals himself as Fontaine, who faked his death to throw Ryan off his trail and take control of the city, leaving Jack at the mercy of the reactivated security systems. Dr. Tenenbaum and her Little Sisters help Jack escape through the vent system, where he falls and loses consciousness.

When Jack awakens, Dr. Tenenbaum has already turned off the trigger phrase. When it becomes clear to Fontaine that he is losing control of Jack, Fontaine points out the fact that Tenenbaum has survived both World War II as a Holocaust victim and the battle in Rapture, hinting that she has a secret agenda of her own. With the help of the Little Sisters, Jack is able to track down Fontaine. Fontaine, having been cornered, injects himself with huge amounts of ADAM and becomes an monster. Jack battles Fontaine, eventually beating and allowing the Little Sisters to take the ADAM from Fontaine, killing him.

Three endings are possible depending on how the player interacted with the Little Sisters, all narrated by Dr. Tenenbaum. If the player harvested "no" Little Sisters (thereby saving their lives), the ending shows five Little Sisters returning to the surface with Jack and living full lives under his care, including their graduating from college, getting married, and having children; it ends on a heart-warming tone, with an elderly Jack surrounded on his deathbed by all five of the adult Little Sisters.

If the player harvested (and thereby killed) "all" or almost all of the Little Sisters, the game ends with Jack turning on the Sisters after defeating Fontaine, presumably killing them all and taking their ADAM. Tenenbaum narrates what occurred, angry Jack and his actions, voice thick with anger. Later in the second ending, a "George Washington"-class submarine carrying nuclear missiles comes across the wreckage of the plane and is suddenly surrounded by bathyspheres containing Splicers. The Splicers kill all hands aboard the submarine and take control of it.

If the player killed more than one Little Sister, but not enough to obtain the previous ending, the ending is the same to the second one, but the tone of Tenenbaum's voice is a sad one, as opposed to angry and there are minor dialogue changes.

<doc id="121619" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121619" title="Dilemma">
Dilemma

A dilemma (Greek δί-λημμα "double proposition") is a problem with at least two solutions or possibilities. None of the solutions are practically acceptable; one in this position has been traditionally described as being impaled on the horns of a dilemma, neither horn being comfortable.

The dilemma is sometimes used as a rhetorical device, in the form "you must accept either A, or B"; here A and B would be propositions each leading to some further conclusion. Applied in this way, it may be a fallacy, a false dichotomy.

In formal logic, the definition of a dilemma differs markedly from everyday usage. Two options are still present, but choosing between them is immaterial because they both imply the same conclusion. Symbolically expressed thus:

formula_1

This can be translated informally as "one (or both) of A or B is known to be true, but they both imply C, so regardless of the truth values of A and B we can conclude C."

Horned dilemmas can present more than two choices. The number of choices of Horned dilemmas can be used in their alternative names, such as two-pronged (two-horned) or dilemma proper , or three-pronged (three-horned) or trilemma, and so on.

Constructive dilemmas--

Destructive dilemmas--

In "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," Robert Pirsig outlines possible responses to a dilemma. The classical responses are to either choose one of the two horns and refute the other or alternatively to refute both horns by showing that there are additional choices. Pirsig then mentions three illogical or rhetorical responses. One can "throw sand in the bull's eyes" by, for example, questioning the competence of the questioner. One can "sing the bull to sleep" by, for example, stating that the answer to the question is beyond one's own humble powers and asking the questioner for help. Finally one can "refuse to enter the arena" by, for example, stating that the question is unanswerable.

To simple sight it is a combination of techniques of taekwondo with others of aikibudo. Its teaching is very much focused to the self-defence. 

The history of hapkido is enough confused, but many resources believe it to be the work of two Koreans: Choi Yong Sul (1904-1986) and Ji Han Jae (1936-). When was child, Choi had been in Japan, where it seems that he worked as servant for the master of Daito ryu Aiki jutsu, Sokaku Takeda. 

Choi had demonstrated qualities in Daito-ryu Aiki-jutsu and often in Takeda they sent him in order to face with other persons who performed martial arts. From his return to Korea, Choi had begun to give classes of martial arts. One of his students, Ji Han Jae, had made Korean traditional techniques of kicks and punches (obtained from taekkyon and from hwarangdo) a part of the collection of techniques and in result he gave it the name of hapkido in the 1959. 

Besides of Choi and Ji, many schools of Korean martial arts have taken part in the development of several techniques that have helped in causing such hapkido as it is known it.

Royal Society

The Royal Society is a society for science and scientists. It was founded in 1660 by Charles II. It is the oldest society of its kind still in existence.

A Royal Charter, on 15 July 1662, created "The Royal Society of London".

Lord Brouncker was the first President, and Robert Hooke was Curator of Experiments. The reigning monarch has always been the patron of the Royal Society since its foundation.

The motto of the Royal Society is "Nullius in Verba" (Latin: = Nothing in words). This shows the Society's commitment to establishing scientific truth through experiment rather than by quoting authority. 

Although this seems obvious today, the philosophical basis of the Royal Society differed from previous philosophies such as scholasticism, which established scientific truth based on deductive logic, concordance with divine providence and the citation of such ancient authorities as Aristotle.

The members of the society are called Fellows of the Royal Society, and put the letters FRS after their names. The are elected by existing Fellows. All other posts, such as the Secretary and President, are also by election. 


The Society's 15 Sections are administered by the permanent staff, led by the Executive Secretary, Stephen Cox CVO. The Executive Secretary is supported by the Senior Managers of the Society, including:

The Society bestows ten medals, seven awards (prizes) and nine prize lectureships variously annually, biennially or triennially, according to the terms of reference for each award. The Society also runs The Aventis Prizes for Science Books.

Hercules: The Legendary Journeys

Hercules: The Legendary Journeys is an American cult television series. It aired from January 16 1995 until November 22 1999. The series was created in 1995 by writer-producers Christian Willians under his production tag, "Pacific Renaissance Pictures LTD" with later co-executive producers being Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert, John Schulian and R. J. Stewart, the series is a Spin-off from the TV movies series aired in 1994, "Hercules and the Amazon Women", "Hercules and the Lost Kingdom", "Hercules and the Circle of Fire", "Hercules in the Underworld", and "Hercules in the Maze of the Minotaur", the last of which served mostly as a "clip show" of the previous movies as a lead up to the series, was very loosely based on the tales of the classical Greek culture hero Hercules. It ran for six seasons, producing action figures and other memorabilia as it became one of the highest rated syndicated shows in television history.

The series is set in a fantasy version of ancient Greece not precisely located in historical time. Although set in ancient Greece, the show also has a mixture of Oriental, Egyptian and Medieval elements in various episodes. The show stars Kevin Sorbo as Hercules and regularly features Michael Hurst as his sidekick Iolaus. Robert Trebor often rotates with Iolaus as Hercules' other sidekick, Salmoneus. 

Typical plot lines involve Hercules and Iolaus, or Salmoneus, saving rustic villagers from monsters, evil warlords or the often selfish whims of the gods. In the earlier episodes, as mentioned in the show's opening title, Hercules' main nemesis is his evil stepmother Hera, who seeks to destroy Hercules using various monsters, because he is a reminder of her husband Zeus' infidelity. As the series progressed, a wider range of enemies was used; notably, the malicious Ares, god of war, replaced Hera as the show's primary antagonist. Towards the end of the series Ares is himself replaced by the evil god, Dahak, who is the main villain in the show's fifth season and sets off a story arc that has Hercules traveling to Sumeria, Norseland and Éire. Although Zeus, Hercules' father, is frequently cited by Hercules as a neglectful father, Zeus' love for Hercules is well-documented in the show. Indeed, Hercules is often referred to as "the favorite son of Zeus". Zeus makes several appearances on the show, even saving his son's life and restoring his superhuman strength on one occasion when he needs it the most. Hercules, for his own part, is always there for Zeus when his father needs him, and in the end, Hercules reconciles with his father and buries whatever issues he has with the father he has come to understand and love. 

The show had a successful spin-off, "", with which it shared recurring characters such as Ares, Autolycus, aforementioned Salmoneus, Aphrodite and Callisto. Both shows, although produced in New Zealand using mostly local actors who strove for American accents, were syndicated worldwide. 





"Anchor Bay Entertainment" has released all 6 seasons of "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" as well as all TV-Movies on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time. The first two season box sets are not closed-captioned, even though the original release of episodes on TV was.

Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album

The Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album is an award given to recording artists for quality albums in the alternative rock genre at the Grammy Awards. The Grammy Awards were established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony each year by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position".

The definition of "alternative" has been debated. The award was first presented in 1991 to recognize non-mainstream rock albums "heavily played on college radio stations". According to the Academy, the award is presented to "vocal or instrumental alternative music albums containing at least 51% playing time of newly recorded music". The Academy defines "alternative" as a "non-traditional" genre that exists "outside of the mainstream music consciousness". In 1991, and from 1994 to 1999, the award was known as Best Alternative Music Performance. Beginning in 2001, award recipients included the producers, engineers, and/or mixers associated with the nominated work in addition to the recording artists.

As of 2011, Radiohead and The White Stripes share the record for the most wins in this category, having won three times each. Radiohead's lead singer, Thom Yorke, was also nominated for the 2007 award for his solo album. Beck and Coldplay have each received the award twice, the latter being the only group to win two years in a row. American artists have been presented with the award more than any other nationality, though it has been presented to musicians or groups from the United Kingdom five times, from Ireland twice, and from France once. Female musicians Tori Amos and Björk hold the record for the most nominations without a win, with five each.

 Each year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year.

Young Hercules

Young Hercules is a spin-off from "". It was aired on FOX Kids Network from September 12, 1998 to May 12, 1999. It lasted only one season with 50 episodes, and starred Ryan Gosling, replacing Ian Bohen from the pilot movie as the title character. Ian Bohen was offered the part, but opted not to spend an entire year in New Zealand where the series would shoot principal photography.

The show features the efforts of Ares, the god of war, played by Kevin Smith, who attempts often to destroy his younger half-brother to win over Zeus' good graces. Among his group is his nephew Strife (Joel Tobeck), who is the rather weaker member of the team. Strife's partner is Discord, goddess of retribution (Meighan Desmond), who acts more level-headed and power hungry than her counterpart on more than one occasion.

The storyline follows Hercules (Ryan Gosling) as he attends Cheiron's Academy to train in the arts of the warrior under the wise headmaster Cheiron the Centaur (Nathaniel Lees). He makes friends with the future king of Corinth, the prince Jason (Chris Conrad) and a thieving former member of a bandit group Iolaus (Dean O'Gorman) who was sentenced to the training academy as an alternative to prison for his crimes. Hercules also meets the academy's first female cadet, Lilith (Jodie Rimmer). Other characters of interest include Kora, the Inn Keeper, who unknown to Hercules and his friends, is a devotee of Artemis, Goddess of the Hunt. As the series develops, Kora is revealed to have special powers which allow her to do Artemis' bidding. There are hints of romance between Hercules and Kora, although their friendship keeps it all innocent. 

The overall plot of the show is to fill in any of the gaps that may exist between the version of "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" and the episodes that transpire from his young adult life, although very loosely due to its continuity errors by neglecting the "Young Hercules" movie and the flashback episodes of the fourth season of "Hercules".

Emmaus

Emmaus is a place in Palestine, where two people met Jesus after his Resurrection, according to the Gospel of Luke (Luke 24:13-16...28-31):
That very day two of them were going to a village (one hundred and) sixty stadia away from Jerusalem called Emmaus, and they were speaking about all the things that had occurred. And it happened that while they were speaking and debating, Jesus himself drew near and walked with them, but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him … As they approached the village to which they were going, he gave the impression that he was going on farther. But they urged him, ‘Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is declining.’ So he went in to stay with them. And it happened that, while he was with them at table, he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them. With that their eyes were opened and they recognized him.

According to a very ancient Christian tradition, Emmaus is today's Arab village of Amwas, which lies 160 stadia (30 km, 19 miles) to the West of Jerusalem. It can take 6 to 7 hours to come from Jerusalem to Emmaus on foot, if one walks across the mountains of Judea. The place was called Nicopolis during the 3d-7th centuries AD. During Byzantine times, two big Basilicas (churches) where built here with beautiful mosaics and a baptistry (a place for baptism).
Many manuscripts of the Gospel of Luke have a shorter distance between Jerusalem and Emmaus: 60 stadia (12 km, 7 miles). It is this distance which is found in modern printed Bibles. During the Crusader and Renaissance times many Christians, traveling to the Holy Land, were looking for Emmaus at the distance of 7 miles from Jerusalem. That's why several villages which lie 12 km away from Jerusalem were thought to be Emmaus. Even today one can find three Emmaus in the Holy Land: Emmaus Nicopolis, Qubeibe and Abu-Gosh!

<doc id="121792" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121792" title="Greek numerals">
Greek numerals

Greek numerals are a system of representing numbers using letters of the Greek alphabet. They are also known by the names "Milesian numerals", "Alexandrian numerals", or "alphabetic numerals". In modern Greece, they are still in use for ordinal numbers, and in much of the same way that Roman numerals are in the West; for ordinary (cardinal) numbers, Arabic numerals are used.

At first, before it was used more, the Greek alphabet, Linear A and Linear B had used a different system with symbols for 1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10000 operating with the following formula: | = 1, – = 10, ◦ = 100, ¤ = 1000, ☼ = 10000.

The earliest alphabet-related system of numerals used with the Greek letters was a set of the acrophonic Attic numerals, operating much like Roman numerals (which derived from this scheme), with the following formula: Ι = 1, Π = 5, Δ = 10, ΠΔ = 50, Η = 100, ΠΗ = 500, Χ = 1000, ΠΧ = 5000, Μ = 10000 and ΠΜ = 50000. 

The acrophonic system was replaced by a new alphabetic system, sometimes called the Ionic numeral system, from the 4th century BC. Each unit (1, 2, …, 9) was assigned a separate letter, each tens (10, 20, …, 90) a separate letter, and each hundreds (100, 200, …, 900) a separate letter. This requires 27 letters, so the 24-letter Greek alphabet was extended by using three obsolete letters: fau ϝ, (also used are stigma ϛ or, in modern Greek, στ) for 6, qoppa ϟ for 90, and sampi ϡ for 900.. To distinguish numerals from letters they are followed by the "keraia" (Greek "—insect antenna"), a symbol similar to an acute sign (Unicode U+0374). 

This alphabetic system operates on the additive principle in which the numeric values of the letters are added together to form the total. For example, 241 is represented as σμαʹ (200 + 40 + 1).

To represent numbers from 1,000 to 999,999 the same letters are reused to serve as thousands, tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands. A "left keraia" (Unicode U+0375, ‘Greek Lower Numeral Sign’) is put in front of thousands to distinguish them from the standard use. For example, 2008 is represented as ͵βηʹ (2000 + 8).

In modern Greek, uppercase letters are used more, as in Φίλιππος Βʹ = Philip II.

The Greeks also used the myriad to denote 10,000 (Μʹ) and the myriad myriad for one hundred million (ΜΜʹ).

Hebrew numerals

The system of Hebrew numerals is a quasi-decimal alphabetic numeral system using the letters of the Hebrew alphabet.

In this system, zero does not have a place, and the number values for each letter are added together. Each unit (1, 2, ..., 9) is assigned a separate letter, each tens (10, 20, ..., 90) a separate letter, and each hundreds (100, 200, ..., 900) a separate letter.

Hebrew has masculine and feminine ways of saying the words. For just counting, feminine is used. Otherwise, the gender is used (ex. two boys, two girls).

Hercules and the Amazon Women

Hercules and the Amazon Women is a 1994 television movie starring Kevin Sorbo and Michael Hurst. This movie is loosely based on the labor of Hercules to get the Golden Girdle. Here instead of getting the Golden Girdle, he faces the Amazon women who are plaguing the men in their area. Hippolyte like in the Marvel comics and mythology falls in love with Hercules. But unlike in the myth, Hippolyte befriends Hercules.

Three men are walking through the woods, they hear strange noises and catch glimpses of something moving in the undergrowth. Suddenly they are attacked by unseen creatures. Two men are killed, but one escapes and flees the woods.

Hercules strolls into a village after returning from one of his adventures, and is greeted by Iolaus. It is established that Iolaus is getting married and that Hercules is the best man. The two men set off for Alcmene's house. While walking through the woods, they reminisce that it has been a long time since they last saw each other. Iolaus tells Hercules about his bride-to-be, Ania. They stumble upon a little girl crying alone near an altar. She tells them that a monster killed her father while they were placing an offering to the goddess. Hercules tries to comfort the girl and asks if he can help, but the girl transforms into a monster. Hercules chops off its head, thinking it is now dead, Hercules and Iolaus begin walking away. They hear a noise and turn around to see that the monster is not dead, but has now grown two new heads in the place where the previous one was. The monster is a Hydra. Hercules tells Iolaus to grab the torch from the altar, Hercules cuts off the heads and burns the Hydra, preventing it from growing new heads, thus killing it. After the Hydra is destroyed a peacock feather remains in its place, Hercules tells Iolaus that Hera is responsible for the Hydra.

Hercules and Iolaus finally reach his mother's house, after a short chat with Alcmene, Iolaus invites them both for dinner, then leaves. Later on that evening while the four are enjoying dinner, Ania glimpses a man outside the window and Hercules goes to investigate. It is Pithus, the man who escaped the creatures at the beginning of the film. He explains to Hercules about his village being attacked by the creatures and Hercules agrees to help. Iolaus persuades Hercules to let him go along for one last adventure before he is married, Hercules reluctantly relents and says that he can come along. The three men set off for the village. When they arrive Hercules asks where all the women are, Pithus tells him that they were stolen by the creatures in the forest. Hercules and Iolaus head off to find the beast and rescue the village's women. In the forest they are ambushed by the beasts, they manage to stave off the attack for a time, but Iolaus discovers that the beasts are really women. After he chases after one he is fatally injured in the fight and Hercules is captured and taken to the City of Amazons.

Hercules is then seen being taken captive by the women. He has been stripped of his shirt and chained to a wooden sled assembled by the women that is attached to a horses saddle and being pulled along. The women have also cleave gagged his mouth with a black leather strap. He is surrounded by women on each side of him and led into a village full of women. He is starred at by many of the women. A few laugh and taunt him. You can hear one of the women saying "keep him bound" and another saying "Men should be seen and not heard" in reference to him being gagged. In vein Hercules muffles angry speech through the gag. Women continue to laugh at him. In the village, some women are being trained in combat and others are doing chores. When he arrives at the end of the village, the leader of the Amazon army (Lysia) helps to release him from the sled. She tells Hercules "If you're looking for men, you won't find any. Not in the city of amazons. You're the only one and I don't think you'll last very long."

Hercules is taken by the women to the Queen, Hippolyta. She removes the gag from his mouth. She tells him that she knows he is here to defeat them and that Hercules has been beaten by women. Hercules tells her she is wrong. Using a magic candle, the Hippolyta turns Hercules into a baby telling him she will show him what he is really like. As Hercules reverts to infant form we are shown flashbacks to Hercules's youth and times when he has been told by people how to behave toward women. Later he returns to adult state, realising that Hippolyta is right and that his attitude toward women is wrong, he tells her that he can change. She says that he cannot change and that all men are the same. Hippolyta goes to consult with Hera, she tells Hippolyta to lead an attack on the village

Hercules escapes from the Amazons and warns the men of the village of the forthcoming attack. He prepares them for when the women arrive. The women ride into the village and order the men to remove their clothes, telling them they are here for only one thing. The men tell the women to sit and talk with them for a while. Pithus's wife enters her home, and her son Franco asks if she really is his mother. He tells her he often dreams about her but she has no face, she removes her mask and shows her face to Franco. Hercules stands up to Hippolyta, who says she's not afraid of Hercules. He kisses her, she tells him she's not afraid and kisses him back. The two make love. The following day the women are still with the men. The Amazons return to their city and both men and women reminisce about the night before. Hera tells Hippolyta that Hercules has tricked her and to attack the village again, this time killing all the men and boys. Hippolyta refuses but Hera possesses her. Hera, now in control of Hippolyta's action orders the women to attack the village.

Hercules stops Hippolyta and realises that she is possessed by Hera. She rides off and Hercules goes after her. As they fight Hercules tries to get through to Hippolyta, telling her that she is stronger than Hera. Hercules best her and is about to deal the fatal blow, but cannot because it is Hippolyta's body and not really Hera. Hercules leaves and Hera follows him, goading him. He tells Hera that if he or Hippolyta have to die then he will give up his life for her, saying he could not live his life without her. Upon hearing this Hera runs Hippolyta's body over the edge of a waterfall, killing her.

Hercules returns to the City of Amazons, and retrieves the candle Hippolyta used to send him back to his childhood. Zeus appears and tells him the candle does not work in the way Hercules wants it to. Hercules replies that Zeus could make it work that way. Zeus tells Hercules that if he did that he would be in big trouble with Hera, but Hercules persuades him anyway. Zeus blows out the candle and Hercules is taken back to the night of the dinner. Ania see Pithus outside the window and Hercules goes to tell him that the village does not need the help of Hercules. He explains that all the men need to do is treat the women with respect and things will sort themselves out. Pithus returns to the village and when the women come the men sort out the problems that have been occurring. Alcmene asks Hercules if there is a woman out there who will make him happy like Ania did for Iolaus, Hercules replies that he is sure there is.

Eventually, Hercules leads her to a camp of refugees from the city, which has been taken over by Hera's Blue Monks. Hercules helps the refugees take back the city.

Three men are running along the riverside. One of them stops to take a drink from the river. As he stoops down to quench his thirst a female figure composed of water rises out of the river and pulls him under, drowning him. The other two men run on. While running, one man is hit by a boulder and killed. The remaining man escapes. Elsewhere a young woman is collecting water, when the ground begins to shake. She flees back to the village to warn them that a giant is coming. The giant follows the woman to the village and rips the roof of the tavern. Hercules presents himself to the giant and the giant challenges Hercules to a fight. Hercules goes outside and he beats the giant. As the village celebrates the defeat the man from earlier in the film arrives in the village. He asks for Hercules' help. He explains to Hercules that his people have been driven from their city, the lost city of Troy.

Zeus appears and Hercules asks him if he will help him. He asks his father how to find Troy and he says that Hera made it vanish. To find it, Hercules must find the one true compass which will point the way to Troy. Hercules heads off to find the compass. He finds a tribe of men preparing to sacrifice a young virgin to their water god. Hercules saves her from being sacrificed, while unknowingly being watched by a mysterious robed figure. The woman tells Hercules that her name is Deianeira. Later in the evening as they camp for the night, Deianeira tells her a story that she is the daughter of a king. She sees the dark figure and asks who he is and why she is being followed, but the figure does not answer. Later Hercules and Deianeira arrive at the slave market looking for Queen Omphale, the last person to have possessed the compass. In order to get to see the queen, Hercules sells himself as a slave, and the queen buys him. After spending the night with the queen, Hercules gets the compass and he and Deianeira continue searching for Troy. Deianeira gets attacked by some men but the figure in the dark robe saves her and tells her to follow her destiny.

Hercules and Deianeira head on to Troy. They arrive at the ocean and the figure standing on the cliffs summons a sea serpent to do Hera's bidding. It swallows Hercules and Deianeira. Hercules kills the monster from inside and they are washed up on the shore. Deianeira sees Troy in the distance and tells Hercules that she now remembers and this is where she is from. Deianeira and Hercules get caught in a trap and taken to the king. The king is ill and he and his daughter are reunited. He tells her that the Cult of the Blue Priests have taken over the city and the people have taken refuge in the woods. He tells Deianeira to rule them well, and then dies.

Hercules tutors the people of Troy and prepares them to battle to take back Troy. Deianeira realises that the people can not beat the Cult of the Blue Priests and goes looking for the Blue Priest. The people notice that Deianeira is missing and Hercules and the people use an underground tunnel to get into the city. As the people fight the cult members Hercules goes looking for Deianeira. He finds her about to be sacrificed to Hera and saves her. The Blue Priest and Hercules fight and Hercules cuts off the priest's head. A huge storm approaches, and Zeus tells Hercules that Hera is coming for Deianeira. Hercules saves her and Hera takes Hercules instead. As Deianeira is crowned Queen of Troy we see Hercules thrown down from out of the sky. A man approaches him asking him for help. Hercules agrees and the two men walk off to the next adventure.

Treasure Island

Treasure Island is an 1883 novel written by Robert Louis Stevenson.

Set in the days of sail ships and pirates,Treasure Island tells of the adventures of Jim Hawkins and his search for the buried treasure of the well known pirate Captain Flint.

The story is told by Jim himself and begins at his parent's inn 'The Admiral Benbow'. A mysterious stranger called Billy Bones rents a room at the inn. Billy lives in fear of a 'one legged man' and continually warns Jim to keep a look out for him. One day, he is visited by a fearful blind beggar called 'Blind Pew' who gives him the 'black spot' - the mark of imminent death among pirate crews. After Blind Pew leaves Billy collapses and dies of 'thundering apoplexy'.

Jim finds a map in Billy's sea chest just before Blind Pew returns with a band of evil pirates. Jim and his mother only just have time to hide before the pirates start to ransack the Inn looking for the map. Suddenly soldiers arrive and the pirates escape except for Blind Pew who is accidently trampled to death by the soldiers' horses.

Jim takes the map to Squire Trelawney and Doctor Livesey who realize that it is a treasure map showing where Captain Flint - an evil and infamous dead pirate - buried his ill gotten gains. The Squire and the Doctor decide to go and find the treasure and invite Jim to come along. In a few weeks the Squire has bought a ship called the 'Hispaniola' and has hired a good crew lead by the admirable Captain Smollet. The cook is a one legged man called Long John Silver whom everyone likes.

The ship sets sail and Captain Smollet immediately begins to have doubts about the trustworthiness of this crew - but no trouble develops. However, the night before they reach Treasure Island Jim over hears Silver and other members of the crew plotting to kill them all. He realises that Silver and most of the crew are actually pirates and were once members of Captain Flint's crew.

Jim warns the Doctor, Squire and the Captain about the evil plans that are afoot. The Captain sends most of the pirates ashore as a reward for arriving at the Island. Jim decides at the last moment to go ashore with them and once ashore hides in the woods that cover the Island.

Whilst hiding he comes across Ben Gunn - an ex-pirate who was marooned on the island three years ago by his crew mates. Ben has renounced piracy and promises to help Jim and his friends. Meanwhile the Captain and the others have abandoned the Hispaniola and taken refuge in an old stockade on the Island.

The pirates quickly realise that their plans have been discovered and attack the Captain and the others in an attempt to get the treasure map - however, for the time being the Captain and co. are safe in the stockade.

Jim splits manages to sneak into the stockade and is reunited with his friends. They spend an uneasy night in the stockade and the next morning Silver approaches waving a flag of truce. Silver offers them their lives in exchange for the treasure map, the Captain refuses and soon another gunfight starts. The stockade is attacked by the pirates but are fought off, though there are men killed on both sides. Captain Smollett is also injured.

Jim decides to escape from the stockade and sneaks off without telling the others. He finds a boat that Ben Gunn had told him he had hidden and then sails out to the Hispaniola and cuts its mooring ropes. He falls asleep in the boat exhausted.

In the morning, he only just manages to escape from drowning as the sea has become very rough. Luckily he spots the drifting Hispaniola and manages to board her. There are only two pirates on board and one of whom has been killed in a drunken brawl by the other. After a terrifying fight Jim kills the last pirate and manages to steer the ship in a small cove. He then heads back to the stockade to rejoin his friends.

The stockade is now in the hands of Silver and his mates. Jim is captured and is given the choice to join them. When he refuses the pirates want to kill him but Silver talks them out of it. Silver tells Jim that the Doctor has given him and map and also abandoned the stockade in exchange for being allowed to go free.

Silver tells Jim that he is now on the side of the Doctor. At this point the pirates attempt to give Silver the black spot but withdraw it when he reveals that he has the map. They agree to go and find the treasure the next day.

The treasure hunt begins and Jim is dragged along. The weather is hot and sweaty and the pirates are edgy. When they finally reach the spot where the treasure should be hidden they discover only an empty chest - the treasure has gone!

Silver immediately realises that there will be trouble and gives Jim a pistol with which to defend himself. The pirates turn angrily on Silver and are just about to attack him when there is a shot from the woods which kills one of them. The Doctor and Ben Gunn then appear from among the trees and the remaining pirates run off, heading for the remaining long boat left from the Hispaniola.

Jim and his friends easily get there before them and demolish the boat. At this point Ben Gunn reveals that he dug up the treasure several years ago and it is now in his cave.

Jim now takes everyone to the Hispaniola and they transport the treasure from Ben's cave to her hold. Silver still claims to be on the Doctor's side and helps them at every opportunity. Finally they set sail and leave Treasure Island and the last couple of pirates behind. They first sail the Hispaniola to America to get more crewman and moor there for one night.

In the morning, they discover that Silver and some of the treasure has disappeared. Finally they return home, the Captain makes a full recovery, Ben Gunn becomes a respectable citizen and Jim swears never to go chasing treasure again. No one ever hears of Long John Silver again.

Hercules and the Circle of Fire

Hercules and the Circle of Fire is a made for television movie. It was the third of five pre-series movies, so it may be considered part of the TV series "". When all the earth's fire begins to go out, Hercules and Deianeira must go in search for fire to stop the world from cold.

Hercules is walking through a snowy mountain top where he finds a woman in the cold, and goes to help her. He sees Zeus in a cave and a rock closes over the entrance. Hercules turns around and the woman calls out to him and freezes and explodes. Hercules wakes from a dream. He turns over and goes back to sleep. As he sleeps his camp-fire goes out. Next day Hercules and young man are walking through a cave with dead bodies strewn all over. The man tells Hercules that they are all men from his village and that the witch who guards the Fountain of Youth killed them for their youth and strength. At the heart of the cave they find an old woman, Hercules sees she is chained up, and is hit over the head by the man, who is really a warlock. He says to Hercules that he will now have Hercules' strength. Hercules and the warlock fight and he appears invincible, but then Hercules notices a beating heart among the items in the warlock's cave. Hercules rips the shirt of the warlock and sees that the heart belongs to the warlock. Hercules takes a knife and plunges it into the heart and kills the warlock. With the warlock now dead, the old woman reverts to her true form, that of a young woman. Hercules frees the woman from her chains and takes some water from the fountain. After this the fountain begins to boil and begins dissolving everything in the cave. Hercules grabs the woman and they leave the cave. Outside the cave Zeus appears and Hercules tells Zeus the water will cure Chiron of his wound.

Later Hercules arrives at Chiron's house. Hercules gives him the water and he drinks it. The wound heals, but after a few seconds the wound worsens. Hercules tells him he will find a cure for his wound. Meanwhile all over the village fires are being inexplicably extinguished. Hercules and Chiron are talking by the fire side and the fire goes out. Hercules realizes that something is amiss. He decides to investigate. He approaches Hera's temple which still has fire. A woman is trying to persuade the priest of the temple to let them light their torches. The priest refuses. Hercules kicks down the door, and Hera's priests fight him. He beats them, and lights the torch. Three women appear and tell Hercules that the torch is of no use, because Hera has stolen the Eternal Torch and plans to kill mankind once and for all. Hercules knows that humans cannot survive without fire, and if he does not get the Torch back all life will die. Later on the woman from the temple comes to Chiron. It is revealed she is Deianeira. Chiron says only Hercules can help her and points her to the man from the temple. Hercules says they need to talk to Prometheus, so he and Deianeira set off. They find Prometheus frozen. He says that Hera has stolen the Eternal Torch and that Hercules must get it back. Hercules and Deianeira travel onto Mount Aepion, where Hera has the Torch. While travelling Hercules is attacked by a giant named Antaeus, and with the help of Deianeira manages to kill him.

As they camp for the night, Hercules reveals to Deianeira that he was the one who accidentally inflicted Chiron's wound. The next day as they are crossing a gorge they arrive at a point where Hera has removed the bridge. Hercules says they can continue if they use the rope which still remains. Deianeira reluctantly agrees. The two finally arrive at Mount Aepion. Hercules walks through the snowy mountain top, just as in his dream. He finds Zeus and Hercules asks him what Hera has done. Zeus says that Hera has put the Torch in the centre of a ring of fire, and the fire has the power to kill immortals. Zeus warns Hercules from going through with his plan to get the Torch back. Hercules says he will do it anyway. The two men battle it out and Zeus tells Hercules that he is trying to save him. Hercules asks his father if he cares about humanity. Zeus replies that he does, but he loves Hercules more. Hercules tells Zeus he loves him too. Zeus accepts what Hercules must do, and lets him go. Hercules goes through the fire and retrieves the Torch. He throws it and it lands in Prometheus's home, waking him. Fire begins to return. As Hercules lays dying in the circle, Zeus begs Hera not to harm Hercules or he will haunt her for eternity. Seeing Hera will not spare Hercules, Zeus strides towards the ring of fire, saying if she kills Hercules, she will have to take him as well. Suddenly, Hera stops the flames and permits Zeus to helps Hercules, who thanks him for saving his life. Before leaving the cage Hercules picks up a stick and makes a torch. Zeus asks if he knows the power of the flames. Hercules acknowledges that he does. Hercules takes the torch to Chiron's house and asks him to step inside a circle of straw. Chiron stands in the centre of the circle and Hercules lights the straw with the torch. Chiron drops to his knees and cries out. As the flames die out Chiron exclaims that his wound is healed. The flames had burned away his immortality and healed the wound.

Edna Parker

Edna Ruth Scott Parker (April 20, 1893 – November 26, 2008) was an American woman who was the oldest living documented person from the death of Yone Minagawa on August 13, 2007 until November 26, 2008.

Parker was born on a farm in Morgan County, Indiana. She got a teaching certificate at Franklin College, and was a teacher for a few years until she married Earl Parker, who was her next door neighbor. He died on February 23, 1939. They had two sons, Clifford and Earl Jr., both of whom died before her.

After Earl's death, Parker lived by herself on a farm on Blueridge Road. She stayed there until she was 100, when she moved in to live with one of her sons. On a winter night, she was alone while her son and his wife went to a basketball game. When they came back, they found her in the back yard, in poor health, in the snow, and could only be seen as she had been wearing a red sweater that she liked a lot. Her family feared that she would die, but her health got much better. After that, the family thought that she needed to move to a nursing home.

Parker lived at Heritage House Convalescent Center, a retirement home in Shelbyville, Indiana. She remained in good health and was still able to walk. In April 2007, at age 114, she met with 113-year-old Bertha Fry, who was at the time the second-oldest person living in Indiana and the fifth-oldest living person. This set the highest total age for a meeting of two people.

Parker reached the age of 115 on April 20, 2008. There were two birthday parties held, the first of which was public, and the second private. The public one was celebrated on April 18, 2008, and the private on April 20. At both parties, one hundred fifteen balloons of many colors floated in the air, because she liked to see balloons in the air. This was Parker's final year, as she lived until November 26 of that year at age 115 years, 220 days.

<doc id="121864" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121864" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">
Wikipedia:Consensus

Consensus is a way of talking and working together to make decisions. In Wikipedia, it is the main way we make decisions. Consensus can also mean a decision made in this way, for example "The consensus was to use the new picture instead of the old one." Other groups use consensus, but we at Wikipedia are writing an encyclopedia and have special way of doing it. 

Consensus is usually what happens when people work together on a wiki. In any wiki, like Wikipedia, anyone can change almost every page. Everyone else who reads the page can keep the changes or change them to something else. If someone says something about a change or changes it back, then everyone should talk about it. If nobody says anything about a change, it often means that everyone agrees. This idea is often called "silence means consent". This is only true if enough people see the change: a small change on a small page may not be seen by very many people at all. You should ask others (like on ) if you make a big change to an important page and nobody says anything about it.

Consensus about a page is made by the people who are working on that page. However, they cannot go against the consensus of the entire Simple English Wikipedia. We have worked together to write many about how this Wikipedia should be written. These rules can be changed by the community if the consensus changes, but many people must talk about it first.

Consensus is built through talking, editing, or both. Consensus can only work among editors who respect each other. This means thinking that others are working to make the encyclopedia better (). Building a consensus also means that everyone must try to be to try and reach a compromise that everyone can agree on.

To help build consensus, we sometimes use polls. That is when people put their names down to show what they believe. People who are new to Wikipedia may think that this is voting, but it is not. We do not add up the names to see what consensus is. This is because consensus is not just what most people say should happen. Polls are usually the start of a discussion, not the end. 

There are a few times when we do not make decisions by consensus. These are:

Some people may confuse consensus with other things. These are:

<doc id="121873" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121873" title="Savate">
Savate

Savate, also known as "boxe française" (French boxing) or French kickboxing, is a French martial art - a kind of "boxe pieds-poings" - which use the hands and the feet as weapons and includes elements of Western boxing, techniques of grappling and techniques of leg (only with the feet: neither knee, nor shin). The persons who perform savate are called "savateurs" or ""tireurs"" in case of the men, and "savateuses" in case of the women.

Savate carry its name from the French word for "old shoe" (heavy shoes that were used to use during the combats) and is now a combination of the French techniques of fighting from beginning of the century XIX. In that age, savate was a kind of fighting which was common in Paris and in the North of France. In the South, especially in the port of Marseilles, the seamen had developed other style known as "jeu marseillais" ("the game of Marseilles"), that has obtained a new name "chausson" ("slipper", that was the shoes that the seamen used). Differently, in that age in England (the place of birth of boxing and the rules of Queensberry), people treated kicking as non-fair in sport or as something what only the cowards used more.

The two persons who has been recorded in the history of changing of street combat into modern savate are Michel Casseux (also known as "le Pisseux") (1794-1869), and Charles Lecour (1808-1894). Casseux opened in 1825 the first building in order to perform and to help in the development of a version of "chausson" and savate with rules (refusing to allow the strikes with the head, attacks with the fingers to the eyes, etc). Anyhow, such sport still have been limited by its opinion of street combat. A student of Casseux, Charles Lecour had been exposed to the English art of boxing in the year 1830 and he had felt himself misfit, because he used his hands in order to hit the feet of the opponent and to drive them away in this way, instead of punching as in boxing. By that reason he trained himself in boxing during two years and in 1832 he combined boxing with "chausson" and savate in order to create such sport of "savate boxe française" as we know it today.

Probably the more outstanding recognition as soon as to the esteem of savate came in 1924 when had been included as sport of exhibition in the Olympic Games of Paris. In spite of its roots, savate is a sport relatively safe in order to learn. According to USA Savate , savate is in the lower places of injuries when is compared with the soccer, football, hockey, gymnastics, basketball, baseball and speed skating.

At present, savate is performed in all the world by interested people: from Australia to United States and from Finlandia to the United Kingdom. Many lands, as is case of United States has national federations very interested for helping in the development of this sport.

The modern savate gives three levels of competition: "assault", "precombat" and "combat". In assault, the competitors need to be concentrated on the technique during they are trying make contact; refrees punish with penatlties the usage of excessive force. Precombat permits fighting without thoughtlessness in the force always and when the fighters wear protection as helmets and shin protectors. Combat, the level more intensified, is similar to the precombat but the usage objects of protection is prohibited (except in case of the genital protectors and the protectors of the teeth).

Many martial arts have systems of judgment of level of the persons who perform them, as the colour of the belts in the karate. In the same way, savate uses different colours in the gloves in order to show the level of a fighter; although, on the contrary that disciplines as the judo or the capoeira, where the fighters obtain new belts in each promotion, every fighter can use the same pair of gloves in several promotions (for that the level is not corresponding directamente with the colour of the gloves that are used but with that is established in the licence). The beginners begin without colour and the different exams of promotion permit them to be promoted to blue, green, red, white and yellow in that order. The competition is restricted for the red gloves and higher; each federation has the possibility to establish the conditions as little as possible for teaching this sport. In France, it is necessary to have the yellow glove in order to being able to gain the degree of instructor ("moniteur") and the silver glove in his technical category in order to obtain the title of teacher ("professeur"). In other lands as Mexico, all technical degrees from the green require an evaluation on subjects of helping in teaching in order to being able to increase the development of that art.

Juan Diego Flórez

Juan Diego Flórez (born January 13, 1973 in Lima, Peru) is a Peruvian operatic tenor. He is famous for the roles he sings in bel canto operas.

Juan Diego Flórez was born in Lima, Peru on January 13, 1973. His father, Rubén Flórez, was a guitarist and singer of Peruvian popular music. His mother worked in a pub where music was performed live. When a musician was ill Juan would sing instead. It was good experience for him.

He entered the Conservatorio Nacional de Música in Lima at the age of 17. He was intending to have a career in popular music. His teacher Andrés Santa María found that he had a superb voice for classical music. He became a member of the Coro Nacional of Peru and sang as a soloist in Mozart's "Coronation Mass" and Rossini's "Petite Messe Solennelle".

He was given a scholarship to the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia where he studied from 1993 to 1996 and began singing in student opera productions. He sang roles in operas by Rossini, Bellini and Donizetti. During this period, he also studied with Marilyn Horne at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara. In 1994 the Peruvian tenor, Ernesto Palacio invited him to Italy to work on a recording of Vicente Martín y Soler's opera "Il Tutore Burlato". Palacio became Flórez's teacher and helped him an enormous amount in his career.

Flórez's first big breakthrough came in 1996, at the Rossini Festival in the Italian city of Pesaro, Rossini's birthplace. At the age of 23, he was asked to sing the leading tenor role in "Matilde di Shabran" when Bruce Ford became ill. He first sang at La Scala in the same year as the Chevalier danois in Gluck's "Armide". His Covent Garden debut followed in 1997 where he sang the role of Count Potoski in the world premiere of Donizetti's "Elisabetta". Debuts followed at the Vienna Staatsoper in 1999 as Count Almaviva in "Il barbiere di Siviglia" and at the New York Metropolitan Opera in 2002, again as Count Almaviva. On February 20 2007, the opening night of Donizetti's "La Fille du régiment" at La Scala, Flórez broke the theater's 74-year-old tradition of not having any encores when he repeated the aria "Ah! mes amis" with its nine high C's after the audience gave him an enormous ovation.

Flórez sing in concerts in Europe, North America, and South America. Amongst the many places in which he has given concerts and recitals are the Wigmore Hall in London, the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in Paris, Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall in New York, the Palau de la Música in Barcelona, the Teatro Segura in Lima, and the Mozarteum in Salzburg. As a change from the usual music he sings, he sang "You'll Never Walk Alone" from the Broadway musical "Carousel" at the Berlin Live 8 concert in 2005.

He was signed by Decca in 2001 and since then made 5 CDs for them. Nearly all his operatic roles have been broadcast on radio or television.

Flórez was married to German-born Julia Trappe in a private civil ceremony on April 23, 2007 in Vienna. They held a religious ceremony at the Basilica Cathedral in Lima on April 5, 2008. Some of Peru's most famous people went, including President Alan García and author Mario Vargas-Llosa.

Juan Diego Flórez has won many awards and distinction, including Peru's highest honour: the "Gran Cruz de la Orden del Sol del Perú". He has even appeared on a Peruvian stamp.

Cerium

Cerium is a chemical element with an atomic number of 58. This means that the nucleus of Cerium has 58 protons in it. The atomic mass of Cerium is 140.12. The Chemical symbol of Cerium is Ce and it is a member of the Lanthanide group.

Cerium is a grey, shiny or lustrous metal. At room temperature Cerium is a solid. It melts and becomes a liquid at 798C and boils and becomes a gas at 3424C. 0.0046% of the Earth's crust is Cerium which means that it is quite common - more common than Tin and Lead and nearly as common as zinc

Cerium was first found in Sweden in 1803 by Berzelius and Hisinger and Klaproth in Germany. Because it is very reactive, it was not purified until 1875 in Washington DC. Cerium was named after the asteroid or minor planet Ceres which was first seen two years earlier in 1801.

Cerium is not often used as a metal since it quickly reacts with the air and tarnishes. Its most common use is as the 'flint' in a lighter, because it easily produces a spark when it is struck with another metal. Cerium is sometimes used in alloys because it often makes the alloy more heat resistant. Cerium is also used in special glass, ceramics and self cleaning ovens.

Cerium reacts in two ways to produce Cerous compounds or salts and Ceric compounds. Cerous salts have an oxidation number of 3 and ceric salts have an oxidation of 4.

Cerium has a large number of isotopes. Four of them are found in nature instead of having to be made, 
Cerium-140 (88.5% of all Cerium) and Cerium-142 (11.1%) are the most common. The average of the weights of each isotope is what give Cerium its Atomic Mass of 140.12

Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Cassandra

"Ended: 7 August 2008"
Cassandra has been editing since late March, and has very close to 1000 edits. More than half of her edits are to articles, some of her best being . She also is very clueful in other areas of the project, such as on the admin noticeboard. She has of deleted edits, which shows she does a good job of tagging articles for quick-deletion. In all, she will make a great admin - I hope you can support her.

Co-nomination by (): I would like to present to the community for adminship, Cassandra. Cassandra has been a part of Simple English Wikipedia, for over 4 months I believe, and was gathered almost 1000 edits, with about 100 deleted edits, which I greatly think they are mostly QD taggings. Not too long ago, I offered to nominate Cassandra when she and I thought she was ready for adminship. Since (above) has offered a nomination, and Cassandra accepted it, I would be happy to nominate her now. 

Cassandra, in my honest opinion, is one of our best candidates for adminship. She is involved in articles related to films, video games, and books (at least of what I've seen), and has done great to improve that area. Cassandra shows a knowledge of our policies from what she has done in her general editing. She has done some vandalism cleaning up, QD tagging, article writing, and even article saving. The quick deletion saving and the QD tagging she has done shows she will know when and when not to use the deletion tool. Cassandra knows when and when not to revert a possible vandalism edit, which shows she will know when and when not to use the block tool. Cassandra is very good in debates and discussions from what I've seen at , , and sometimes even . Cassandra is a very civil person, and she always has a cool head. Just the right qualities for an administrator.

In the future as an administrator, I believe Cassandra will be a very knowledgeable administrator. She obviously knows our policies, so I can't see any instance when Cassandra will even think about misusing the tools. Cassandra can really help Simple English Wikipedia run smoothly with her knowledge and skills. She has done great things as a non-admin, and she was worked in some admininstrative areas, so Cassandra is just the right Wikipedian for the job as an administrator.

1812 Overture

The 1812 Overture was written by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky as Op. 49 (French: "Ouverture solennelle "L'Année 1812""; Russian: "Торжественная увертюра 1812 года", "Toržestvennaja uvertjura 1812 goda") to remember Russia's 1812 defence against Napoleon's advancing Grande Armée at the Battle of Borodino, during the French invasion of Russia. The Overture was first presented to the public in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow on August 20, 1882 (NS; the OS date was 8 August). The overture is best known for its climactic volley of cannon fire and ringing chimes. While this piece has no historical connection with United States history, it is often used at Fourth of July celebrations.

The 1812 Overture is written for an orchestra which uses following music instruments:





Sixteen cannon shots are written into the score of the Overture. The Overture begins with the plaintive Russian Orthodox "Troparion of the Holy Cross" ("God Preserve Thy People") played by eight cellos and four violas. The piece moves through a mixture of pastoral and militant themes. The Overture includes the Russian folk dance "At the Gate, at my Gate." At the turning point of the invasion – the Battle of Borodino – the score calls for five Russian cannon shots. A descending string passage represents the following retreat of the French forces, followed by victory bells and a triumphant repetition of "God Preserve Thy People" as Moscow burns to deny winter quarters to the French. A musical chase scene appears. Out of it, the anthem "God Save the Tsar!" appears. The overture uses counterpoint to reinforce the appearance of the leitmotif that represents the Russian forces throughout the song.

Although God Save The Tsar! was the Russian National Anthem in Tchaikovsky's time. It was not the anthem in 1812. There was no official Russian anthem until 1815.

There are several recordings of the overture in a transcription by American conductor Igor Buketoff. with the following changes and additions:

The Matrix Revolutions

The Matrix Revolutions is a 2003 movie that was written and directed by the Wachowski brothers. It is the sequel to "The Matrix Reloaded".

When Neo wakes up, he finds himself at a train station. He is there because, when he used his power to destroy the sentinels at the end of the second movie, he touched the source and did not come back all the way. He is stuck there. Meanwhile, his girlfriend Trinity, Morpheus, and Seraph enter a club to talk to the Merovingian, who controls a lot of the Matrix. A gun fight ends in a Mexican standoff with guns pointed towards everyone. The Merovingian agrees to let Neo go, and Trinity picks him up.

The city of Zion is preparing for war. They pool all of their resources into a dock area. They use Armored Personnel Units (APU) to fight back. However, there are too many machines, and they soon have to fall back to the temple.

Niobe on her ship attempts to return to Zion by going through an area that only a very skilled pilot can go through. However, Niobe makes a mistake and the machines come after them. During one part of the dock battle, the commander Milfune tries to repel the machines but is overwhelmed. He dies. He tells the Kid to take his APU and to open the dock doors. The Kid does so and the ship comes through, blows its EMP, and saves the dock for now.

Near the end of the movie, Neo wants to take a ship to talk directly to the machines. Niobe turns her ship, the Logos, over to him. Earlier, Bane (who is now Smith) had stabbed a crew member and hid away on the Logos. While on the ship, Bane fights Neo and burn his eyes out. However, Neo has the power and can still see and kills Bane. As Neo and Trinity approach, the machines attack. Trinity flies above the clouds to kill the machines, but it also destroys their engines, and they lose control and crash into the ground, killing Trinity.

Neo walks up to the head of the machines, whose name is Deus Ex Machina. He says that Smith has gotten out of control and that he is the only one that can stop him. He says that he wants peace, so the machines stop attacking Zion. Neo and Smith start fighting again. This time Neo cannot beat him like he did with Bane. At the end, he says, "It was inevitable" and allows Smith to touch him and acquire him. Smith is then destroyed, as his only purpose was to balance Neo, who is now gone.

Hercules in the Underworld

Hercules in the Underworld is the fourth made for TV movie in the series "". When villagers begin disappearing it is discovered that they had fallen through a crack in the earth which goes straight to Hades. Hercules once again comes to the rescue and faces one of his most difficult challenges, and must prove himself as a man as well as a god.

In the centre of a village the ground begins to open up and a strange green light emanates from within. Two drunken men see the light and walk over to take a closer look. As they approach a gaseous vapour begins pouring out of the fissure and in a flash of light the two men are charred with only their bones remaining. The next day in a village square a man challenges the villagers to fight Eryx the boxer. One man agrees but he is tricked when he is introduced to the real boxer, a towering brute of a man. He fights him and kills him, an old man from the village tells a youth to find Hercules. After a short while the boy returns with Hercules, who challenges Eryx. They begin to fight and it appears that Eryx is going to beat Hercules, but then Hercules finally ends the fight by killing Eryx. With the man dead the man who first made the challenge gives Hercules a peacock feather, Hera's symbol. He goes to Hera's temple and asks if they can call a truce, Hera defies Hercules, so he destroys her temple. Zeus appears and tells Hercules that he will only make things worse between him and Hera. When Hercules arrives home Deianeira tends to his wounds.

The following day Hercules is working in the smithy with Nessus, the Centaur. He watches the children playing outside when a woman, Iole, comes looking for him. She says she's from the village of Gryphon and that they need Hercules' help. Hercules agrees to help, but Deianeira tells the girl to rest first. During the night the Iole tells Deianeira that she thought she saw someone outside her window, Deianeria tells her no-one is there. Deianeira gets a lantern and goes outside, she finds Nessus in the smithy and he tells her that she cannot trust Hercules with Iole as she is a young woman, Hercules will not be able to resist. She defends him saying that Hercules would be faithful to her. In the morning Hercules, Iole and Nessus leave for Gryphon. Before leaving Iole gives Deianeira a necklace to thank her for looking after her the night before. Deianeira goes to the market where a woman tells her that the necklace is a sign that she has lost her husband and tells Deianeira about the necklace is given to women whose men are to be killed by Nurian maidens. Deianeira goes after Hercules to warns him and finds the three at the river bank. She tells Iole to leave, but Hercules says he already knew she was a Nurian maiden, but that he loves Deianeira, and would never be unfaithful to her. After reassuring Deianeira, Hercules and Iole continue to Gryphon, but Nessus begins to stir doubts in Deianeira's mind, and after she tries to get away he attacks her. She calls for Hercules, who shoot an arrow, which strikes Nessus in the back. As he lay dying he tells Deianeira that his blood is powerful and will prevent Hercules from being unfaithful. She gives the cape to Hercules and tells him to wear it if he gets cold.

Hercules and Iole continue onto Gryphon, when they arrive the people take him to the area where the hole has opened up in the ground. He walks through the village seeing fire and destructions and dead bodies strewn on the floor. He approaches the fissure and looks into it and see spirits coming out from deep within the Earth. Zeus appears and tells him that it is the Underworld. Hercules asks if he is mortal or not, Zeus tells him he is mortal, but tries to prevent Hercules from going down the hole. Hercules prepares to go into the hole and puts on the cape that Deianeria gave him. It begins to choke him and tries to kill him, he struggles free and throws the cape, which disappears leaving only a peacock feather. Hercules runs and jumps into the hole. As Hercules travels to the Underworld, a man arrives at Hercules' house and tells Deianeira that Hercules is dead. He explains about the cape trying to kill Hercules and them he jumped into the hole. Hercules arrives in the Underworld, where he meets Charon, who transports him across the River Styx. On the other side of the river Hercules finds Cerberus' collar, he enters a doorway and vanishes.

Meanwhile, Deianeira, distraught by the though that she caused her own husband's death goes to a cliff top, while standing there she sees a vision of Hercules and reaches out to him, as she reaches out she falls from the cliff to the rocks below.

Hercules in the Maze of the Minotaur

Hercules in the Maze of the Minotaur is the fifth made for television movie based on the series "". Hercules has given up his days of traveling. He has found a place to live and be with his family. When a far off village is in danger from an unseen monster, Hercules is goes to help save the village from the monster. The origin of the monster is a combination of the Greek myth and the myths of Tantalus and Lycaon.

In a forest, two men are looking for treasure. They follow their map and find a cave covered with bushes. The two men enter the cave. In the cave, they find a large wooden door. As they try to get through the door, a monster breaks through the door. It chases after them. One man is captured. The other runs as the monster tells him to bring Hercules. At this time, Hercules is working on his farm. He sees his sons fighting and tells them that they should not fight. They says that Hercules fights. Hercules tells them that he only fights when he has to and only to stop other people from being harmed. He tells about the time when he had to fight Eryx the boxer to stop him from killing anymore people. He asks the boys if they understand. They say they do. Later that evening, Hercules is working in the stable, Zeus appears and they talk. Hercules tells Zeus that there have been no monsters for a while, which is good as he has now living with Deianeira and the children. Zeus gives him a scale from a sea serpent. Hercules remembers the time when he and Deianeira were swallowed by a sea serpent while looking for the lost city of Troy. 

At night, the children ask their father to tell them a story. He tells them how when he and Deianeira first met. Hercules begins telling how the fire had gone from the Earth and that Deianeira's village needed fire. He told them how he got the fire back from Hera's temple. During the story, Hercules sees that the children are asleep. He and Deianeira go to bed. She asks him if he misses travelling and fighting monsters. He says that he does miss it. The next day, Hercules is working in the stables. He sees something move quickly past the door. He goes to look but sees nothing. As he walks back into the stable, a man jumps on him. Hercules turns to see it is Iolaus. They begin talking about their past. The two men go inside to get a drink. Iolaus tells Hercules that he met a man who taught him to fight better. When Hercules attacks Iolaus, the smaller man does well at first. After a short while Hercules still wins. Deianeira tells Iolaus that since Hercules gave up his adventures he has become sad. A man comes at the stable looking for Hercules. He tells him that he must help his village and that a monster has taken his brother. Hercules says he cannot go. The man says he has to because he is Hercules. Later that evening Deianeria asks him why he refused to help. He tells her that he said that he would stay and raise the children with her. She tells him that he should not try to stop being Hercules, not for her or the children. She tells him to go. The next day, he and Iolaus set off for Alturia. As they travel to Alturia, a young couple are looking for somewhere quiet. They find the cave and enter. While they are in the cave, the Minotaur comes and attacks them.

When Hercules and Iolaus get to Alturia, they ask a woman where the monster is. She tells Hercules that there is not any monster. Underneath the village, the Minotaur says that Hercules will pay. Zeus appears and tells the Minotaur that he still has not learned his lesson, he replies that he has been feeding on hate. Minotaur taunts Zeus because he was unable to kill the Minotaur. Hercules and Iolaus are in a tavern. They get into a fight with some men because they do not believe that he is really Hercules. Outside the tavern, two men are killed and Hercules goes to see what happened. He is found by the villagers. They think he killed the men and chase him and Iolaus. The man who had asked for Hercules's help comes and takes Hercules to the cave where his brother was captured. Zeus appears and tells Hercules what the monster is and why he wants Hercules. He asks Hercules to kill the Minotaur. In the centre of the cave, the Minotaur challenges Hercules. They begin fighting. As Hercules is about to kill the Minotaur, the creature tells him that he is really Hercules' brother. Hercules cannot kill him. The Minotaur then attacks Hercules and Hercules has to kill him. As the Minotaur dies, he changes to his human form and Zeus tells him that it did not have to end that way. Hercules helps Iolaus and the other people being held by the Minotaur. With the people of the village now safe and Iolaus freed, the two men go back home.

Marzahn

Marzahn is a locality within the borough Marzahn-Hellersdorf of Berlin. 

Marzahn became part of Greater Berlin in 1920, as a part of the Lichtenberg district. In 1979 the large housing estate of Marzahn was separated from Lichtenberg to become an East Berlin borough in its own right and in 1986 the new Hellersdorf district (including Kaulsdorf and Mahlsdorf) was split from it. Berlin's 2001 administrative reform led to the former boroughs of Marzahn and Hellersdorf fusing into a single new borough.

In the north the locality includes the neighbourhoods of "Bürknersfelde" and "Ahrensfelde", an overbuilt strip of land which once belonged to the Brandenburg municipality of Ahrensfelde and was incorporated into Berlin in 1990.

The historic village of Marzahn was first mentioned as "Morczane" in a 1300 deed by Margrave Albert III of Brandenburg-Salzwedel, when he granted the estates to the Friedland Cistercian abbey (in today's Neuhardenberg). After the Thirty Years' War it fell to Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg.

Marzahn was the site of a labour camp (today a water treatment plant), where Roma were interned from July 16, 1936 on, two weeks prior to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, away from visitor's eyes. As a part of the Nazi "Porajmos" extermination policy, up to 2000 inmates remained there until in 1943 they were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where most of them were gassed. In 1941 the large factory of the "Carl Hasse & Wrede" machine tool company (now Knorr-Bremse) was erected, where hundreds forced labourers were employed. The victims were buried at the nearby "Parkfriedhof", a memorial marks the site.

In 1987 Marzahn hosted the "Berliner Gartenschau" a horticulture show on the occasion of Berlin's 750th anniversary. The area today called "Erholungspark Marzahn" includes the "Gärten der Welt" (Gardens of the World) project showing a Chinese, Japanese, Balinese and Korean garden, labyrinths modelled on Hampton Court Palace and Chartres Cathedral as well as a garden of the Italian Renaissance.

Marzahn is served by the S-Bahn lines S7 and S75 at the stations "Springpfuhl", "Poelchaustraße", "Marzahn", "Raoul-Wallenberg-Straße", "Mehrower Allee" and "Ahrensfelde". Tramway connections to the inner city are provided by the "M6" and "M8" lines of the Berlin Straßenbahn.

Helicobacter pylori

Helicobacter pylori ("H. pylori") is a spiral shaped bacterium that lives in or on the lining of the stomach. It causes more than 90 percent of ulcers, which are sores in the lining of the stomach or the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). Before 1982, when this bacterium was discovered, doctors thought that spicy food, acid, stress and lifestyle caused most ulcers. Because doctors now know that most ulcers are caused by an "H. pylori" infection, they can be cured with the correct antibiotics.

"Heliobacter pylori" was first discovered by Australian scientists, Barry J. Marshall and J. Robin Warren. They won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2005 for their work.

Schöneberg

Schöneberg is a locality of Berlin. Until Berlin's 2001 administrative reform it was a separate borough including the locality of Friedenau. Together with the former borough of Tempelhof it is now part of the new borough of Tempelhof-Schöneberg.

The village was first documented in 1264 by Margrave Otto III of Brandenburg. In 1751 Bohemian weavers founded Neu-Schöneberg also known as Böhmisch-Schöneberg, along the current Hauptstraße.

During the Seven Years' War on 7 October 1760 Schöneberg and its village church were completely destroyed by a fire due to the joint attack on Berlin by Austrian and Russian troops.

Alt & Neu Schöneberg were combined as one entity in 1874 and received town privileges in 1898. In 1920 Schöneberg became a part of Greater Berlin. Its town hall Rathaus Schöneberg was completed in 1914. Subsequent to World War II it served as the city hall of West Berlin until 1991 when the administration of the reunited City of Berlin moved back to the Rotes Rathaus in Mitte.

The movie starts with the Sirens singing "Across The Sea of Time" which is about how Zeus took the cronus stone from the titans and had a fling with Alcmene and had a son named Hercules, who defeated a hydra at an early age and became a hero. As they finish, a giant sea serpent comes from the sea and Hercules is trying to kill it. He finally throws a giant rock in its mouth but it jumps on the shore and lands on top of Hercules. It cant live on land so it dies and Hercules climbs out of its nosteral. The villagers thank Herc and Iolaus climbs out of a restchair and joins Hercules, who gets a big fish as a gift from the villagers. Herc and Iolaus head to Thebes to see Alcmene but Iolaus is a little upset because Herc gets all the credit. However the two defeat several highway men and alls okay. Saytars are in a bar and stole gold from helples people thus Xena and Gabrielle show up to beat them up and take the money back. Ares shows up after Gabrielle throws wine at a saytar and be ats him up with her fighting stick. He tells Xena to stop Herc from going to Thebes because there's a trap set for him there. Xena wants Herc to go since there's trouble and he needs to help. She is mad because Ares never gives up and wants her. She and Gabrielle argue about his intentions a little but are not enemys or nothings. Theres No rift between them in this movie. 

Hercules is acting like a horse and pulling an old style plough at his mom's house. Iolaus is tired but they see Zeus come from the heavens in his chariot winged horses like Pegasus driving the chariot down. He takes Alcmene to Mt Olympus and Hercules's pissed. Iolaus thinks Alcmene went on her own since she put up no fight but Herc disagrees and pushes Iolaus against a wall in his anger. Hercules says sorry and the two head to rescue Alcmene. Zeus talks to Ares and wonders why he did not stop Hercules. He says he tried to get a mortal named Xena to do it and Zeus is mad because Ares keeps wanting Xena. Hera shows up, Hera is an old woman with a bad attitude face and nasty voice and attitude, and yells at Zeus about bringing Alcmene here. She leaves and somehow steals the cronus stone in the moment, the stone that keeps the titans in the underworld lava pits. Hera summons the titans out while Zeus checks on Alcmene, whos been shrunk and placed in a small Arabian doll house castle for safety from Hera. Aphrodite surfs down a mountain and makes Iolaus very happy and hugs her bro Hercules. She tells Herc that Heras mad and not to go to Mt Olympus for his own good but he decides to go and Iolaus stays behind to entertain the goddess of love but she leaves when an earthquake starts. But its a small boy who falls into the lava pits. Hercules holds the colliding ends together and Iolaus pulls up the boy making both heroes. The mother takes her son as Xena and Gabrielle, in a nearby town, battle 3 thugs who they beat easily and Xena must stop a rolling giant rock from destroying the fat thug. As she is successful, they show Hercules meeting the titan Porphyion. The leader titan says Herc can go free because he is not defending the gods. Zeus calls Artemis, Aphrodite, and Ares together to fight The Titans and they hope Hercules helps them. Xena and Gabrielle are helping wounded people and Artemis decides to get Xenas help and turns Gabrielle into a giant bird. Xena flys on Gabrielle to The Gods home while Herc climbs up. Artemis says she turned Gabrielle to get Xenas help and Xena said that all she had to do was ask for help from Xena. The titans come and fight. There four big titans-Poprhyrion, Tethys, Crius, and Mnemosyne. Hercules shows up and says hi to Xena but rescues Alcmene and leaves everyone to fight the titans. Hera turns the gods into animal after. Iolaus and Xena escape via bird Gabrielle to Alcmenes house. Everyone's upset because Herc did nothing to help Alcmene. The gods are all small animals until Zeus can get the stone back. Ares is a goat, Aphrodite is a cow, Artemis is a rabbit, and Zeus is a mouse. Herc finds out that Alcmene was sick and Zeus offered to make up for hardtimes by giving her immortality and taking her to live with him on Mt Olympus. Hercules is still mad at Zeus 

The titans sing a stupid song and its back to earth where Xena sings something and both her and Hercules makeup and agree to help the gods get there home and stone back. The Titans get the stone from Hera and turn her into a small doll and place her in the dollhouse. Alcmene by the way has been turned back intoa normal person. The heroes ride Gabrielle to the mountain and fight the Titans. Herc gets the stone and tears it apart and thus the underworld caverns open and the lava pits are displayed. Hercules and Xena flip the fat titan Crius into the lave and Iolaus gets the water and fire females titans to collide and dissolve into the fiery pits. Gabrielle scoops up Porphy-rion who grabbed Hercules. Hercules managed to reach Gabrielles back where Xena and Iolaus are sitting and Gabrielle the bird drops the titan into the cavern, catches a falling Hercules, and drops him off on the gods mountain in time to close the stone which locks the titans in there prison of lava. Zeus and Alcmene go back to Olympus and Zeus welcomes Hercules to visit. Herc than heads of with Iolaus, Gabrielle, and Xena to Corinth to return a bag of gold and seek another adventure.

The songs "Across the Sea of Time", "Titans Song", and "Xena's Song" were written by Michele Brourman and Amanda McBroom.

Xena: Warrior Princess is a "beat 'em up" video game that was released on the PlayStation in September 30, 1999, developed by "VU Games" and published by Electronic Arts, based on the .

Playing as the television series' title character, you must rescue your companion, Gabrielle, from a fate worse than death and fight the forces responsible for her capture in the first place. The game is played from a third-person perspective and revolves around slashing, jumping, and kicking your way through a series of 3D environments. Various button combinations produce special combo moves like those seen on the show, but since mashing the buttons alone appears to work well, you will not be inclined to learn the combinations. Xena can also use power-ups, which she will find along the way, as well as her trademark chakram. Once you throw the chakram, the perspective switches to that of the whirling circle, which you are able to aim, after a fashion. Once it hits something, it is propelled back. The downside to using it is that Xena is defenseless while the weapon is in the air, so you have got to use it wisely when you are under fire from archers perched up above or from multiple opponents on the ground. You use the chakram to flip switches, cut chains, and pick off opponents from a distance. These opponents sometimes become tougher targets because of the hostages they keep so near to them.

L'incoronazione di Poppea

L'incoronazione di Poppea ("The Coronation of Poppea") is an opera in three acts by Claudio Monteverdi. It was the last opera that Monteverdi composed. The libretto is by Giovanni Francesco Busenello. The first performance was in the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice in 1642.

Most operas in the early 17th century were about mythological stories or stories from the Christian religion. This story, however, is about something that happened in the history of ancient Rome. It is about the evil emperor Nero and how he married Poppea. The gods still play a part in the opera, especially Cupid.

Although the opera is called "The Coronation of Poppea" we do not actually see any coronation ceremony.

Monteverdi was an experienced composer when he wrote this and the opera has some of his best music. The orchestra is only a small group of instruments: strings, recorders, cornetts (an old kind of trumpet), percussion, harp, lutes and gambas. The music does not divide sharply between recitative (narrating music) and aria (set songs), but flows gently from one type to the other.

When listening to this opera it is important to remember that in the 17th century men often sang women’s parts and women sang men’s parts. A part such as Nero would have been sung by a castrato. Nowadays it can either be sung by a countertenor (a man) or a mezzo-soprano (a woman). There are scenes in this opera where the actors disguise themselves as the opposite sex. In the 17th century opera audiences did not find anything unusual about a man pretending to be a woman pretending to be a man or the other way round.

The duet between Nero and Poppea at the end of the opera may have been written by another composer. 

The goddesses Fortune and Virtue are having an argument. They are being nasty to one another, each one is saying that she is better and more powerful than the other. Cupid (the god of love) comes in and says that he is even greater than they are, and that he rules both of them. Fortune and Virtue do not dare to disagree with him.

Otho, who is Poppea’s lover, returns to his house and finds that the emperor Nero is in his house spending the night with Poppea. Nero’s guards have surrounded the house. Nero tells Poppea he has to go now, but that he loves her and will come back very soon. When he is gone, Arnalta, Poppea’s nurse, warns her that her affair with Nero will bring trouble. Octavia, Nero’s wife, is very sad that her husband is having an affair with someone else and hopes that the gods will punish him. Her nurse comforts her, saying that she ought to find herself a new lover to make Nero cross, but Octavia has too much honour to do such a thing. The philosopher Seneca tells her that she should just accept her fate. The page boy tells the philosopher he is stupid.

Nero tells Seneca that he is going to get rid of his wife and marry Poppea. Seneca warns Nero that the people will not like this, but Nero does not care. He is emperor and can do what he likes. Nero tells Poppea that he loves her so much that he wants to make her empress. Poppea says to Nero that Seneca believes that Nero is only powerful because he (Seneca) can guide him. Nero immediately believes her and says Seneca should be killed. Otho has been watching this scene. He goes to Poppea and tries to get her love back, but Poppea says she belongs to Nero now. Otho realizes that Poppea just wants power, and he knows that Nero will order him to be killed when he finds out that he used to be Poppea’s lover, so he decides he will have to kill Poppea.

Otho goes to Drusilla who is in love with him. He tells her that he loves her, but he quietly says that Poppea is still in his heart.

The god Mercury warns Seneca that he is going to die. Seneca is quite happy with the news, because it will mean that he will live with the gods in heaven. Liberto, a messenger (his name means “a freed slave”), comes to tell Seneca that Nero is going to have him killed. He is surprised when Seneca already knows. There is a short scene in which the Page with the Lady-in-Waiting. Nero, with his friend Lucan, sings in praise of Poppea.

Octavia tells Otho to disguise himself in woman’s clothes and to go and kill Poppea. She says that he will tell Nero bad things about him if he doesn’t. There is a comic scene between the Page and the Nurse. Drusilla lets Otho borrow her clothes to disguise himself. Poppea is in her garden being lulled to sleep by Arnalta. Cupid sings a song, promising to protect her. When Otho, disguised as Drusilla, comes to kill her, Cupid stops him. 

Drusilla is happy because her rival is going to die. The guards immediately arrest her thinking that she tried to kill Poppea (it was actually Otho in disguise). Drusilla realizes she was stupid to lend Otho her clothes. She tells Nero that she is guilty. Otho then speaks and tells Nero what happened. Nero punishes him by telling him to leave Rome and go and live in a faraway wilderness. Nero also sends Octavia away from Rome. He says she must be put in a boat and left to the mercy of the winds. Octavia sings a farewell song to Rome. Arnalta sings a comic song about how important he now is as the empress’s nurse. The opera finishes with a beautiful love duet for Nero and Poppea.

Fibonacci number

The Fibonacci numbers are a pattern of numbers in mathematics named after Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci. Fibonacci's 1202 book "Liber Abaci" introduced the pattern to Western European mathematics, although this pattern was already described in Indian mathematics.

The first number of the pattern is 0, the second number is 1, and each number after is equal to the two numbers before it added together. For example 0+1=1 and 3+5=8.

Fibonacci sequences appear in many places in nature. Some examples of the Fibonacci sequence being used in nature are tree branches, the pattern of leaves on a stem, the fruitlets of a pineapple, the flowering of artichoke, the uncurling of a fern and the arrangement of a pine cone. The Fibonacci numbers are also found in the family tree of honeybees.
