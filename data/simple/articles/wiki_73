Sudanese People's Liberation Army

Sudan's people liberation army (SPLA) and Sudan's people liberation movement is a political party in South Sudan. It was founded as a resistance movement / rebel group in 1963. As Sudan's people liberation army, it fought against the Sudanese government, in the Sudanese Civil War. This war ended in 2005. Officially, the movement wanted to create a free secular Sudan, which it called "New Sudan". In reality, however, many people in the movement wanted to create an independent state, South Sudan. In 2005, there was a peace treaty. From that moment, until 2011, the SPLM was part of the Sudanese government. Since the independence of South Sudan in 2011, the SPLM is de facto the only party in the country. In the south, the SPLA will become the regular army. In the north, the SPLM is still part of the government. In the provinces South Kordofan and Blue Nile, the SPLA is one of the armies fighting the government.

People swim using their arms and/or legs. Swimming can be divided into several "strokes": "breaststroke", "front crawl", "butterfly", and "backstroke" are some of them,but the main stroke that is easiest to swim is frontcrawl.
Swimmers move through the water using the combination of other body parts. Swimmers have to be able to stay under water with holding their breath for long time.

Swimming can be done for fun, for exercise, or as a competitive sport. Many schools use swimming as a physical training exercise or just to have some fun after a hard week in the gym or outside.

Biological control

Biological control, or biological pest control, is the reduction of pest populations by using natural enemies. It is important because crop pests become resistant to chemical pesticides.

Natural enemies of insect pests include predators, parasitoids, and pathogens. Biological control agents of weeds include herbivores and plant pathogens. Predators, such as birds, lady beetles and lacewings, are free-living species that eat many prey during their lifetime. 

Parasitoids are species whose larvae develop on or in a single insect host, ultimately killing or fatally infecting the host. Most have a very narrow host range. Many species of wasps and some flies are parasitoids. 

Pathogens are disease-causing organisms including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They kill or debilitate their host and are relatively specific.

There are three basic types of biological control strategies; conservation, classical biological control, and augmentation.

Auld Alliance

The Auld Alliance (Scots) () was an alliance between the kingdoms of Scotland and France. It played a major role in the relations between Scotland, France and England from its beginning in 1295 until the 1560 Treaty of Edinburgh. The alliance was renewed by all the French and Scottish monarchs of that period except for Louis XI. By the late 14th century, the treaty was renewed even in France or Scotland was not at war with England.

The alliance dates from the treaty signed by John Balliol and Philip IV of France in 1295 against Edward I of England. The terms of the treaty said that if either country was attacked by England, the other country would invade England. This happened at the Battle of Flodden Field, 1513. The alliance played an important role in conflicts between both countries and England, such as the Wars of Scottish Independence, the Hundred Years' War, the War of the League of Cambrai and the Rough Wooing.

In a speech which he delivered in Edinburgh in June 1942, Charles de Gaulle described the alliance between Scotland and France as "the oldest alliance in the world". He also declared that:
"In every combat where for five centuries the destiny of France was at stake, there were always men of Scotland to fight side by side with men of France, and what Frenchmen feel is that no people has ever been more generous than yours with its friendship."
In 1995, celebrations were held in both countries for the 700th anniversary of the beginning of the alliance.

Sosigenes the Peripatetic was a philosopher who lived in the 2nd century AD. He followed the Aristotelian school of thought, and was one of the first people to write interpretations and commentaries to Aristotle's work. He was the teacher of Alexander of Aphrodisias. He worked to "savr" the phenomena, he wanted to show that the movement of the stars, such as the sun, moon and planets could be reduced to the moement on an ideal circle line, or to the combination of such lines. On 4th September 164 AD, he watched a circular solar eclipse. He noticed, that unlike with a total solar eclipse, the visible size of the sun and the moon changed. For this reason, sun and moon could not be on circular movement with the same center. Much later, Nicolaus Copernicus used this idea to postulate a heliocentric view. In this view, the earth, moon and the planets rotate around the sun, which does not move.

Lacewing

Lacewings, or 'Green lacewings', are insects in the large family Chrysopidae of the order Neuroptera. There are about 85 genera and (differing between sources) 1,300–2,000 species in this widespread group. However, in America and Europe, the two genera "Chrysopa" and "Chrysoperla" are very common.

Most species of lacewings and their larvae are active predators, and are often used for biological control. 

Many adults of "Chrysopa" can defend themselves by giving out a vile smell from glands at the front of their thorax.

They have 'ears' at the base of their front wings. When they hear bat echolocation sounds, they close their wings and drop down. They can escape spider webs, because, being so light, they do not create much vibration to alert the spider. Instead of struggling like most insects, the lacewing bites through the strands holding its legs and antennae. When it is stuck only by its wings, it become completely immobile. Slowly, the lacewing slides downwards out of the web. Tiny hairs on the wings prevent the sticky spider silk from touching the wings' surface. 

The larvae are voracious, attacking other insects of suitable size, especially soft-bodied ones (aphids, caterpillars and other insect larvae, insect eggs). When they touch a potential prey object, the larva grasps it. Their maxillae are hollow, and inject a digestive secretion into the prey. The organs of an aphid can be dissolved by this in 90 seconds.

Pre-frontal cortex

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the front part of the frontal lobes of the brain. It lies in front of the motor and premotor areas.

This brain region helps plan complex cognitive behaviours, personality expression, decision making. It helps correct social behaviour. The basic activity of this brain region is to bring together thoughts and actions to help achieve internal goals.

The most typical psychological term for functions carried out by the prefrontal cortex area is executive function. This is the ability to work out conflicting thoughts. It determines good and bad, better and best, same and different, consequences of current activities, working toward a goal, prediction of outcomes, expectation of results. Critical is 'social control': the ability to suppress urges which, if not suppressed, could lead to socially unacceptable outcomes.

Many authors have indicated an integral link between a person's personality and the functions of the prefrontal cortex.

Infestations are difficult to control because of the insect's ability to survive without food for long periods, its preference for dry conditions and low-moisture food, and its resistance to many insecticides. There is a federal quarantine restricting the importation of rice into the U.S. from countries with known infestations of the beetle.

They grew up in Long Beach, California, where their parents had lived. Their parents divorced in 1997.

The Sprouses started acting at the age of six months. The twins first acted in a commercial for diapers. They switched on-screen time every few seconds. Similar to many twin actors, the two have often played the same role. This is so there is more time for the character to be filmed.

However, in the middle of 2010, Dylan said that they would not be doing the movie. Part of the reason they did not do it was because they became too old for the movie.

, Dylan and Cole are not acting in any shows or movies. They are paying attention to college. Also, Dylan is paying attention to art. Cole is paying attention to photography. Dylan has said that they would both like to continue acting while in college.

In 2007 Simon & Schuster Inc. published the two volumes of a book series named "Sprouse Bros. 47 R.O.N.I.N.", about two young spies. In 2008, the brothers ended their association with Dualstar. They continued their clothing line which is 'on hold'. The things in their clothing lines are only sold online.

Dylan Sprouse has said that the experience of becoming famous after the success of "The Suite Life of Zack & Cody" is "kind of scary, how fast everything is moving. Just a year ago none of this was happening, it was just doing "Suite Life", and now I can't wait for what's in store..." While filming "The Suite Life of Zack & Cody", the two went to school on-set for three hours each day. They said they were getting "straight A's and honors."

The twins' family has three dogs. Bubba is Dylan and Cole’s dog. Pinky is their father's dog. Curry is their stepmother's dog. Their favorite actor and co-star is Adam Sandler.

In 2010, the twin brothers were both accepted to New York University. At first, they planned to go to the university in the fall of 2010. However, they delayed going for one year. They are both in the Gallatin program. Students in this program make their own major.

TOEIC

The TOEIC is an examination for learners of English. It is mainly used in Japan, but is also important in some other countries. The test started in 1977. The full name of the exam is the "Test of English for International Communication". The Educational Testing Service (ETS) writes and gives the test.

The Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) is meant to measure English skills in everyday workplace activities.

The TOEIC Listening & Reading Test is a two-hour multiple-choice test. It has 200 questions. One hundred questions test listening comprehension, and the other 100 test reading comprehension. Test takers get separate scores for listening and reading on from 5 to 495 points. The total score adds up to from 10 to 990 points. The TOEIC certificate comes in five colors based on the scores:


ETS began to offer the TOEIC Speaking & Writing Test in 2006. Test takers get separate scores for each of the two tests. They can also take the Speaking test without taking the Writing test. The TOEIC Speaking Test takes about 20 minutes. The TOEIC Writing Test lasts about 60 minutes. Each test has a score between 0-200.

Nearly 1.5 million people take the TOEIC each year in Japan. The offers the test in Japan. There are two ways to take the TOEIC test. One is the TOEIC Secure Program (SP), the other is the TOEIC Institutional Testing Program (ITP). The SP is offered at a set place and time, and test takers go there for the exam. In the ITP, a group such as a university gives the test when and where they like. Groups giving the ITP test must follow the test rules.

The Institute for International Business Communication had a scandal in 2009.

The IIBC’s 92 year-old Chairman Yaeji Watanabe made his girlfriend's son Chairman of the IIBC Board of Directors. Watanabe forced out half the board of directors. Also, Watanabe only worked about one day a week. Watanabe's salary was more than 25 million yen each year. Watanabe said he was Chairman in name only and had little to do with choosing the new chairman. Then, Watanabe suddenly quit the IIBC. The son of his girlfriend was in charge of the non-profit company. The IIBC paid Watanabe 25 million yen for his retirement.

The IIBC lowered the price of the TOEIC Secure Program Test from 6,615 yen to 5,985 yen from September 13, 2009. Ministry of Trade asked the IIBC to lower the price because the test was making too much money.

IIBC has a for-profit partner company called International Communications School (ICS). In July 2010, the Tokyo Tax Bureau announced that ICS lied about 100 million yen in income. ICS had to pay 30 million yen in taxes and fines.

South Korea is the second largest user of TOEIC by population. But, some major corporations have stopped using TOEIC scores for employment, or have required lower scores. 
From 2011, Korean universities are no longer be allowed to use TOEIC and TOEFL scores as part of the selecting students. Seoul National University has developed another English proficiency test, TEPS. It may replace TOEIC.

In France, some Grandes écoles require a TOEIC score of at least 785 for a diploma. Some people think this is wrong because it means a diploma from a state school depends on a private corporation. The "Commission des Titres d'Ingénieurs" set the 785 score as similar to a B2+ level on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.
Student who cannot score 785 may have to show their English language ability in some other way. Some schools allow one more year after the end of studies to complete the diploma.

In Greece, TOEIC is accepted by ASEP as part of hiring new government workers.

TOEIC is used by some universities in Italy. All universities require that students pass an English examination before entering a degree courses or receiving diplomas. Students usually need a TOEIC score of 600 to earn a diploma. Many universities allow other tests such as the Cambridge certificate and TOEFL.

TOEIC Bridge is a simpler version of the TOEIC test. This test is for beginning and intermediate speakers. It has 100 multiple-choice questions. The test lasts about one hour.

Lady Macbeth

Lady Macbeth is a fictional character in William Shakespeare's play "Macbeth" (c.1603–1607). She is the wife to the play's main character, Macbeth, a Scottish nobleman. After talking him into killing the king, she becomes Queen of Scotland. Later, she feels bad about her part in the crime. She dies off-stage in the last act. This is thought to be suicide.

The idea for the character came from Kings Duff and Duncan in "Holinshed's Chronicles" (1587), a history of Britain familiar to Shakespeare. Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth appears to be made up of two personalities in Holinshed's work. These are Donwald's nagging, murderous wife in the account of King Duff and Macbeth's ambitious wife in the account of King Duncan.

Tanggu Truce

The Tanggu , sometimes called the "Tangku Truce" () ) was a ceasefire signed between China and Empire of Japan in Tanggu District, Tianjin on May 31, 1933, formally ending the Japanese invasion of Manchuria which had begun two years earlier.

After the Mukden Incident of September 18, 1931, the Japanese Kwantung Army invaded Manchuria, and by February 1932 had captured the entire region. The last emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Puyi, who was living in exile in Tianjin was invited by the Japanese to accept the throne of the new Empire of Manchukuo, which was controlled by the Japanese army. In January 1933, to guard Manchukuo’s southern borders, a joint Japanese and Manchukuo force invaded Rehe, and after conquering that province by March, drove the remaining Chinese armies in the northeast outside the Great Wall into Hebei Province.
The Western powers blamed Japan's actions but did little else. When the League of Nations demanded that Japan stop fighting, the Japan withdrew from the League on March 27, 1933.
As the Japanese army was under clear orders from Emperor Hirohito (who wanted a quick end to the fight with China) not to go into the Great Wall, the Japanese halted their attack in May 1933.

On May 22, 1933, Chinese and Japanese representatives met to talk the end of the fight. The Japanese demands were serious: a demilitarized zone covering one hundred kilometers south of the Great Wall, from Beijing to Tianjin was to be set up, with the Great Wall itself under Japanese control. No regular Kuomintang military units were to be allowed in the zone, although the Japanese were allowed to use scout aircraft or ground patrols to check that the agreement was maintained. Public order within the zone was to be maintained by a police unit Demilitarized Zone Peace Preservation Corps.
Two secret clauses left out any of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies from this Peace Preservation Corps and provided for any problems that could not be fixed by the Peace Preservation Corps to be arranged by agreement between the Japanese and Chinese governments. Having lost every major battles and much territory, and with the Chinese government under Chiang Kai-shek more concerned with fighting the Chinese Communist Party than the Japanese, the Chinese government agreed to all demands. Furthermore, the new demilitarized zone was mostly within the remaining territory of the Manchurian warlord Zhang Xueliang.

The Tanggu Truce resulted in the "de facto" recognition of Manchukuo by the Kuomingtang government, and acceptance of the loss of Rehe. It brought a short end to the combat between China and Japan and for a brief period, relations between the two countries improved. On May 17, 1935, the Japanese legation in China was improved to the status of , and on June 10, 1935, the He-Umezu Agreement was concluded. The Tanggu Truce gave Chiang kai Shek time to merge his forces and to focus his efforts against the Chinese Communist Party, though at the cost of northern China. However, Chinese public opinion was opposing to truce so favorable to Japan and so shameful to China. Although the Truce set up a demilitarized buffer zone, Japanese territorial desires towards China remained, and the Truce proved to be only a short break until fightings broke out again with the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937.

On September 18, 1931, a little amount of dynamite was blown up by a Japanese soldier near a Japan's South Manchuria Railway near Mukden. Although the explosion was so weak that the rail was still useable, the Japanese army, blaming the action on the Chinese people, fully invading Manchuria and leading to its occupation. Japan set up its puppet state of Manchukuo six months later. Soon the world knew the event, leading Japan to diplomatic isolation and its withdrawl from the League of Nations.

Parietal lobe

The parietal lobe is a part of the brain positioned above the occipital lobe and behind the frontal lobe. 

The parietal lobe brings together information from different senses, particularly spatial sense and navigation. For example, it uses input about touch, balance and the visual system. This enables the parietal cortex to map seen objects in relation to the body (into 'body coordinate positions'). This makes it possible for a person to reach out and handle objects.

The name derives from the overlying parietal bone, which is named from the Latin "pariet-", = 'wall'.

<doc id="314487" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314487" title="Frontal lobe">
Frontal lobe

The frontal lobe is an area in the brain of humans and other mammals, at the front of each cerebral hemisphere. It is in front of the parietal lobe and above and in front of the temporal lobes. 

It is separated from the parietal lobe by a space between tissues called the central sulcus, and from the temporal lobe by a deep fold called the lateral (Sylvian) sulcus. The precentral gyrus, forming the back of the frontal lobe, contains the primary motor cortex, which controls voluntary movements of specific body parts.

The frontal lobes takes action based on sensory information (sight, sound, touch) from the three rear areas of the cerebrum, moderated by the influence of the pre-frontal cortex. The system is a delicate balance between the need to satisfy urges from the most ancient parts of the brain, such as hunger, self-defence and sex, with the need to act in a way which is socially acceptable. 

For many years, many scientists thought that the frontal lobe was comparatively larger in humans compared to other primates. They thought that this was an important feature of human evolution and was the primary reason why human cognition is different from that of the other primates. However, this view has been challenged by later research. Using magnetic resonance imaging to determine the volume of the frontal cortex in humans, all living ape species and several monkey species, Semendeferi "et al." found that the human frontal cortex was not relatively larger than the cortex in the other great apes but was relatively larger than the frontal cortex in the lesser apes and the monkeys.

<doc id="314492" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314492" title="Temporal lobe">
Temporal lobe

The temporal lobe is a region of the cerebral cortex that is under the Sylvian fissure on both cerebral hemispheres of the mammalian brain.

The temporal lobe is involved in auditory perception and is home to the primary auditory cortex. It is also important for the processing of semantics (meaning) in both speech and vision. The temporal lobe contains the hippocampus and plays a key role in the formation of long-term memory.

An area in the Sylvian fissure is the first place where auditory signals from the cochlea reach the cerebral cortex. This part of the cortex (primary auditory cortex) is involved in hearing. Other areas of the temporal lobes are involved in high-level auditory processing. In humans this includes speech, for which the left temporal lobe in particular seems to be specialized. Wernicke's area, which spans the region between temporal and parietal lobes, plays a key role (with Broca's area, which is in the frontal lobe). The functions of the left temporal lobe extends to comprehension, naming, verbal memory and other language functions. 

The underside of the temporal lobes do high-level visual processing of faces and scenes. Front parts of this area are involved in object perception and recognition.

Deep inside the medial temporal lobes lie the hippocampus, which is essential for memory function – particularly the transfer from short to long term memory and control of spatial memory and behaviour.

The name is from the Greek κοχλίας "kokhlias" ("snail, screw"), from κόχλος "kokhlos" ("spiral shell"). This is in reference to its coiled shape: the cochlea is coiled in most mammals, monotremes being the exceptions.

Super Size Me is a 2004 American documentary film directed by and starring Morgan Spurlock. It is about an experiment where Spurlock ate nothing but food from McDonald's for thirty days. He ate at McDonald's three times a day, eating an average of 5,000 kcal per day. This experiment lasted from February 1 to March 2, 2003. This experiment was bad for his own physical and psychological health. 

During the experiment, Spurlock gained 24½ lbs., had a 13% body mass increase, his cholesterol level went to 230, and he had mood swings, sexual dysfunction, and had fat accumulation in his liver. After the experiment, he recovered with a vegan diet his then-future wife prepared for him (she is a gourmet vegan cook). 

This experiment was conducted because of the obesity epidemic in the United States, and because of a case in which two teenage girls sued McDonald's who claimed they became obese as a result of eating food from McDonald's.

Spurlock also uses this film to criticize McDonald's and the fast food industry, ranging from the sale of unhealthy food to corporate marketing and to the personal profit of these organizations.

Non-Newtonian fluid

A non-newtonian fluid is a thixotropic fluid which changes its viscosity when the shearing forces it is exposed to change. Other flow properties may also be affected. Most commonly viscosity of such fluids is not independent of the shear rate or the shear rate history. Examples of such fluids are blood, quicksand and certain components of cement. Many lubricants, ketchup, certain forms of dough and pudding also have this property. 

The other kind of fluids that do not show this behaviour are called Newtonian fluids.

The current members of the Schengen Area are Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Because Switzerland isn't part of the European Economic Area, the border control for stuff in Switzerland still lasts. At this moment, 400 million people live in the area and it's 4,312,099 square kilometres.

On 14 June 1985 the Schengen Agreement was signed. This happened on the boat "Princess Marie-Astrid" in the middle of the river Moselle. On that place, the borders of France, Germany and Luxembourg meet. Five countries signed the Agreement: Belgium, France, Luxembourg and West-Germany. It was signed, but that didn't mean it was already implented.

In 1995, all European Union-members (except the United Kingdom and Ireland) signed the Agreement too. Also Norway and Iceland, countries that weren't in the European Union, signed it. 

The Schengen Area now exists of twenty-five countries. All those are member of the European Union, except Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.

In some other educational systems and subjects, undergraduate education is between secondary education and a master's degree, for example in some science and engineering courses in Britain and some medicine courses in Europe.
In the United States of America undergraduate education gives a bachelor's degree. Many times, it is four years of study leading to a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), a Bachelor of Science (B.S.), or sometimes another bachelor's degree such as Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.), Bachelor of Social Work (B.S.W.), Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.), Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs (B.S.P.A), or Bachelor of Philosophy (B.Phil.) Five-Year Professional Architecture programs offer the Bachelor of Architecture Degree (B.Arch.).

Unlike in the British model, degrees in law and medicine are not offered at the undergraduate level and are completed as graduate study after earning a bachelor's degree. Neither field specifies or prefers any undergraduate major, though medicine has set prerequisite courses that must be taken before enrollment. However, nursing is taught as an undergraduate program.

Some students choose to attend a community college or junior college for two years prior to further study at another college or university.
Students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland may usually enter a university at the age of 18, often after passing A-levels. (This could take 13 to 15 years of schooling.) Some times students who finish A Level or equivalent qualifications early (after skipping a year in school on the grounds of academic talent) may enter before age 18.

<doc id="314567" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314567" title="Thixotropy">
Thixotropy

Thixotropy is the property of certain gels or fluids that are thick (viscous) under normal conditions, but flow (become thin, less viscous) when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.

In more technical language:
some Non-Newtonian fluids show a change in viscosity; the longer the fluid undergoes shear stress, the lower its viscosity. A thixotropic fluid is a fluid which takes a finite time to attain equilibrium viscosity when introduced to a step change in shear rate. Many gels and colloids are thixotropic materials, exhibiting a stable form at rest but becoming fluid when agitated. 

Some fluids are anti-thixotropic: constant shear stress for a time causes an increase in viscosity or even solidification. Constant shear stress can be applied by shaking or mixing. They are much less common.

It is a common experience walking on sand that in places it liquifies as one walks on it. This is a thixotropic response to pressure. In extremes, a quicksand may be danger to man and animals.

Some clays are thixotropic, with their behaviour is of great importance in structural and geotechnical engineering. Landslides, such as those common in the cliffs around Lyme Regis, Dorset and in the Aberfan disaster in Wales are evidence of this. Similarly, a lahar is a mass of earth liquefied by a volcanic event, which rapidly solidifies once coming to rest. 

Drilling muds used in geotechnical applications can be thixotropic. Honey from honey bees may also exhibit this property under certain conditions.(Heather honey). 

Another example of a thixotropic fluid is the synovial fluid found in joints between some bones.

Some clay deposits found in the process of exploring caves exhibit thixotropism: an initially solid-seeming mudbank will turn soupy and yield up moisture when dug into or otherwise disturbed. These clays were deposited in the past by low-velocity streams which tend to deposit fine-grained sediment.

These properties are often used in commercial products which are applied to surfaces, such as paint or toothpaste. With paint, the fluidity vanishes quickly and the surface sets permanently as water (or oil) evaporates.

Pope Urban V

Pope Urban V (1310 – December 19, 1370), born Guillaume Grimoard, was an French cleric of the Roman Catholic Church and the 201st Pope from 1362 until his death in 1370.

He was the sixth of the seven popes who lived in Avignon in France.

Grimoard was born in Grizac in the Languedoc region of France. 

He became a Benedictine monk; and he was ordained at Chirac. 

Grimoard became the abbot of Saint-Victor in Marseille.

He was not a cardinal. There were several Popes who were not Cardinals. Some of these were Pope Urban IV and Pope Urban VI.

Grimoard was elected pope on September 28, 1362; and he chose to be called Pope Urban. 

Pope Urban was involved in Italian and European political disputes.

In 1367, the pope traveled from Avignon to Rome. He returned to Avignon in where he died in 1370.

In 1870, Urban V was beatified by Pope Pius IX.

Squad automatic weapon

A squad automatic weapon, sometimes called a light support weapon or even just a SAW, is a kind of gun which is used to give a squad of soldiers a good amount of fully automatic gunfire. The weapons used as squad automatic weapons are selective fire. This means that the gunner can choose which fire mode of fire the gun is put in. Some good examples of these are fully automatic, semi-automatic and three-round burst. They are usually fitted with a bipod or tripod so that they can be like light machine guns. SAWs usually fire the same cartridge as the assault rifles or battle rifles that are carried by other soldiers in the squad. This makes logistics easier because they only need to give one type of ammunition to a squad. SAWs are light enough to be used by only one person.

<doc id="314603" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314603" title="Sign (mathematics)">
Sign (mathematics)

In mathematics, the word sign refers to the property of being positive or negative. Every real number (that is not zero) is either positive or negative, and therefore has a sign. Zero itself is without a sign, or signless. In addition to putting signs in to real numbers, the word sign is used throughout mathematics to indicate parts of mathematical objects that mean positivity and negativity. Usually, if numbers are seen without a sign, they are seen as a positive number.

The word sign is also sometimes used to refer to various mathematical signs, such as the plus and minus signs and the multiplication sign.

A real number is said to be positive if it is greater than zero, and negative if it is less than zero. The attribute of being positive or negative is called the sign of the number. Zero itself is not considered to have a sign.

In arithmetic, the sign of a number is often denoted by placing a plus or minus sign before the number. For example, +3 would denote a positive 3, and −3 would denote a negative 3. When no plus or minus sign is given, the main way of seeing it is that a number is positive.

The sign of any number that is not zero can be changed to positive using the absolute value function. For example, the absolute value of −3 and the absolute value of 3 are both equal to 3. In symbols, this would be written |−3| = 3 and |3| = 3.

The number zero is neither positive nor negative, and therefore has no sign. In arithmetic, +0 and −0 both mean the same number 0.

Because zero is neither positive nor negative, the following are sometimes used to refer to the sign of an unknown number:
Thus a non-negative number is either positive or zero, while a non-positive number is either negative or zero. For example, the absolute value of a real number is always non-negative, but is not necessarily positive.

The same definition is sometimes used for functions that take real or integer values. For example, a function would be called positive if all of its values are positive, or non-negative if all of its values are non-negative.

In many texts, it is common to see a sign together with the measure of an angle, particularly a located angle or an angle of rotation. In such a situation, the sign says whether the angle is in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Though different conventions can be used, it is common in mathematics to have counterclockwise angles count as positive, and clockwise angles count as negative.

It is also possible to put a sign to an angle of rotation in three dimensions, assuming the axis of rotation has been oriented. Specifically, a right-handed turn around an axis usually counts as positive, while a left-handed rotation counts as negative.

In arithmetic and physics, it is common to label certain directions as positive or negative. For a basic example, the number line is usually drawn with positive numbers to the right, and negative numbers to the left:
On the Cartesian plane, the rightward and upward directions are usually thought of as positive, with rightward being the positive "x"-direction, and upward being the positive "y"-direction.

In addition to the sign of a real number, the word sign is also used in various related ways throughout mathematics and the sciences:

Exxon Valdez oil spill

The Exxon Valez oil spill was one of the worst man-made environmental disasters in United States history. It happened when an oil tanker, the "Exxon Valez", hit a reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska. At the time of the disaster, the ship had about 160,000 tons of oil on board; it could take a maximum of 210,000 tons. Later, people looked at the causes, and found that the people on board were badly trained and overworked. What made things worse was the fact that the government was not prepared to handle a disaster with such large consequences for the environment; 37,000 tons of crude oil were released into the environment.

Pope Urban VI (c. 1318 – October 15, 1389), born Bartolomeo Prignano, was an Italian priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 203rd Pope from 1378 to 1389.

Prignano was born in Naples. 

In 1364, Prignano was made the Archbishop of Acerenza by Pope Urban V.

Pope Gregory XI made Prignano Archbishop of Bari in 1377.

He was not a cardinal. There were several Popes who were not Cardinals. Some of these were Pope Urban V and Pope Urban V.

Prignano was elected pope on April 18, 1378; and he chose to be called Pope Urban VI. 

A period called the "Western Schism" began on 20 September 20, 1378 when Robert of Geneva (also known as Clement VII) was chosen pope by 13 French cardinals. Clement VII is now considered to have been an antipope. 

A large part of Germany, Flanders, Italy (with exception of Naples), England and Ireland recognized Urban VI as the pope; but many in Western Europe supported the papacy of Clement VII.

Rocca Petru

Rocca Petru was a poet and writer from Corsica, who wanted his island free from France.
Initially he supported the Italian irredentism in Corsica, then promoted the autonomism of Corsica after World War II.

Rocca, called Petru in Corsican, was -since young age- a gifted writer and contributed in Corsica to the magazine "A Tramuntana". During World War I wrote about the war and was decorated with the French Legion of Honor.

Since may 1920 Rocca worked with the literary magazine "A Muvra" (during the first half of the 20th century the most important Corsican publication in Italian was the literary review "A Muvra" of Petru Rocca). In 1922 he created the Partitu Corsu d'Azione, following the model of the Italian Partito Sardo d'Azione of Sardinia that had autonomism ideals.

Successively he created in the late 1920s the "Partito autonomista di Corsica" (of which was segretary) with the support of monsignor Domenico Parlotti and dr. Croce, director of the "Archivi di Stato della Corsica".

During the late 1930s Rocca slowly changed his political opinions from the autonomism for his Corsica to the Italian irredentism ideals, supporting the union of Corsica to Italy. He supported the ideals of Petru Giovacchini, an irredentist leader who created the main pro-Italian political organization in Corsica: the "Gruppi d’Azione Irredentista Corsa" . 

In 1938, the French government punished him, because of his approach to the Italian Risorgimento ideals, eliminating his "Ordre de la légion d'honneur": "A Muvra" started in 1939 to write articles against the Jews (responsible in Rocca's opinion for the French "occupation" of Corsica) and was quickly closed.

During World War II Rocca supported Benito Mussolini 's ideals about the union of Corsica to the Kingdom of Italy. And when Italian troops occupied the island in 1942, he was proposed to be "Governor" of a Corsica united to Italy. After the Italian defeat in september 1943, Rocca was harrassed by the french authorities.

As a consequence of this in 1946 he was sentenced to 15 years of jail and sent to the French Guiana (Devil's Island). When released, he quickly recreated his original "Partito autonomista di Corsica".

In 1953, Rocca created an academy for the defense of the Corsican language and demanded from France the acceptance of the Corsican people and language and the creation of the University of Corte. Rocca was, until his death in 1966, a strong supporter of the creation of the Corsican nationalism.

FC Lustenau 07 is an football club from Lustenau, Vorarlberg in Austria. They play in the Austrian Football First League. The club is the oldest football club in Vorarlberg.
The roots of the club laid in the Turnverein Lustenau. Many of the young members of the club played football. After discussions the football section left the club and formed on 20 September 1907 at the Gasthof zur Sonne the FC Lustenau. Many of the clubs in Vorarlberg were founded with the help of players of FC Lustenau(for example FC Dornbirn 1913 and the second club from Lustenau SC Austria Lustenau ). During the First World War there was no football in Vorarlberg. But after the war many new clubs were found. So the FC Lustenau was interested in forming a football associaton, which was formed in 1920.

The most important player of FC Lustenau before the Second World War was Ernst Künz.He played in the 1936 Olympic football team of Austria. The team won the silver medal.

During the Second World war there was again no football in Vorarlberg. But 1945 the team started again under the name FC Rapid Lustenau. In 1947 they got their old name FC Lustenau 07 back. In 2000 the club was promoted to the Austrian First League. 2004 they were relegated. In the 2005/06 season they won the Regionalliga West with 27 wins, 3 draws and 0 lost (104:22 goals). They were again promoted and play at the moment again in the first league which is the second division in Austrian football.

In the Realm of the Senses is a romantic movie which was released during 1976 in certain countries, 1977 in others. The movie is a fictional tale of sexually explicit adult behavior in 1930s Japan. This motion picture caused extremely huge controversy when it was released. Certain countries wouldn't even show the movie. Moreover, it was not available for home video until around 1990. It was originally rated X, though the rating was later converted into NC-17 in 1991.

Colloid

A colloid is a mixture of one substance spread out evenly inside another substance. They can be in two different phases or states of matter. 

One substance is the dispersion medium, such as water or gas. The other is the dispersed medium, sometimes called the 'internal phase'. This is usually tiny solid particles. Otherwise, if the dispersion medium is a gas, then the internal phase can be either tiny particles or tiny droplets of a liquid.

Definition: A colloid is a substance microscopically dispersed evenly throughout another substance. The dispersed-phase particles have a diameter between about 5 and 200 nanometers.

Lyme Regis

Lyme Regis is a coastal town in West Dorset, England, 25 miles west of Dorchester and east of Exeter. The town lies in Lyme Bay, on the English Channel coast at the Dorset-Devon border. It is nicknamed 'The Pearl of Dorset'. 

The town is noted for the fossils found in the cliffs and beaches, which are part of the Jurassic Coast—a World Heritage Site. The harbour wall, "The Cobb", features in Jane Austen's novel "Persuasion", and in the film and novel, "The French Lieutenant's Woman", by local writer John Fowles.

The town's population at the most recent census was 4,406, 45% of whom were retired.

The town is noted for the fossils found in the cliffs and beaches, which are part of the Jurassic Coast—a World Heritage Site. The Jurassic Coast stretches over a distance of . 

The coastal exposures along the coastline provide a continuous sequence of Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous rock formations spanning approximately 185 million years of the Earth's history. The localities along the Jurassic Coast include some important fossil zones.
The Blue Lias rock is host to a multitude of remains from the early Jurassic, a time from which good fossil records are rare. Many of the remains are well preserved, with complete specimens of several important species. Many of the earliest discoveries of dinosaur and other prehistoric reptile remains were made in the area surrounding Lyme Regis, notably those discovered by Mary Anning (1799–1847). Significant finds include "Ichthyosaur", "Plesiosaur", "Dimorphodon", "Scelidosaurus", one of the first armoured (Thyreophora) dinosaurs. The town now holds an annual Mary Anning Day and Lyme Regis Fossil Festival. A fossil of the world's largest moth was discovered in 1966 at Lyme Regis.

The coastal region near Lyme Regis is subject to large landslips. This means that Jurassic age fossils are regularly exposed and can be found on the beaches, but also causes devastation to the town.

One of the most spectacular landslips occurred on 24 December 1839, west along the coast in Devon belonging to Bindon Manor and known as "The Dowlands Landslip". About of fields growing wheat and turnips were dislodged when a great chasm was formed more than across, deep and long. The crops remained intact on the top of what became known as "Goat Island" among the newly formed gullies. On 3 February 1840, five weeks later, there was a second landslip nearby but much smaller than the former. This strange phenomenon attracted many visitors, and the canny farmers charged sixpence for entrance and held a grand reaping party when the wheat ripened. The area is now known as The Undercliff and is of great interest because of its diverse natural history.

In 2005, work began on a £16 million engineering project to stabilise the cliffs and protect the town from coastal erosion. The town's main beach was reconstructed and re-opened on 1 July 2006.
On the evening of 6 May 2008, a section of land slipped onto the beach between Lyme Regis and Charmouth. Local Police described the landslip as the "worst for 100 years".

Non-renewable resource

A non-renewable resource is a natural resource which cannot be produced, grown, generated, or used on a scale which can sustain its consumption rate. Once it is used up, there is no more available for future needs. Also considered non-renewable are resources that are consumed much faster than nature can create them. Fossil fuels (such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas), types of nuclear power (uranium) and certain aquifers are examples. Resources such as timber (when harvested sustainably) or metals (which can be recycled) are considered renewable resources.

<doc id="314709" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314709" title="Perpetual resource">
Perpetual resource

A perpetual resource has a never-ending supply.

The ASTM definition for a perpetual resource is "one that is virtually inexhaustible on a human time-scale". Examples given include solar energy, tidal energy, and wind energy. Other examples are salt, stone, magnesium, and diamonds. A study on the biogeophysical aspects of sustainability came up with a rule of prudent practice that a resource stock should last 700 years to achieve sustainability or become a perpetual resource, or for a worse case, 350 years.

The perpetual resource concept is a complex one because it changes with new technology (usually more efficient recovery), new needs, and to a lesser degree with new economics (e.g. changes in prices of the material, changes in energy costs, etc.). On the one hand, a material (and its resources) can enter a time of shortage and become a strategic and critical material (an immediate exhaustibility crisis), but on the other hand a material can go out of use, its resource can proceed to being perpetual if it was not before, and then the resource can become a paleoresource when the material goes almost completely out of use (e.g. resources of arrowhead-grade flint). Some of the complexities influencing resources of a material include the extent of recyclability, the availability of suitable substitutes for the material in its end-use products, or other reasons.

<doc id="314726" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314726" title="Kimmeridge Clay">
Kimmeridge Clay

The Kimmeridge Clay Formation is a sedimentary deposit of fossiliferous marine clay which is of Upper Jurassic age. It occurs in Europe. It gives its name to a stage in the Upper Jurassic called the Kimmeridgian, lasting from 155.7–150.8 million years ago.

Kimmeridge Clay is perhaps the most economically important unit of rocks in the whole of Europe, because it is the major source for oil fields in the North Sea. 

It is named after the village of Kimmeridge on the Dorset coast of England, where it is well exposed anf forms part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. It exists across England, in a band stretching from Dorset in the south-west, north-east to East Anglia and Hull. The Humber Bridge's foundations are in the Kimmeridge Clay deposits under the Humber estuary.

The fossil fauna of the Kimmeridge Clay includes a reptile fauna of turtles, crocodiles, dinosaurs, plesiosaurs, pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs, as well as many invertebrate species.

The Kimmeridge Clay of the Upper Jurassic was laid down in 
an environment which is not present on the earth today, with much of Western Europe being covered by a high sea-level which has been related to opening of the Atlantic. The consequence of this is that the UK was covered by a shallow and largely anoxic sea, perhaps less than 100m deep, with occasional landmasses. 

This was shallower water than the Blue Lias of the Lower Jurassic. It was often low in oxygen, which in turn led to only partially decomposition of its organic material. The mudstones are organic-rich, and gave rise to most of the North Sea oil.

Orbital forcing

Orbital forcing is the effect on climate of slow changes in the tilt of the Earth's axis and shape of the orbit (see Milankovitch cycles). These orbital changes alter the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth by up to 25% at mid-latitudes. In this context, the term "forcing" is a physical process that affects the Earth's climate.

This mechanism is believed to be responsible for the timing of the ice age cycles. The timing of past glacial periods coincides very well with the predictions of the Milankovitch theory, and these effects can be calculated into the future.

Note in the graphic the strong 100,000 year periodicity of the cycles, and the striking asymmetry of the curves. Ice ages deepen by progressive steps, but the recovery to interglacial conditions occurs in one big step.

Sungai Petani (abbreviated ""Sg. Petani"" or ""SP"") is a town in the state of Kedah, in the northern part of Peninsular Malaysia. Sungai Petani is the second largest town in Kedah after Alor Star. The name Sungai Petani has its roots from "sungai" meaning river and "petani" meaning farmer in the Malay language. Sungai Petani in full means "Farmer's River", as there are a lot of paddy fields and farmers in the state. The word "petani" may also refer to "Pattani", a city in present day Thailand to which the river was once connected. Even the old spelling of Sungai Petani was "Sungei Patani", without any reference to farming.

Sungai Petani is designated as a parliamentary area in its own right. A total of 983,851 people (2008) are able to vote. It is currently represented by Johari Abdul from Parti Keadilan Rakyat.

The parliamentary area of Merbok and part of the parliamentary area of Yan (Gurun) form part of Sungai Petani Municipal administrative area.

The nearest airport is the Penang International Airport on Penang Island. Another alternative airport is the Sultan Abdul Halim Airport, Alor Star (the state capital of Kedah).

Sungai Petani has various health amenities such as the Sultan Abdul Halim Hospital, a USD150-million hospital, and various private medical facilities. It is one of the most high-tech hospitals in Malaysia with Total Hospital Information System. The Sultan Abdul Halim Hospital was handed over by the Public Works Department to the Health Ministry on July 23, 2006. It is a 498-bed hospital which provides secondary and tertiary specialist services.

The hospital provides laparoscopic gynaecology operations. It is a recognized training center for gynaecologists in this field. It is also a center for thoracic surgery for the northern part of Peninsular Malaysia. This hospital is a training hospital for a local private medical university, AIMST University.

There are also two private hospitals in Sungai Petani: the Metro Specialist Hospital and Hospital Pantai Utara.

The District Education Department located in Sungai Petani administers two districts of Kuala Muda and Yan with the highest number of primary and secondary schools in the state of Kedah.

The Kolej Universiti Insaniah (KUIN) is a private university operating from two campuses in Kedah and one of them is located in Sungai Petani.

Sungai Petani offers high potential of growth in tourism industry specifically in Historic Themes, Ecotourism and Aqua sports. The district of Kuala Muda in which Sungai Petani is located is having the 2nd largest mangroove area in the country. Ecotourism is now in continuous development. From Sungai Emas to Bukit Meriam, Bujang/Merbok, Pulau Tiga and Kota Kuala Muda one can trace the path of Kedah ancient capitals.

Pulau Tiga, near Laguna Merbok was once the location of His Highness Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin's palace and his headquarters after being defeated and drove away by the Siamese in the Battle for Kuala Kedah Fort in the 18th. century. For not so long after, the Siamese attacked the new palace and razed it down. The Sultan escaped to Penang and then Malacca. Kedah was then broken into several administrative territories and ruled by respective Siamese Military Governors. A few years later, after a peace negotiation, the Siamese agreed to re-install His Highness as the Sultan of Kedah with a new throne at the Kuala Muda Fort. The smaller territories were then merged back as Kedah state with the military governors replaced by a Siamese Resident Advisor.

The present military camp was a RAF Aerodrome during the WWII and was heavily bombed by the Japanese Airforce on the first day of the invasion of Malaya. The 6th. Brigade (Army) was historically full of military exploits/combats/battles during the Communist Insurgency in the 1970s. There are a large numbers of military cemeteries of Ghurkas' and Commenwealth soldiers. There are a numbers of fallen heroes during the insurgency that came from this command. One was the downing of a Nuri helicopter by the rebels near the Thai border that killed more than a dozen soldiers. The communists had ceased all hostilities since 1989, when a peace treaty with the Malaysian government was signed.

The military camp also is the headquarters of the 19th. Royal Malay Regiments with war records such as the famous Black Hawk Downs battle in Mogadishu, Somalia. They helped rescued the surrounded US soldiers with one casualty of their own Regiment members.

The present District Police Headquarters was the headquarters/camp of the Police Field Force Battalion during the insurgency. The paramilitary police too has their shares of fallen heroes during the insurgency.

The bloody legend of Raja Bersiong (the King with Fangs) whom was believed to be one of the rulers of ancient Kedah was originated from the Lembah Bujang (or Bujangha in Sanskrit = Big Snake = Dragon ), one of the 2 valleys (Lembah Muda is the other) that covers half of the Sungai Petani surrounding landscape. The other half is the highland of Gunung Jerai. There are two major rivers Sungai Merbok and Sungai Muda that are suitable for aquasport. There are also abandoned open mining/quarry pools that are suitable for water tourism. Gunung Jerai offers an abundance of waterfalls.

The major of Sungai Petani is a clock tower located on the main street, Jalan Ibrahim. The clock tower was built in 1936. It is 12.1 m in height. It is topped by a dome-shaped and gold coloured structure. The tower was a present from Lim Lean Teng to George V and Queen Mary to commemorate the Silver Jubilee.

Sungai Petani is also known for its green lungs and attractions. In the heart of the town is the Jubli Perak (Silver Jubilee) public park and also Bird Park. There are more than five golf courses around Sungai Petani, as well as various streams, rivers and lakes.

The Swiss Inn Hotel (owned by Swiss-Garden International Hotels, Resorts & Inns) is located on the north of Sungai Petani. Conveniently located about 5 minutes from the North Sungai Petani tol. Besides that, another popular hotel in Sungai Petani is the Park Avenue Hotel which is located about 5 minutes from the South Sungai Petani tol. Also in the same area the Emerald Puteri Hotel and Northern Lodge Hotel is situated. D'vista Hotel and Amanpura Hotel (formerly known as SP Inn) is located in the heart of Sungai Petani town, its strategic location makes it walking distance to various places such as Central Square and the local bus station. The Seri Malaysia Hotel Sungai Petani located opposite the Sungai Petani railway station, which is nearby to the town as well.

The Sungai Petani Club (SP Club) is a vibrant meeting and recreational venue for the residents of Sungai Petani. Situated in the middle of the town, it is the oldest golf club in the State of Kedah, having been established in 1922 by British planters. The unique colonial facade and antique wooden interiors of the clubhouse would render it as a heritage site in Sungai Petani. The 9-hole golf course covering of prime land provides green space to balance the rapid pace of development of the town with environmental conservation.

Cinta Sayang Golf & Country Resort is located only 30 minutes from Penang and Kedah’s capital, Alor Setar. Its strategic location gives the Resort an advantage as a tour and shopping agent to Penang, Langkawi and Hat Yai. Cinta Sayang Golf & Country Resort was an 18-hole golf course with only 50-room chalets. Throughout the years, with constant development and upgrading, the Resort is now a proud 4-star golf resort, awarded by the Minister of Tourism Malaysia.

In the northern part of the town, about 30 kilometres away, is the famous Gunung Jerai. Gunung Jerai is 1,217 metres from the sea level. This is the tallest mountain in the northern region and is surrounded by a vast jungle.

States of Malaysia

Malaysia is a federation which consists of thirteen states ("Negeri") and three federal territories ("Wilayah Persekutuan"). Eleven states and two federal territories are located on the Malay Peninsula while the remaining two states and one federal territory are on the island of Borneo.

Malaysia is a federation consisting of 13 states ("Negeri") and 3 federal territories ("Wilayah Persekutuan"). These are divided between the two regions of Malaysia, with 11 states and 2 federal territories on Peninsula Malaysia and the other 2 states and 1 federal territory in East Malaysia. 

As Malaysia is a federation, the governance of the states is divided between the federal and the state governments, while the Federal government has direct administration of the federal territories. The specific responsibilities of the federal and the state governments are listed in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution of Malaysia. Theoretically, any matter not set out in the Ninth Schedule can be legislated on by the individual states. However, legal scholars generally view this as a "pauper's bequest" because of the large scope of the matters listed in the Ninth Schedule. The courts themselves have generally favoured a broad interpretation of the language of the Ninth Schedule, thus limiting the number of possible subjects not covered. The Ninth Schedule specifically lists the following matters as those that can only be legislated on by the states: land tenure, the Islamic religion, and local government. 

The 13 states are based on historical Malay Kingdoms, and 9 of the 13 states, known as the Malay States, retain their royal families. The Federal King (titled "Yang di-Pertuan Agong") is elected (de facto rotated) among the nine rulers to serve a 5-year term. The nine "Malay States" have a hereditary Ruler as titular Head of state and an executive Chief Minister or "Menteri Besar" as politically responsible Head of government. The rulers of Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Pahang, Perak, Selangor and Terengganu are styled Sultans (typically Islamic). Only Negeri Sembilan's elective ruler holds the rare, autochthonous Malay title of "Yang di-Pertuan Besar", whereas only the Ruler of Perlis is titled "Raja". Former British settlements and crown colonies of Penang and Malacca (both peninsular) and Sabah and Sarawak (both on Borneo) each have a federally appointed titular Governor (styled "Yang di-Pertua Negeri") and an executive Chief Minister or "Ketua Menteri".

Sabah and Sarawak have additional powers as part of the terms when they joined Malaysia, such as immigration controls. They have separate immigration policies and controls and a unique residency status. Passports are required even for Malaysians for travelling between these two states or between either state and Peninsular Malaysia, however Peninsular Malaysians who are on social/business visits up to three months are allowed to produce a MyKad or birth certificate and fill in a special form in lieu of a passport.

Each state has a unicameral legislature called "Dewan Undangan Negeri" ("DUN", State Assembly). Members of DUN are elected from single-member constituencies drawn based on the population. The state leader of the majority party in DUN is usually appointed Chief Minister by the Ruler or Governor. The term of DUN members is five years unless the assembly is dissolved earlier by the Ruler or Governor on the advise of the Chief Minister. Usually, DUN of the states in Peninsular Malaysia are dissolved in conjunction with the dissolution of the federal parliament, in order to have state elections running concurrently with the parliamentary election. However, Rulers and Governors hold discretionary powers in dissolving the DUN.Each state sends two representatives to the "Dewan Negara" (Senate), the upper house of the federal parliament.

The Parliament of Malaysia is permitted to legislate on issues of land, Islamic religion and local government in order to provide for a uniform law between different states, or on the request of the state assembly concerned. The law in question must also be passed by the state assembly as well, except in the case of certain land law-related subjects. Non-Islamic issues that fall under the purview of the state may also be legislated on at the federal level for the purpose of conforming with Malaysian treaty obligations. Each state is further divided into districts, which are then divided into mukim. In Sabah and Sarawak districts are grouped into "Divisions".

 was a Malaysian state from the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 until it separated from the Federation on 9 August 1965.

Works of Jagadguru Rambhadracharya

Jagadguru Ramanandacharya Swami Rambhadracharya (better-known as Jagadguru Rambhadracharya or Swami Rambhadracharya) is a Hindu "guru", Sanskrit scholar, writer, poet, play writer, composer, singer, philosopher and "Katha" artist. He is living in Chitrakoot, India. His works includes poems, plays, lectures, commentaries, religious speeches, and musical works of his works. He has written more than 90 works, including published books and unpublished hand written books, and four epic poems, a Hindi commentary on Tulsidas' Ramcharitmanas, a rhythmic Sanskrit commentary on the Ashtadhyayi, and Sanskrit commentaries on the Prasthanatrayi sacred books. Many of his audio and video recordings have been released. He writes in Sanskrit, Hindi, Awadhi, Maithili, and many other languages. He is blind.

"Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam" is his most famous work. He won many awards for it like the Sahitya Akademi Award for Sanskrit. He has also been given many other honors and titles as a writer and poet, like "Mahakavi" and "Kavikularatna".

His important literature works and musical works, grouped by their type, are listed below.











Rambhadracharya made Sanskrit commentaries named "Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam" on the Prasthanatrayi – Brahma Sutra, the Bhagavad Gita, and eleven Upanishads. These commentaries were released on 10 April 1998 by the then Prime Minister of India, Atal Behari Vajpayee. He made "Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam" on Narada Bhakti Sutra in 1991. Rambhadracharya then renewed—after five hundred years—the tradition of Sanskrit commentaries on the Prasthanatrayi. His commentary was also the second Sanskrit commentary on Prasthanatrayi of Ramananda Sampradaya, an the first was made by Ramananda himself and it was named "Ānandabhāṣyam". Rambhadracharya's commentary in Sanskrit on the Prasthanatrayi was the first written in almost 600 years.





Rambhadracharya's most controversial work was the critical edition of the Ramcharitmanas. It was published as the Tulsi Peeth edition. It was said that he changed the epic, but the dispute ended when Rambhadracharya said sorry for any problem caused by the publication. A writ was also filed against him but it was not accepted. This edition was published in 2005 by Shri Tulsi Peeth Seva Nyas.

Fermi paradox

Enrico Fermi's paradox wondered why, given the age and size of the universe and that there are billions of stars and planets that have existed for billions of years, we have not detected any other alien civilizations. There have been attempts to resolve the Fermi paradox by finding evidence of alien civilizations, along with thoughts that such life could exist without humans knowing.

The physicist Enrico Fermi first asked the question in an informal discussion in 1950. A paper by Michael H. Hart in 1975 started scientists to study the question in more detail. So some people call it the Fermi–Hart paradox. Other common names for the same phenomenon are "Fermi's question" ("Where are they?"), the "Fermi Problem", the "Great Silence", and "silentium universi" (Latin for "the silence of the universe"; the misspelling "silencium universi" is also common).

Hasekura Tsunenaga

The Roman Senate made Hasekura a citizen and a patrician of Rome. 

Hasekura was a retainer of Date Masamune. Date was the daimyo of Sendai.

Hasekura headed a diplomatic mission from Japan to the Vatican. The trip lasted seven years from 1613-1620, This historic journey is called the . Hasekura was the first Japanese ambassador in the Americas and in Europe. 

Hasekura traveled with a group across the Pacific Ocean to Mexico. They sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe. 

Hasekura returned to Japan by crossing Mexico from east to west in 1618. The Japanese sailed from Acapulco for the Philippines. From Manila, they sailed north to Japan in 1620. 

The story of Hasekura was unknown in Japan until the 19th century. This early diplomacy not included in official histories written in Japan in the 17th and 18th centuries. Information about this embassy 

Hasekura was a subject of interest in Europe. In 1615, Scipione Amati published a book about Haskeura's journey. In 1616, a book about the Japanese diplomats was published in French in Paris.
In 1873, Japanese diplomats traveled to Europe. They were surprised to learn about Hasekura. The diplomacy of Hasekura was forgotten because of the Sakoku policy of isolation. 

There are statues of Hasekura in Japan, Cuba, Spain, and Italy.

Many people in Coria del Río, Spain have the surname "Japón". These are descendants of the Japanese travelers.
A minor comet 11514 Tsunenaga was was named after Hasekura in 1991.

Spanish and Japanese archives have documents from the Hasekura mission. The letter carried by Hasekura to the King of Spain is in Seville, Spain. The paper proof of Haskura's Roman citizenship is in Sendai, Japan. These bits of history are proposed for UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme.

Mexican Revolution

The Mexican Revolution was brought on by a major armed struggle that started in 1910, among other factors, with an uprising led by Francisco I. Madero against longtime autocrat Porfirio Díaz. The Revolution was characterized by several socialist, liberal, anarchist, populist, and agrarianist movements. Over time the Revolution changed from a revolt against the established order to a multi-sided civil war. 

During that span, power was concentrated in the hands of a select few; the people had no power to express their opinions or select their public officials. Wealth was likewise concentrated in the hands of the few, and injustice was everywhere, in the cities and the countryside alike.

Tanning bed

A tanning bed is a device that emits ultraviolet radiation to give people a tan (make their skin darker). Like the sun, a tanning bed can also cause a sunburn if the person stays in too long. There are many kinds of tanning beds, but most look like the one in the photo.

Tanning beds became popular in Europe and America because of the work of Friedrich Wolff around 1979. He patented his design and charged others to use his ideas. His company, "Wolff Systems" does not build the tanning beds, they research and design for the tanning lamp. Some of the early adopters of the Wolff technology include ETS, Inc., SCA, Sun Industries, Inc., Montego Bay, Sunal. Later, Friedrich sold Wolff Systems to his brother Jorg Wolff, who was the founder of Cosmedico, Ltd., another pioneer in the tanning industry.

Tanning beds use a special fluorescent lamps (16 to 32 per tanning bed) that creates visible light and ultraviolet light. Like all fluorescent lights, they use a ballast system to limit the electricity going to each lamp, which is most often 100 watts per lamp. The tanning beds use a special acrylic, or clear shield over the lamps. Most clear plastics will block ultraviolet, but this special type of plastic lets most of the ultraviolet light pass through. Most tanning beds also have a cooling fan system, to cool the electronics inside the tanning bed and keep it from getting too hot. All tanning beds have a timer, a device to limit the amount of time the person is exposed to the ultraviolet light. After a few minutes, the timer makes the bed turn off.

Like the sun, tanning beds help your skin to produce vitamin D due to the exposure to the UV (ultraviolet light). Both the sun and tanning beds can damage your skin if you stay exposed for too long. Getting too much UV, or many sunburns can cause skin cancer, including melanoma, which can be deadly. There is a lot of controversy due to the risks. Most countries have many laws and rules that regulate tanning beds.

Barkly, Victoria

Barkly is a very small town in Victoria, Australia, about 180 kilometres northwest of Melbourne. It is located near the junction of the roads from Landsborough to Redbank, and from Frenchmans to St Arnaud. It is close to the western side of the St Arnaud Range National Park.

The area was first called the Navarre Diggings after gold was found in June 1859 by a group led by James Law (1827-1910). It was about six miles from the Navarre township. This caused a gold rush and there were soon about 700 people on the diggings. At the peak of the rush, there were over 6000 people in the area digging for gold.

James Law, who had come to Australia from Scotland, was given a reward of 150 pounds for being the first person to find gold. Other members of his group, John Fewster, W.R. Marshall and George Mill also were rewarded.

The name was changed to Barkly on 1 November 1861, after the Governor of Victoria, Sir Henry Barkly. The name was changed by the local gold warden, Mr. Warden Alley, a government official in charge of the diggings. A school was started, the Barkly Common School.

A cemetery, now called the Pioneer Cemetery, was begun close to the original diggings. The town of Barkly developed about two miles from this area, and a new cemetery was opened.

Barkly has a small Anglican church, a hall, and a few houses. The school has been closed and the buildings removed. There is a rose and lavender farm which is open to the public during the year. A headstone was placed on James Law's grave on 5 May, 1985. In 1996 a memorial stone was placed at the site of the first gold discovery.

Adam Scott, a settler, began construction of a sawmill and gristmill on the west shore of the Otonabee River and established the area as "Scott's Plains". In 1822, the British Parliament approved an experimental emigration plan which would transport poor Irish families to Upper Canada. The scheme was managed by Peter Robinson, who was at the time a politician in York (present-day Toronto). The area of Scott's Plains was re-named "Peterborough" in Robinson's honour. During 1850, Peterborough was incorporated as a town and grew to a population of 2,191. The town of Peterborough later grew into a city on July 1, 1905.

Bullet-proof glass

Bullet-proof glass, or bullet-resistant glass, is a type of strong, clear material that resists bullets. Complete protection against all weapons is not possible.

It is usually made from two or more types of material, one hard and one soft. The softer layer makes the glass more elastic, so it can flex (bend) instead of shatter. There must be a clear view through the glass. Bulletproof glass varies in thickness from three-quarters of an inch to three inches.

A popular method is stick a special plastic film to the the inner surface of ordinary glass. This 'security laminate' bonds to the glass with an adhesive. This gives a protection similar to the multi-layered bullet-resistant glass. Transparency is better, tint-free; thickness and weight is reduced as much as 50-70%. The laminate can be stuck on to existing windows; this a called a 'retrofit'.

The plastic provides little bullet-resistance. Glass, much harder than plastic, flattens the bullet. The plastic deforms, absorbing energy and (perhaps) stopping the bullet. The ability of the plastic layer to stop projectiles is directly proportional to its thickness. Bulletproof glass may be up to three inches thick.

All the parts of the glass must be transparent. The essential components are these:

The most usual method today requires three parts in layers:

A simpler version is used for car windshields. It consists of two panels of toughened glass, bonded together with polyvinyl butyal (PVB). The PVB stops cracks in the outer glass from spreading.

The idea is for guards inside to be able to shoot out, while attackers can't shoot in. One-way bulletproof glass is usually made of only two layers, a brittle layer on the outside and a flexible one on the inside. A bullet fired from the outside hits the brittle layer first, shattering an area of it. This absorbs some of the bullet's kinetic energy, and spreads it on a larger area. When the slowed bullet hits the flexible layer, it is stopped. 

However, when a bullet is fired from the inside, it hits the flexible layer first. The bullet penetrates the flexible layer because its energy is focused on a smaller area; the brittle layer then shatters outward due to the flexing of the inner layer and does not significantly hinder the bullet's progress. A problem with this idea is that a two-layer glass has limited stopping power.

There is a new type of transparent armour with aluminium oxynitride instead of glass. As the outside 'strike plate' layer, it is much lighter and performs better than traditional glass/polymer laminates. Aluminum oxynitride 'glass' can defeat .50 caliber armour-piercing rounds. Various types of other materials which closely resemble glass are also being developed.

Certain types of ceramic can also be used for "transparent" armour. They are denser and harder than traditional glass. These new types of transparent ceramic armours make thinner armour with equal stopping power to traditional laminated glass.

Frank Drake

Frank Donald Drake PhD is an American astronomer (a scientist who studies the universe and what is inside it) and astrophysicist (someone who studies the physics of astromony). He is most famous for joining in the first new SETI (Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence) experiment in 1960 and for making the Drake equation.

Born on the 28th of May 1930 in Chicago to Richard and Winifred Drake. As a young boy (in Chicago), Drake loved electronics and chemistry. He says that he thought of life on other planets but never said the idea with his family or teachers. 

He enrolled at Cornell University on a Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps scholarship. Once there, he began studying astronomy. A lecture from astrophysist Otto Struve in 1951 strengthen Drake's ideas about the possibility of extraterrestrial life. After college, he served briefly as an electronics officer on the USS Albany. He then went on to graduate school at Harvard in radio astronomy.

Drake's hobbies include lapidary and orchid cultivation.

Drake started his career undertaking radio astronomical research at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Green Bank, West Virginia, and for a short time in 1963 at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He conducted key measurements which revealed the presence of a Jovian ionosphere and magnetosphere.

In 1960, he started Project Ozma, which searches for extraterrestrial life. Drake is one of the pioneers of the modern field of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence with Giuseppe Cocconi, Philip Morrison, Iosif Shklovsky, and Carl Sagan. 

Drake joined the Astronomy faculty of Cornell University in 1963. Drake lead the conversion of the Arecibo Observatory to a radio astronomical facility. He lead Arecibo's improvements in 1974 and 1996. As a researcher, Drake was involved in the early work on pulsars. In this period, Drake was a professor at Cornell University and Director of the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC) – the formal name for the Arecibo facility. In 1974 he wrote the Arecibo message.

Drake co-designed the Pioneer plaque with Carl Sagan in 1972, the first physical message sent into space. The plaque was made to be read by clever alien life if they find it. He later helped the making of the Voyager Golden Record. He was elected to the AAAS in 1974.

Drake is a member of the National Academy of Sciences where he chaired the Board of Physics and Astronomy of the National Research Council (1989–92). He also served as President of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. He was a Professor of Astronomy at Cornell University (1964–84) and served as the Director of the Arecibo Observatory. He is currently involved in "The Carl Sagan Center for the Study of life in the universe".

He is Emeritus Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz where he also served as Dean of Natural Sciences (1984–88). He serves on the Board of Trustees of the SETI Institute.

Drake Planetarium at Norwood High School in Norwood, Ohio is named for Dr. Drake and linked to NASA.

Political status of Jammu and Kashmir

The political status of Kashmir region is the subject of a long-running political dispute between Pakistan and the Republic of India since 1947. On October 20, 1947, tribesmen backed by Pakistan invaded Kashmir. The Maharaja of Jammu & Kashmir initially fought back but on 27 October appealed for assistance to the Governor-General Louis Mountbatten, who agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India. Once the papers of accession to India were signed, Indian soldiers entered Kashmir with orders to stop any further occupation, but they were not allowed to expel anyone from the state. India took the matter to the United Nations. The UN resolution asked Pakistan to vacate the areas it has occupied and asked India to assist the U.N. Plebiscite Commission to organize a plebiscite to determine the will of the people. Pakistan refused to vacate the occupied areas.

Today Kashmir is split, as follows:

The status quo: 
Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for more than 60 years. Currently a boundary - the Line of Control - divides the region in two, with one part military occupied by India and one administered by Pakistan. India would like to formalise this status quo and make it the accepted international boundary. But Pakistan and Kashmiri activists reject this plan because they both want greater control over the region.

In 1947-8 India and Pakistan fought their first war over Jammu and Kashmir. Under United Nations' supervision, they agreed to a ceasefire along a line which left one-third of the state - comprising what Pakistan calls Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and the Northern Areas administered by Pakistan and two-thirds, Jammu, Ladakh and the Kashmir Valley, controlled by India. 

In 1972, under the terms of the Simla agreement, the ceasefire line was renamed the Line of Control. 

Although India claims that the entire state is part of India, it has been prepared to accept the Line of Control as the international border, with some possible modifications. Both the US and the UK have also favoured turning the Line of Control into an internationally-recognised frontier. 

But Pakistan has consistently refused to accept the Line of Control as the border since the predominantly Muslim Kashmir Valley would remain as part of India. Formalising the status quo also does not take account of the aspirations of those Kashmiris who have been fighting since 1989 for independence for the whole or part of the state.

Cape Mendocino is a geographic feature of the northern Californian coastline. It is the westernmost point of the coast of California in Humbolt County. 

The cape was named in the 1540s. The name honors Antonio de Mendoza. He was the Viceroy of New Spain.

This It has been known as a landmark since the 16th century. Spanish ships crossed the Pacific Ocean by following the Pacific trade winds. The North Equatorial Current brought them to the North American coastline. After landfall, the Manila galleons would sail down the coast to Acapulco in Mexico.

Francis Drake sighted Cape Mendocino in 1576. 

Hasekura Tsunenaga's sailed from Japan to Cape Mendocino in 1613. Hasekura was on a diplomatic mission. He was traveling to the courts of Philip II of Spain and Pope Paul V.

The Cape Mendocino region is an active earthquake zone. In April 1992, three big earthquakes were centered near the cape.

The Mendocino Triple Junction is to the west of Cape Mendocino under the Pacific Ocean. It is a geologic triple junction where three tectonic plates come together. The San Andreas Fault, a transform boundary, runs south from the junction, separating the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. To the north is the Cascadia subduction zone, where the Gorda Plate is being subducted under the edge of the North American plate. Running west from the triple junction is the Mendocino Fracture Zone, the transform boundary between the Gorda Plate and the Pacific Plate.

Indo-Pakistani War of 1971

The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 was a military conflict between India and Pakistan. Lasting just 13 days it is considered one of the shortest wars in history.

During the war, Indian and Pakistani forces fought on the eastern and western fronts. The war effectively came to an end after the Eastern Command of the Pakistani Armed Forces signed the Instrument of Surrender (1971) on December 16, 1971. After the surrender, East Pakistan seceded as the independent state of Bangladesh. Around 97,368 West Pakistanis who were in East Pakistan at the time of its independence, including some 79,700 Pakistan Army soldiers and paramilitary personnel and 12,500 civilians, were taken as prisoners of war by India.
The Soviet Union sided with the Bangladeshis, and supported the Indian Army and Mukti Bahini during the war. The Soviets thought that the independence of Bangladesh would weaken the position of its rivals—the United States and China. The USSR gave assurances to India that if a confrontation with the United States or China developed, it would take counter-measures. This assurance was enshrined in the Indo-Soviet friendship treaty signed in August 1971.

The United States supported Pakistan politically and with supplies. President Richard Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger feared Soviet expansion into South and Southeast Asia. Pakistan was a close ally of the People's Republic of China, with whom Nixon had been negotiating a "rapprochement". Nixon was planning to visit China in February 1972. Nixon feared that an Indian invasion of West Pakistan would give the Soviets control over the region. It would seriously undermine the global position of the United States and the regional position of America's new tacit ally, China. In order to demonstrate to China the "bona fides" of the United States as an ally, Nixon sent military supplies to Pakistan, routing them through Jordan and Iran, while also encouraging China to increase its arms supplies to Pakistan. The Nixon administration also ignored reports it received of the "genocidal" activities of the Pakistani Army in East Pakistan, most notably the Blood telegram. This prompted widespread criticism and condemnation both by Congress and in the international press.
The United States introduced a resolution in the UN Security Council calling for a cease-fire and the withdrawal of armed forces by India and Pakistan. It was vetoed by the Soviet Union. In the following days Nixon and Kissinger tried to get India to withdraw, but they did not succeed.

President Nixon requested Iran and Jordan to send their F-86, F-104 and F-5 fighter jets in aid of Pakistan. 

When Pakistan's defeat in the eastern sector seemed certain, Nixon deployed a carrier battle group led by the aircraft carrier USS "Enterprise" into the Bay of Bengal. The "Enterprise" and its escort ships arrived on station on 11 December 1971. According to a Russian documentary, the United Kingdom deployed a carrier battle group led by the aircraft carrier HMS "Eagle" to the Bay.

On 6 December and 13 December, the Soviet Navy dispatched two groups of cruisers and destroyers and a submarine armed with nuclear missiles from Vladivostok; they trailed U.S. Task Force 74 into the Indian Ocean from 18 December 1971 until 7 January 1972. The Soviets also had a nuclear submarine to help ward off the threat posed by USS "Enterprise" task force in the Indian Ocean.

The AVR microcontroller architecture was developed by Atmel in 1996. It is based on the Harvard microcontroller architecture. The AVR was one of the first microcontroller families to use on-chip flash memory for program storage, as opposed to one-time programmable ROM, EPROM, or EEPROM used by other microcontrollers at the time.

Many people think that AVR stands for Alf (Egil Bogen) and Vegard (Wollan)'s Risc processor".

This architecture replaces older MCS-51 architecture. One machine cycle of MCS-51 takes 12 clock cycles and most of instructions are executed in one machine cycle.

AVR microcontrollers (MCUs) can execute most of instructions in single machine cycle too, but one machine cycle takes only one clock cycle. Performance per clock cycle is 12 times higher with AVR.

The core has 32 general purpose registers directly connected to ALU. It allowing two independent
registers to be accessed and instruction with them executed in one machine cycle.

Senedd

The Senedd () also known as the National Assembly building, houses the debating chamber and three committee rooms for the National Assembly for Wales in Cardiff. The 5,308 square meters (57,100 sq ft) Senedd building was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 1 March 2006 and the total cost was £69.6 million, which included £49.7M in construction costs. The Senedd is part of the National Assembly estate that includes Tŷ Hywel and the Pierhead Building. 

After two selection processes, the decision was taken that the debating chamber would be on a new site, called Site 1E, at Capital Waterside in Cardiff Bay. The Pritzker Prize-winning architect Richard Rogers won the international competition to design the building. It was designed to be sustainable with use of renewable technologies and be energy efficient. The building was awarded an "Excellent" certification by the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), the highest ever awarded in Wales, and was nominated for the 2006 Stirling Prize. 

The Senedd was constructed in two phases, the first in 2001 and the second from August 2003 until it was handed over to the National Assembly in February 2006. Between phases, the National Assembly changed contractors and the project's management structure, but retained Rogers as the scheme architect. The building was nearly six times over budget and four years and 10 months late, compared to the original estimates of the project in 1997. Total costs rose due to unforeseen security measures after the September 11 attacks, and because the National Assembly did not have an independent cost appraisal of the project until December 2000, three years after the original estimate. Phase 2 costs rose by less than 6% over budget, and that phase was six months late, due to information and communication technology (ICT) problems.

Harley-Davidson, or H-D for short, is an American motorcycle maker that started making motorcycles near Milwaukee in 1903. The company makes heavyweight motorcycles that are designed for cruising on the highway; they're called Harleys. Harley-Davidson is one of two big U.S. companies that made motorcycles that was still in business after the Great Depression; the other closed down in 1953.

Harleys have a special look and sound. Most new Harleys, except the V-Rods, are made to look like old Harleys. Harley-Davidson made small motorcycles in the US and in Italy, but they didn't sell well enough. They stopped making small motorcycles in the US in 1966 and in Italy in 1978.

Harley-Davidson and their motorcycles have many fans. The fans can join clubs and go to events or to Harley-Davidson's museum. Apart from selling motorcycles, Harley-Davidson also charges fees for companies to put Harley-Davidson's logos on the things they make. Less than one-hundredth of the money Harley-Davidson made in 2010 came from these fees.

Ultralight material

Ultralight materials are very light substances. They include silica aerogels, carbon nanotube aerogels, metallic foams, polymeric foams, and metallic microlattices. The density of air is about 1.275 mg/cm, which means that the air in the pores greatly lowers the density of the material.

The lightest material ever made was invented in 2011. It is made out of a microscopic micro-lattice of hollow tubes – a criss-cross diagonal pattern with open spaces between the tubes. The researchers say the material is 100 times lighter than Styrofoam and is very strong. The material is low density: it has a density of 0.9 milligrams per cubic centimetre. Silica aerogels, the world's lightest "solid" materials, are only as low as 1.0 mg per cubic cm. The metallic micro-lattices are 99.99% air and only 0.01% solid. The metal used is nickel.

The material is not just light: it has some elastic properties. When it is squashed, the little tubes are also squashed, but when the pressure is removed, they rebound. A sample squashed to half its height rebounds 98% when the pressure is lifted. That makes the material similar in some ways to elastomers: they are materials used to cushion against shock.

The word VENONA is in capital letters (VENONA) although in many writings it it seen as lowercase letters (Venona). VENONA was made to spy on Soviet government communications. The Venona project was most famous for the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg case known as LIBERAL. 

In July 1995, the first six public releases were shown which also had 49 messages about the Soviets trying to get information on the United States atomic bomb and the Manhattan Project. In the next five more years, about 3,000 VENONA messages were made public.

The MSL will try to do the first-ever precision landing on Mars. It is expected to land on Mars at Gale Crater on August 5, 2012. The rover "Curiosity" will help to see if anything can live on Mars. It will see whether Mars has, or ever had, an environment able to support microbial life. It will also carefully look at samples scooped up from the soil and drilled powders from rocks.

"Curiosity" will be five times as heavy as the Mars Exploration Rovers "Spirit" or "Opportunity". "Curiosity" will carry more than ten times the mass of scientific instruments than "Spirit" or "Opportunity". It will be launched by an Atlas V 541 rocket. "Curiosity" will be expected to work for at least 1 Martian year (668 Martian sols/686 Earth days). It will explore Mars with greater range than any other rover.

Mars Science Laboratory mission is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program. The program is a long-term mission of robotic exploration of Mars. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology manages the program for NASA. The total cost of the MSL project is about US$2.3 billion.

Mayfair (first called The May Fair) is an area in central London. It is in the city of Westminster.

Mayfair is named after the annual fortnight-long "May Fair" that happened in a place that is Shepherd Market today (from 1686 until it was banned at that place in 1764). Until 1686, the May Fair was held in Haymarket, and after 1764, it moved to Fair Field in Bow.

Mayfair was bordered by Hyde Park to the west, Oxford Street to the north, Piccadilly to the south and Bond Street to the east, although the eastern boundary has been made longer recently, so now it goes all the way to to Regent Street. Most of the area was first made between the mid 17th century and the mid 18th century.

The district is mostly commercial now. It has many offices in houses and new buildings. The price of rents in Mayfair are some of the highest in London and the world. There is still a large amount of houses as well as some exclusive shopping and London's largest amount of luxury hotels and many restaurants. Some buildings in Mayfair are:

The City of Westminster uses the Mayfair Library as a local library.

St. Nicholas College of London has lessons in English and other languages for people who live in and visit Mayfair.

If more than two people share the symptoms or delusions, people speak about"folie a trois" (3), "folie à quatre" (4), "folie à plusieurs", or "folie en famille". Officially, the condition is known as induced delusional disorder or shared psychotic disorder today, but many publications still use the original terms, which were developed in France in the 19th century.
Today, there are two main forms of the condition:

<doc id="315385" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=315385" title="SnRNP">
SnRNP

snRNP, or 'snurps', join with proteins to form spliceosomes. The spiceosomes govern alternative splicing.

The background to this is that, in eukaryotes, most genes code for a protein in separated strings of DNA. This is because, of a total gene, coding bits (exons) are separated by non-coding bits (introns). The process called alternative splicing can produce many possible proteins from the gene parts because the proteins are put together in different ways. Alternative splicing produces alternative messenger RNAs, and these produce different proteins. Spliceosomes control the details of the splicing.

The two essential components of snRNPs are protein molecules and RNA. The RNA found within each snRNP particle is known as small nuclear RNA, or snRNA, and is usually about 150 nucleotides in length. The snRNA component of the snurp is specific to individual introns because it 'recognises' the sequences of critical signals at the ends and branch sites of introns. The snRNA in snurps is similar to ribosomal RNA: it acts both as an enzyme (catalyst) and builds structure.

SnRNPs were discovered by Michael Lerner and Joan Steitz.
Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman also played a role in the discovery, winning the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1989 for their independent discoveries that RNA can act as a catalyst in cell development.

<doc id="315459" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=315459" title="Halkett boat">
Halkett boat

A Halkett boat is a type of lightweight inflatable boat. The boat was first created by (1820–1885) during the 1840s. Halkett had been interested in the problems of travelling in the Canadian Arctic. He wanted to make a boat that was light enough to be carried over bad terrain, but strong enough to be used in very bad weather conditions.

Halkett's first design was a boat that was made using cloth combined with rubber. This boat could be filled with air (inflated) to float on water or the air could be removed (deflated) so it would be smaller and lighter to carry. When deflated, the hull of the boat could be worn as a cloak. The oar used as a walking stick and the sail could be used as an umbrella. Next, he created a two-man boat that was small enough to fit into a knapsack. When it was deflated, It could be used as a waterproof blanket.

Many people who explored Canada liked his ideas but they were not very useful to most other people. He tried to show the Royal Navy that the boats could be useful to them but did not succeed. He also could not sell them fishermen and people that hunted duck. They were commercially unsuccessful. Only two Halkett boats are still known to exist. One belonged to Orcadian explorer John Rae. The other is in the Hudson's Bay Company Museum Collection at the Manitoba Museum.

Peter Halkett was a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy in the 1840s. He was the son of John Halkett, a director of the Hudson's Bay Company who had lived in Canada for many years before returning to England. Peter Halkett was interested in the exploration of the Canadian Arctic for a long time. He was very interested in John Franklin's Coppermine Expedition of 1819–1822. This expedition had many problems. 
Franklin explored the northern coast of Canada for three years. He was looking for the Northwest Passage. His search ended very badly. It was said that people killed other members of the expedition and that some even ate the other people. 11 of the 20 members of the group were killed. The people that were not killed had to eat lichen, their own boots, and the remains of dead animals left by wolves. They had become stranded on the wrong side of the Coppermine River after their boats had been destroyed in a storm. John Richardson tried to swim to safety. This caused him very bad hypothermia. One person in the party built a small canoe from canvas and willow. They had to cross the river one at a time using the canoe.

Halkett was an amateur inventor. During his spare time while in the navy, he worked on building a boat that would be small and light enough to be carried through wilderness, but strong enough to carry people in safety across wide bodies of water. He chose to build a boat in which all parts could also be used as clothing or items that the user would normally carry with them.

Halkett made a waterproof cloak. It was created from an early form of Macintosh cloth. This cloth was made of cotton combined with India rubber. The inside of the cloak was an airtight and watertight inflatable ovoid. It was made of four different airtight sections. If one section was damaged and could not hold air, the others would still keep the boat floating. The cloak had a pocket that held a paddle blade and a small bellows. The person wearing the cloak would carry a walking stick. This stick was also used as the handle for the paddle. There was also a large umbrella which was used as a sail for the boat. The cloak weighed about . . It took three to four minutes to inflate the boat. Once the boat was inflated, it could carry six to eight people.

In early 1844, Halkett tested the first boat-cloak on the River Thames. He paddled it without taking on any water.<ref name="Pain42" / His test went very well. Because of this, he took the boat-cloak with him while on naval service. He used it whenever he could to test it under many different sea conditions. In November 1844, Halkett wanted to test the boat-cloak in bad weather conditions. The seas of the Bay of Biscay were usually very bad, but the weather was unusually calm when he got there. The boat-cloak was very well liked by explorers. John Richardson (who had almost died during the 1819–1822 Coppermine expedition) wrote that "Had we been possessed of such a contrivance in our first expedition, I have little doubt of our having brought the whole party in safely".

Because of how well the boat-cloak did during his tests, Halkett built a larger version. This boat could be folted into a knapsack. When inflated, it could carry two men. Each man would use a paddle on each side of the boat. When deflated, the boat could be used as a waterproof blanket. This would allow the users to sleep on wet ground. The people in charge of the Royal Navy though the boat could be useful to some people but was not likely to be useful to the Navy. On 8 May 1845 Lord Herbert, First Secretary to the Admiralty wrote to Halkett that "My Lords are of an opinion that your invention is extremely clever and ingenious, and that it might be useful in Exploring and Surveying Expeditions, but they do not consider that it would be made applicable for general purposes in the Naval Service".
Although the Navy saw no use for Halkett's boats in general naval service, this larger boat was liked very much by explorers. John Franklin bought one to take on the 1845 expedition. This expedition ended badly. All 129 men and their two ships wee lost and never found. Franklin believed that Halkett boats were very needed to travel in Canada. He gave the boat that was to be used for his expedition to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land so that Simpson could use in his travels in the region. He got another boat from Halkett to be used on his last expedition.

Orkneyman John Rae, known by the Inuit as (, "He who takes long strides"), was a Hudson's Bay Company surgeon. He became a surveyor of the Canadian Arctic. Unlike most Europeans of that time, Rae believed that the local people knew the best ways to deal with the very bad weather conditions. He travelled Inuit-style, using sledges and snowshoes. He slept in snow igloos. Rae took a Halkett boat on his first expedition in 1846. He said that it was "most useful in crossing and recrossing the river at Repulse Bay". He also said that "although in constant use for upwards of six weeks on a rocky coast it never required the slightest repair" and "ought to form part of the equipment of every expedition".

In 188, the Royal navy sent out people to find out what had become of the ships and men of Franklin's expedition. The search party was led by John Richardson and John Rae. They were equipped with a Halkett boat bought by the government. The party did not find Franklin, but they learned that the Halkett boat very useful. During the search, they used the single boat to move their entire party across a river in 14 trips. Rae said that that although the rubber of the boat became stiff from the cold, it was not hard to warm it to soften the material when needed. Halkett boats were also taken on 6 other expedition that were sent to look for Franklin. During these they were used for fishing.

In 1851 French explorer Joseph René Bellot led another expedition to find Franklin. This was paid for by Franklin's wife. Bellot took a Halkett boat-cloak on the journey. He said that it was "of immense value in a country where the want of wood renders it impossible to form any sort of raft". Bellot's expedition did not find Franklin. It was not until 1853 that an expedition led by Rae (using with "two beautiful Halkett boats") found a group of Inuit who told them that they saw men dragging a boat four years earlier. Their bodies were found soon after that.

Even though the boats were said to be very good for lake-fishing and duck-shooting and were shown in the Great Exhibition of 1851, they did not sell well. Halkett's boat were not widely used except in the field of Canadian exploration. Halkett died on 23 March 1885, aged 65, and the building of his boats stopped. John Rae gave his boat from the 1853 expedition to a Miss Peace of Kirkwall. Many years later it was found and is now in the Stromness Museum at Orkney. A second boat is in the Hudson's Bay Company Museum Collection at the Manitoba Museum.

Mackenzie Large Igneous Province

The Mackenzie Large Igneous Province (MLIP) is a major Mesoproterozoic large igneous province of the southwestern, western and northwestern Canada. It consists of a group of related igneous rocks that were formed during a massive igneous event starting about 1,270 million years ago. The large igneous province extends from the Arctic in Nunavut to near the Great Lakes in northwestern Ontario.

It is an extremely large area of related igneous rocks that were spewed out in a short time, geologically speaking. The Mackenzie Large Igneous Province was caused by processes other than normal plate tectonics and seafloor spreading. MLIP is also one of the largest Proterozoic magmatic provinces on Earth, as well as the world's largest and best-preserved continental flood basalt terrain. Igneous rocks of the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province are generally mafic in composition, including basalt and gabbro.

The Mackenzie Large Igneous Province is much larger than other large igneous province. The standard size classification for large igneous provinces is a minimum extent of . However, the Mackenzie dike swarm itself occupies an area of at least , making the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province larger than the Ontong Java Plateau in the southwestern Pacific Ocean and the U.S. state of Alaska.

<doc id="315522" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=315522" title="Giorgio Orsini">
Giorgio Orsini

Giorgio Orsini (referred often as Giorgio da Sebenico, Giorgio di Matteo, born 1410, died 1475) was an Italian medieval sculptor and architect from Dalmatia. Orsini lived and worked mainly in the city of Sebenico (modern-day Šibenik, Croatia), Republic of Venice.

Giorgio Orsini descends from ancient and noble House of Orsini. Hard times had been fallen upon the House branch Giorgio belonged to. Mateo, Giorgio's father, as much as Giorgio himself, has forced to support himself and his family by manual labor. As the architect and sculptor, he was educated in the art workshop of sculptors Giovanni and Bartolomeo Buon in Venice. While in Venice, Giorgio married Elizabetta da Monte, who brought him a fair dowry, money and homes in Venice. He invested Elizabetta's money in a grocery store and in a merchant ship which brought them good returns. Elizabetta's husband entrusted her of a power of attorney by which she was able to attend to his affairs while he was absent. In July 1455 Giorgio bought home from a local nobleman Simeonich, where he engraved his family's heraldic symbol - a bear. When signing contracts, Giorgio often used his art name Georgius Dalmaticus, Sixty five years after his death, his grandson, Giacomo, an advocate by vocation, was recognized as a descendant of the noble House of Orsini. Giorgio's and Elizabetta's daughter Flavia married another Dalmatian painter, Giorgio Culinovich (Schiavone) in the year of 1463. Other source claims that the Orsinis' daughter's name was Elena (who married Schiavone).

From Venice, in in the year of 1441, Giorgio was invited to Sebenico to replace Messer Antonio di Pietro Paolo who had fallen into disrepute with the building committee of the cathedral of Sebenico. Antonio commenced the Cathedral building in 1431. Giorgio abandoned the Gothic style based ideas of his predecessor and followed revolutionary ideas of Italian Renaissance architecture, The whole cathedral building is roofed with wagon vaults, made of huge slabs of marble supported on strong transverse ribs, the same stone covering forming the ceiling inside and the roof outside. He was the chief cathedral architect from 1441 to 1473. From July 1, 1477 the work was continued by another architect, Niccolò di Giovanni da Firenze. In 1444 Giorgio went to Spalato to build the chapel of S. Ranier in the church of S. Benedetto. The work was finished in two years. He came back to Spalato in 1448 to make the chapel of S. Anastasius in the cathedral.

Orsini did not follow always the Renaissance. There are also several fine late Ancona Gothic buildings, among them the facade of S. Francesco and S. Agostino churches, the build of Palazzo Benincasa, all done by Giorgio Orsini. Work on S. Agostino facade was finished in 1455. On the S. Agostino facade, Orsini worked between 1455 and 1459. On the Loggia dei Mercanti, which was built by Giovanni Pace in 1443, the facade, with statues representing the virtues, is the work of Giorgio Orsini (1451-9)In 1460, Giorgio returned to Sebenico. In 1464 and 1465 he was at Ragusa, where he helped in building the Torre Menze, and in restoring the palace of the Rectors. The Palace of Rectors was badly damaged by the 1462 earthquake. Orsini replaced the tree central capitals, who were damaged beyond repair, of that building. The next year he was at Pago (today Pag, Croatia), improving and enlarging the courtyard of the bishop's palace. The design and work on facade of the cathedral at Ossero belongs to him, too. In the next year he undertook work on the facade of the Cappella Grande of the parish church at Pago. In 1470 he went to Rome, where his compatriot Giovanni Dalmato, the sculptor, of Trau (today Trogir, Croatia), was at work on the monument of Paul II. In 1472 he commenced the facade of S. Maria, Cittanova, in the Marche.

He had many pupils, some of whom continued to work on the cathedral at Sebenico after his death in 1475.

In Croatia, Giorgio Orsini is celebrated as a Croatian sculptor and architect, known under the Croatian name "Juraj Dalmatinac". This name is translation of his art name "Georgius Dalmaticus". The translation is coming from the second half of 19th century. Another version of the Orsini's croatised name is "Juraj Matejević". This name comes as translation of the "Georgvs Mathei" (Georg, Mathew's son) text engraved in the marble of St. Jacob cathedral church in Sebenico. Croatian author Fisković claims that "Orsini", as his family name, was never used by the artist and it was adopted by his son, after the death of his father. His claim is not supported by any documents or records dated back to the times Orsini lived and worked. Fisković's claim is defeated by the home sale contract where Giorgio Orsini was named as the home buyer. Two Italian authors recorded the use of Giorgio's family name by his son Mateo and grandson Giovanni and refuted Fiskovic
Croats erected a monument celebrating Orsini in the front of St. Jacob cathedral church in Šibenik, Croatia. This monument, an over-sized standing statue of Orsini, is a work of Yugoslav sculptor Ivan Meštrović. Two elementary schools in Croatia bear that name: one in Pag, and one in Šibenik.

Gabbro

Gabbro is a large group of dark, coarse-grained, igneous rocks. They are chemically equivalent to basalt. The rocks are plutonic, formed when molten magma is trapped under the Earth's surface and cools into a crystalline mass. 

Most of the Earth's surface has gabbro in the oceanic crust, produced by basalt magmatism at mid-ocean ridges. In general, when the gabbro is formed, it lies above the Earth's mantle, and below the basalt.

Gabbro is generally coarse grained, with crystals in the size range of 1 mm or greater. It is is an essential part of the oceanic crust. Long belts of gabbro intrusions are typically formed at proto-rift zones and around ancient rift zone margins.

Facies is a term in geology. It is a distinctive rock type or unit which forms under certain conditions. These conditions reflect the process of sedimentation. This may be caused by a particular process or environment. For example, in the Milankovich cycle, the climate changes regularly. As it does so, the seas may shrink and expand on a regular basis. At a particular place, deeper water carbonates may alternate with shallow-water shales and silts. These "facies" are seen in the column of rocks.

Defense of the Ancients

Defense of the Ancients (often called DotA) is an unofficial map of the game and the expansion pack . It is not technically supported by Blizzard Entertainment. This is a team strategy game that is intended mainly for teams of three against three or five against five. More rarely it is for teams of two or one on one.

Since its original release, "DotA" has become a feature at several worldwide tournaments, including Blizzard Entertainment's BlizzCon and the Asian World Cyber Games, as well as the Cyberathlete Amateur and CyberEvolution leagues; Gamasutra declared that "DotA" was perhaps the most popular "free, non-supported game mod in the world". Valve Corporation is currently developing a sequel, "Dota 2".

The main task of the players is to enter the enemy team's base, and destroy the main building called "Ancient". Every 30 seconds the main buildings spawn minions that automatically go and attack all enemy units in their way. With their help you can push the enemy base and kill enemy heroes faster. Towers and other structures protect this building. Players must destroy these first because until then, the main building is "invulnerable." The team who destroys the opposing team's building automatically wins. The player controls a hero with whom they advance to the opponent's base. Your hero becomes more powerful with time, you must gather experience and gold because then you are abbe to buy powerful items. The forces of both sides are the same, except for differences in the ability of players. You can choose from over hundred different characters with different abilities. Heroes are divided to a several classes 

The map is balanced and axially symmetrical.

Ahmed Rushdi, (; April 24, 1934 – April 11, 1983) was a legendary Pakistani playback singer. He was "an important contributor to the "Golden age" of Pakistani film music." Rushdi is acclaimed as one of the greatest singers ever lived in south asia. He is considered to be one of the most famous and versatile singers of the subcontinent. He is also considered to be the first regular pop singer of south asia and credited as having sung the "first-ever South asian" pop song.In 1954, he recorded the official National anthem of Pakistan with several other singers. Rushdi has recorded the highest number of film songs in the history of "Pakistani cinema" in many languages. He suffered from poor health during the latter part of his life and died of a heart attack at the age of 48, after recording approximately five thousand film songs for 583 released films. Besides popular music, Rushdi also helped popularize the ghazals of Naseer Turabi.In 2003, 20 years after his death, Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf awarded him the "Sitara-e-Imtiaz".
Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained singers, although Rushdi never had any influences from any classical singer. He is famously known as "Magician of voice" and his popularity also turned traditional classical singers against him but did not effect his fame and his death is termed as irreparable loss to the industry. Actor "Waheed Murad" declared Rushdi's song, "Bhooli hui hoon daastan", his favorite song. Music directors like M.Ashraf and Nisar Bazmi also hold centaury partnerships with Ahmed Rushdi and they have composed hundreds of songs for him. According to complete songography, M.Ashraf composed 734 songs in 211 films for Rushdi but available figures indicate a composition of 132 songs in 100 films for him. The first film of this pair was "Speran" in 1961 and the last was "Hero" in 1983. Ahmed Rushdi influenced many singers in music industry.
Since 1976, Ahmed Rushdi was a heart patient and his doctors advised him to abstain from singing but Rushdi refused by saying that music was his life. When he had a second heart attack in 1981, he was composing a musical album in the voice of singer "Mujeeb Aalam". On the night of April 11, 1983, he had a third heart attack. He was immediately taken to the hospital but pronounced dead by the doctors. He was 48. Rushdi was buried at Sakhi Hassan Graveyard, Karachi. His last non film song was "Aaney walo suno" which was a duet with "Mehnaz".

Floorball

Floorball is an indoor team sport similar to hockey. Floorball is usually played in gyms with little plastic balls and special hockey sticks. In floorball, there are basically five players with sticks and a goalkeeper without any special equipment. The goalkeeper has only special jersey and helmet. Floorball is very popular today and in 2020 it is going to be part of the Summer Olympic Games.

Floorball was invited in the USA, but has been most popular in Sweden since the 1970s. Its popularity quickly spread to Finland and Switzerland, but with different rules. For example, in Switzerland a goalkeeper is allowed to use a stick. In 1986, the International Floorball Federation (IFF) was founded and rules became the same. 

Floorball is played in a gym on an area of 40x20 meters bordered by boards 50 centimetres high. The formations are very similar to ice hockey. Both teams play with 3 attackers, 2 defenders and a goalkeeper. They can relieve whenever they want. Floorball is played 3x20 minutes with 15 minutes breaks. This is only for men. In juniors matches the time is different. Floorball is a contact sport so players can play with their body, but it has limits. The only thing they can give a goalkeeper is a stick, but they can handle the ball with the body. They cannot hit the ball with their hands or head and they cannot jump. The goalkeeper can hit the ball with every part of his body and he can it for 3 seconds. In floorball, a player can be excluded for 2 minutes when he breaks the rules.

The most redistricted players have in Sweden. The second is Finland and the third is Czech Republic.

IFF organises world championships in floorball. Every year they are in a different country.

Gaslighting

Gaslighting is a type of psychological abuse where somebody uses lies or tricks to make another person doubt their memory and mental health. Gaslighting can be anything from an abusive person insisting that the abuse never happened, to setting up strange incidents to confuse the victim.

The word "gaslighting" comes from the play by Patrick Hamilton, "Gaslight" (1938), and its movie adaptations. In those works a character uses many tricks, including turning the gas lamps lower than normal, to convince his spouse that she is crazy. Since then, the phrase has become a common expression which has also been used in clinical and research literature.

Graphics tablet

A graphics tablet is a computer input device which replace hand-drawing. User can draw directly to computer like if he was drawing on a paper or any other material. These tablets are also used to subscribe some documents or in East Asia to capture local handwriting. 

Another thing that tablets can do is digitizing. It´s process which trace an image from piece of paper.

Tablet itself consist flat surface on which can user draw. This surface has many size or shapes. Images drawn on tablet are not shown on surface itself but they appears on the monitor. However there are screen hybrids which allow user to see drawing right on the drawing surface. These hybrids are combination of an ordinary tablet and touch screen (unlike touch screen, they offer pressure sensitivity and higher resolution).

Stylus is a pen-like device (often powered by battery) that allow transmitting user action to the tablet. It detect different degrees of pressure, e.g. for use in a drawing program to differentiate line thickness or color density. 
After stylus, pucks are the most commonly used tablet accessory. A puck is a mouse-like device that can detect its absolute position and rotation. Professional pucks often have loupe for greater precision

These make use of electromagnetic induction technology. The tablet generates an electromagnetic signal, which is received by the circuit in the stylus. The wires in the tablet then change to a receiving mode and read the signal generated by the stylus.
Stylus use self-powered electronics that generate and transmit a signal to the tablet. Tablets may listen for pen signals constantly, so it eliminate inaccuracy of transmission.
Optical tablets operate by a very small digital camera in the stylus.
These were early models. A small sound generator was mounted in the stylus, and the acoustic signal picked up by two microphones placed near the writing surface.
Electromagnetic tablets work by generating and detecting an electromagnetic signal.
Since stylus can sense a pressure, tilts and other attributes, its great for computer graphic usage (especially two dimensional). These attributes can make differences between brush size, opacity, shape, color, etc. in certain graphic programs. 

Graphics tablets are very welcome in the artistic world and also for technical drawing and Computer-aided design.

They are also used for online teaching, e. g. live tutorials or lessons where visual information is needed.

Patrick Murphy (giant)

Patrick Murphy (1834–1862) was an Irish giant, born in County Down from parents James Murphy and mother Peggy (nee Cunningham), who put himself in a show as a way of making money. He originally worked on the docks in Liverpool, England and, after that, became a waiter at a hotel. Because he was so tall, Murphy attracted crowds everywhere he went. He eventually decided that he could make a living being tall. He had always told of himself as being 8'10" and in some circles as much as 9'3". In about 1860, he was measured by Dr. Virchow as being 7'3.4" (222 cm) tall.

In May 1857 the Emperor and Empress of Austria invited the tall Irishman to visit their kingdom. While he was on tour throughout Europe, he died of smallpox in Marseille at the age of twenty-eight.

Patrick Murphy (pilot)

Patrick Murphy was an Irish pilot who mistakenly bombed the border town of Naco, Arizona. Not much is known of his personal life. 

Murphy owned a plane around the time of the Cristero War in Mexico against the anti-Catholic government of Emilio Portes Gil. Murphy decided to help the rebels by using his plane to bomb the government-controlled town of Naco, Sonora. He tried many times between March 31 and April 6 to bomb Naco but also accidentally, bombed the Arizona border town with the same name. He destroyed some buildings and a car. United States soldiers eventually came to his house and took away his plane. Murphy escaped to rebel territory in Mexico but returned to the United States and was jailed for a little while.

Murphy became the first person working for another country to ever bomb the mainland United States. Singer Dolan Ellis honored Murphy in one of his songs on his "Tall Tales, Lost Trails & Heroes" album.

Xiangsheng

Xiangsheng (Chinese: 相聲 or 相声) is a traditional Chinese comedy form. The term is sometimes translated as "crosstalk." "Xiansheng" is a special kind of dialogue and a special kind of performance.

The comic language has many puns and allusions. The words are spoken in a fast, rushed manner. The comedy is a kind of banter. 

According to Canadian "xiangsheng" comedian Dashan (Mark Rowswell), the closest equivalent in English would be Abbott and Costello's "Who's on First?" sketch.

Modern "xiangsheng" is made up of four skills — speaking (說), imitating (學), teasing (逗), and singing (唱).

"Xiangsheng" was popular during the Qing Dynasty; and the comedic form has continued to evolve. 

A standard feature of CCTV's annual New Year's Gala is "Xiangsheng".

Oppidum

Oppidum (plural oppida) is a Latin word for the main settlement in any administrative area of ancient Rome. The word comes from "ob-pedum", an "enclosed space." This may in turn have come from the Proto-Indo-European word, "*pedóm-", meaning an "occupied space" or "footprint."

Julius Caesar called the larger Celtic Iron Age settlements he found in Gaul "oppida". The word is now used to describe the large pre-Roman towns that existed across Western and Central Europe. Many oppida grew from hill forts, but not all of them had an important defensive role. Oppida surrounded by earthworks are known as enclosed oppida. The main features of the oppida are:

The development of oppida was an important step in the urbanisation of Europe. They were the first large settlements north of the Mediterranean that could be described as towns. Caesar pointed out that each tribe of Gaul would have several oppida, but that they were not all of equal importance. This suggests that there was some form of hierarchy.

In conquered lands, the Romans took over the oppida to administer the empire, and many became full Roman towns. This often involved a change of location from the hilltop into the plain.

One of the best preserved oppida is at Enserune in France. It was occupied continuously from 6th century BC until the 1st century. Other oppida are now buried beneath large cities, such as Vindobona which is covered by Vienna.

The Mandarin orange, also known as the mandarin or mandarine (both lower-case), is a small citrus tree ("Citrus reticulata") with fruit that looks like other oranges. Mandarin oranges are usually eaten plain or in fruit salads. The mandarin is tender, and is damaged easily by cold. It can be grown in tropical and subtropical areas.

The mandarin is easily peeled with the fingers, and can be easily split into even segments without squirting juice. This makes it more convenient to eat, as utensils are not required to peel or cut the fruit. Mandarin segments are also sold in cans.

During Chinese New Year, Mandarin oranges and tangerines are considered traditional symbols of good fortune. During the two-week celebration, they are frequently displayed as decoration and presented as gifts to friends, relatives, and business partners.

Thermal expansion

In physics, thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in temperature. When a substance is heated, its constituent particles move around more quickly and by doing so generally maintain a greater average . Materials that contract with an increase in temperature are very uncommon; this effect is limited in size, and only occurs within limited temperature ranges. The degree of expansion divided by the change in temperature is called the material's coefficient of thermal expansion and generally varies with temperature. 

Thermometers are an example of using thermal expansion. They contain a liquid which can only move in one direction (along the tube) when volume changes along with temperature.

Samuel Morse

Samuel Finley Breese Morse (April 27, 1791 – April 2, 1872) was an American inventor. He was the first person to make a telegraph with only one wire, and also helped come up with the idea of Morse code.

Since the 1700s, there were different types of telegraphs being made, but they were hard to use because they had several wires. (The first telegraph ever built had 26 wires, which made it almost impossible to use.) Morse spent years trying to build one with only one wire, and managed to do it in 1836. Morse and his assistant made a code with "dots and "dashes", which were two different types of "clicks" on the telegraph.

Morse's invention made it possible to quickly communicate with people far away, and many telegraph lines were built. A telegraph line using his invention was built between Washington, D.C. and Baltimore in 1844. By the 1860s, there were telegraph lines all around North America, and in 1866, a telegraph line was built across the Atlantic Ocean.

Morse was a painter before he was an inventor. He was a professor of art at New York University. He wanted to do some paintings that were going to be done at the United States Capitol, but was not chosen to do them. He was so disappointed that he gave up painting.

Morse was a devout Christian. The first message he sent on his 1844 telegraph line was "What hath God wrought?", which comes from the Book of Numbers in the Bible.

<doc id="315836" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=315836" title="Ryan Stiles">
Ryan Stiles

Ryan Lee Stiles (born April 22, 1959) is an American actor, comedian, director, and voice actor whose work is often paired with improvisational comedy. He is best known for his improv and co-production work on the American and British versions of "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" and the role of Lewis Kiniski on "The Drew Carey Show". He played Herb Melnick on the CBS comedy "Two and a Half Men" and was a performer on the show "Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza".

Stiles was born in Seattle, Washington, the youngest of five children. His father, Sonny, was a fishing plant supervisor. Stiles lived in Vancouver, British Columbia as a teenager. At the age of seventeen, he dropped out of his high school, Richmond Secondary, to have a career in comedy. He worked in his father's fish-processing plant to earn a living. He then began performing improv with Vancouver TheatreSports League. In 1986, Stiles successfully auditioned for a berth at Toronto's renowned Second City comedy ensemble.

By 1989, the producers of the comedy show, "Whose Line Is It Anyway?", noticed his work. Stiles was a regular guest on the show until 1998, and the show's short production season allowed him to make numerous television and motion picture appearances in the United States.

In 1995, Stiles was asked by American comic Drew Carey to be a regular on his comedy "The Drew Carey Show". Stiles played Drew's smart but under best friend, Lewis Kiniski. Stiles' first line in the first episode of the show, "And that's why the French don't wash," is a line he had used in an episode of the British version of "Whose Line?".

In 1998, Carey successfully got ABC to get an American version of "Whose Line?" produced. Following the final season of the British version in 1998, the American version premiered, with both Stiles and Carey as executive producers. Stiles and Colin Mochrie were the only two actors to appear in every episode of the US version, though Wayne Brady also became a regular near the beginning of the second season. The series was produced until 2006.

Stiles was the most iconic performer on the original UK version of "Whose Line?", appearing in 76 of the series 136 episodes (including compilations). He first appeared in the fifth episode of the second season, which aired in late 1988. He appeared in one other episode of that season, before returning for four episodes of the third season. His prominence increased with each season, including appearances in every episode of Season 4 which was filmed in New York; ultimately appearing in every episode from the seventh season onwards.

Stiles was known for several recurring impressions he performed on the shows, performed both at his own decision and as an assignment in games. These included Carol Channing, Elvis Presley, John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Steve Irwin and Christopher Lloyd's character in "Taxi", Jim Ignatowski. He made clear his dislike of the musical segments of the show at every opportunity whenever he was chosen to perform in them, mostly because of his inability to form lyrics quickly. In particular, he disliked the games Hoedown and Irish Drinking Song, often reacting negatively (or sarcastically positively) to its being announced. Other than in early UK playings, Stiles was always the last performer to sing in Hoedown and other similar musical games, allowing him more time to devise lyrics, and giving him the final punch-lines, as well as injecting (usually not-so subtle) jabs at the Hoedown itself, or of the host for having him perform in it.

Stiles had first met Colin Mochrie years before while performing stand-up. They first performed together in Vancouver TheaterSports then in Second City, Toronto.There were a number of games which paired Mochrie and Stiles at every playing. Though other performers did so, he was the most common performer to make bald jokes at Mochrie. In return, Mochrie often made jokes about Stiles's height, nose, attractiveness, and tendency to wear exotic, flamboyant shoes, which were designed by George Esquivel. However, he would sometimes stand up to or make jokes at the other performers (including Drew Carey) who made fun of Mochrie's baldness or Mochrie in general, mostly during Scenes From A Hat.

Stiles received a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program in 2002 for his work on the show.

In 1981, Stiles met Patricia McDonald at Punchlines where she was waitressing. They lived together for seven years before marrying in 1988. They have three children: Sam, Mackenzie, and Claire. When not working in Hollywood, he lives at his home on Lake Sammamish, outside Bellingham, Washington, where he has opened the Upfront Theatre, a small theatre dedicated to live improv comedy.

Stiles once lived in a house previously owned by Liberace in Sherman Oaks, California, but he sold it.

Stiles appeared in the 1991 film "Hot Shots" as Mailman Farnham, and also starred in the 1993 sequel (follow-up) "Hot Shots! Part Deux", as marine Rabinowitz.

<doc id="315927" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=315927" title="Geocaching">
Geocaching

Geocaching is an outdoor sport activity based on GPS (Global Positioning System). Players use a receiver or mobile device and other navigational techniques to hide or look for containers, called "geocaches" or "caches".

One of the main ideas of geocaching is putting caches in places that are interesting, but not often visited by tourists. In the listing of the cache, information about the places is given.

After 11 years of activity there are over 1,582,000 active geocaches. There are over 5 million geocachers worldwide.

Geocaching was invented shortly after the removal of artificial error from GPS on May 2, 2000. Accuracy of the GPS before this date was about 100m, after this date is less than 3m. Improved accuracy allowed to specify where the cache is.

The first cache was placed on May 3, 2000, by Dave Ulmer in Beavercreek. It was found by Mike Teague of Vancouver on May 6, 2000. The original name of the game is GPS stash hunt, but it was changed on May 30, 2000 after the discussion of several players to geocaching.

The cache is usually in a waterproof plastic container with a logbook where geocachers write their registered nickname and date they find it. Larger containers usually contain items for trading like plastic toys, hockey cards or special trackable items called Travel Bugs or Geocoins. Trackable items are logged on the website and moved from cache to cache.

The coordinates of a hidden cache with the rating of the difficulty and terrain and information about size are placed by owner at the official website Geocaching.com. After checking by a reviewer, they are published and available for other geocachers.

Traditional cache: The basic cache type, hidden on the place defined by coordinates in header of listing.

Multi cache: The geocacher usually has to go over the stages, find some information at every stage (such as number on information board etc.) and at finish calculate coordinates of final cache.

Mystery/puzzle cache (also called "Unknown cache"): The coordinates of the final cache are usually hidden in some cipher, image or text and the geocacher has to discover it.

Letterbox hybrid cache: A combination of geocaching and letterboxing in the same container. Instead of a classic cache there is a stamp, which the finder can print to your diary.

Webcam cache: It is not a typical cache where the geocacher has to find a hidden box with a logbook. Instead, he has to find a webcam on the published coordinates and take a photo of himself.

Virtual cache: Similar to webcam cache, there is no hidden box at the coordinates. The geocacher only has to find out information such as the name on a monument and send it to the owner of the cache.

Earth cache: Very similar to virtual cache, but in geographically interesting place. The geocacher has to find out answers for the questions in a listing, take a photo here, and send it to the owner of the cache.

Event cache: Meeting organized and attended by geocachers. There is also special type of event – CITO (Cache in, trash out), where geocachers have to clean up an area. An event attended by more than 500 people is marked as a Mega-event.

Cardinal-nephew

A cardinal-nephew (; ;) was a pope's relative -- a nephew -- who was raised to the rank of cardinal. The practice of creating cardinal-nephews originated in the Middle Ages.

Cardinal-nephew was an office in the Curia of the Roman Catholic Church before 1692. After the death of the reigning pope, the office of cardinal-nephew was vacated. 

The pope's cardinal-nephew was his chief assistant and confident. The man in this role was expected to act as if he were a relative of the pope; and sometimes -- often, he was in fact a member of the pope's extended family. 

After 1692, this office was banned by Pope Innocent XII in "Romanum decet pontificem." 

This role and function is now filled by the Vatican's Secretary of State.

Notable cardinal-nephews include many who would later become popes:

Uncanny valley

The uncanny valley is a psychological theory about the effect involving art and robots and human emotions. As something starts to look more human-like, there is a point at which people start to feel it look wrong. At this point they have bad feelings toward the object. These feelings keep getting worse as the object is made to look more human-like. At a certain point, as the object starts to get very close to looking human-like, peoples feelings towards it tend to reverse and they have better emotional feelings towards it. The theory was created by the robotics professor Masahiro Mori in 1970.
One of the main points of the theory to explain this is that people are not as affected in an emotional way by the object if it is easy to tell it is not human. After a certain point, people start to feel emotionally about it, but feel bad emotions because it is so nonhuman. As it gets closer to looking human, they start to feel more positive emotions towards it. A graph of these feeling shows a valley. This is part of the reason for the naming of the theory.

James W. Black

Sir James Whyte Black, OM, FRS, FRSE, FRCP (14 June 1924 – 22 March 2010) was a Scottish doctor and pharmacologist. He was both as researcher and as an academic at many different universities. Black started the physiology department at the University of Glasgow. While there, he became interested in how adrenaline affected the human heart. He went to work for ICI Pharmaceuticals in 1958. While working for ICI, he created propranolol. Propranolol is a beta blocker. It is used for the treatment of heart disease. Black also created cimetidine. It is a drug used to treat stomach ulcers. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1988 for work in creating these drugs.

Black was born in Uddingston, Lanarkshire. He was the fourth of five sons of a Baptist family. His father was a mining engineer. He grew up in Fife. Black went to school at Beath High School, Cowdenbeath. At the age of 15, he won a scholarship to the University of St Andrews. At St Andrews, he studied medicine. He graduated in 1946.

After graduating he joined the Physiology department at University College as an Assistant Lecturer. He later took a lecturer position at the University of Malaya. Black had decided against a career as a medical practitioner as he objected to what he perceived as the insensitive treatment of patients at the time.

After graduation, Black took a teaching job in Singapore for three years. He moved to London in 1950. Later in 1950, he returned to Scotland. He joined the University of Glasgow (Veterinary School). At the University of Scotland, he started the Physiology Department. It was there that he became interesteed in how adrenaline affects the human heart. He was mainly interesting in how it affected people with angina. He found the effects of adrenaline did not help. He joined ICI Pharmaceuticals in 1958. He worked with the company until 1964. During this time, he created propranolol, It later became the world's best-selling drug. While at ICI, Black developed a new way of doing research. Before this, drug molecules would be created and then tested to find in what ways the molecules could be used as medicine. Black chose to pick a medical use and then try to create the molecules for that medicine. The discovery of propranolol was said to be the greatest discovery in the treatment of heart disease since the discovery of digitalis.

At the same time, Black was trying to find a treatment for stomach ulcers. ICI did not wish to do this so Black stopped working for them in 1964. He joined Smith, Kline and French. He worked for them for nine years until 1973. While there, Black developed his second major drug, cimetidine. It was first sold under the brand name Tagamet in 1975. Tagamet soon outsold propranolol to become the world's largest-selling prescription drug.

Black became the department head of pharmacology at University College London in 1973. He created a new undergraduate course in medicinal chemistry. He had many problems trying to get money for research, so he quit. He went to work for Wellcome Research Laboratories in 1978. He worked there until 1984. Black then became Professor of Analytical Pharmacology at the Rayne Institute of the King's College London medical school. He stayed there until 1992. He created the James Black Foundation in 1988 with money from Johnson and Johnson. He worked with 25 scientists in drugs research. This research included gastrin inhibitors which may stop some stomach cancers.

Black helped increase basic scientific and clinical knowledge in cardiology. His creation of propranolol is thought to be one of the most important contributions to clinical medicine and pharmacology of the 20th century. Propranolol has helped millions of people. 

Black was made a Knight Bachelor on 10 February 1981 for services to medical research. He received the honour from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. On 26 May 2000 he was appointed to the Order of Merit by the Queen.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1976. That same year he was awarded the Lasker award. In 1979, he was awarded the Artois-Baillet Latour Health Prize. In 1982 Black was awarded the Wolf Prize in Medicine. He was awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine along with Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings for their work on drug development. In 1994 he received the Ellison-Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine.

Digital electronics

Digital Electronics is a type of electronics. These make use of "boolean logic" and "discrete signal electronics" for electronics, devices, and equipment. 

Examples of such devices are computers, information appliances, digital cameras, digital televisions, flash memory, key USB memory, mobile phones, hard disks, and devices of computer memory.

Digital electronics is a branch of electronics concerning digital circuits which apply boolean logic which are represented by electronic logic gates. True and false are represented by different binary values with 0 volts for true and 5 volts for false. Digital circuits ae less vulnerable to noise but consume a lot of energy. Digital circuits were invented in the twentieth century and is the foundation for digital communications and computers.

Interstate 470 (Ohio – West Virginia)

Interstate 470 (I-470) is a long loop of Interstate 70. It goes around the city of Wheeling, West Virginia. The western end of the road is where it meets I-70 near Blaine, Ohio. Traveling southeast through Belmont County, the highway comes to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge which carries I-470 over the Ohio River. After crossing the river into Ohio County, West Virginia, the highway turns northeast. It runs towards the Wheeling neighborhood of Elm Grove. The road's eastern end is at I-70 near Wheeling Park.

On average, between 26,000 and 38,000 vehicles use the highway every day. During the rebuilding work on the Wheeling Tunnel, I-470 was one of two suggested detour routes to avoid the closed tunnel.

Video camera

A video camera is machine used to make electronic motion pictures. It serves to capture moving images and synchronous sound. The two kinds of video cameras are analog and digital. Analog video cameras produce signals that can be displayed with analog televisions. If the signals are not shown at the time that the image is captured, it can be stored in an analog format on magnetic tape. Digital video cameras produce digital images.

The first video camera was invented at the end of 19th century and approximately about 100 years later, people could buy the first digital video camera, which can almost immediately display the image. The first video camera, which could record the image on magnetic tape was created in the middle of 20th century.

At first, video cameras were large and expensive. Only professionals could operate them. As the electronics industry advanced, and solid state circuits with transistors and microprocessors replaced vacuum tubes, video cameras became smaller and inexpensive. Now many cellular telephones and other consumer electronic devices include video cameras. In addition, software is now widely available to edit or to compress the output from video cameras.
Modern video cameras have numerous designs and uses, not all of which resemble the early television cameras. 

Special uses of video cameras include systems that capture images at the finish line to time, horse races, automobile races and running events. Some toll roads use video cameras to capture automatically pictures of the license plate of any car that fails to pay tolls. Computers then identify the drivers and mail enforcement letters to collect the missed tolls.

The Maroon Masques

The Maroon Masques is the name for the Warren County High School department in Front Royal, Virginia. The Maroon Masques makes three main stage productions a year. Warren County High School is a AA school that competes in the AA Evergreen District which is a part of Region II in the Virginia High School League. Every fall they produce a one-act play that competes in the Evergreen District. In the winter they make a full length play and in the spring they do a musical.
In 2000, Warren County High School was apart of the Northwestern District. That year, the Maroon Masques performed the play "The Interview" under the direction of Ken Knesh (1999-2007) they finished in first place and moved on to the Region II Theatre festival at Broadway High School. The following year, they placed second in the district festival and went to the Region festival two years in a row. The Evergreen District was started in 2009 with Fauquier, Liberty, Kettle Run, Warren County and Brentsville, although Brentsville doesn't compete in theatre anymore. Under the direction of Chris Whitney (current director and drama coach, 2007-present), Warren County came in second and moved on to the Region II festival with the play "Medea" by Christopher Durang and Wendy Wasserstein.

On November 5th 2011, the Maroon Masques, with the one act play 'The Greek Mythology Olypiaganza! (Iliad! Iliad! Iliad!)' by Don Zolidis, competed in the Evergreen District Theatre Festival, held at Liberty High School, and placed 2nd, 1 point behind Fauquier High School. The top two schools moved on to the Region II festival. On November 19th 2011, the Maroon Masques competed in the Region II festival. Other competing schools included Millbrook, Briar Woods, Fauquier, Monticello, Loudoun County, Charlottesville, Loudoun Valley, and Skyline. The Maroon Masques finished 1st and they are moving on to the state competition along with 2nd place finishers Loudoun Valley. The state competition will be held on December 6th at Monticello High School.

Pope Innocent VI

Pope Innocent VI (c. 1282 – September 12, 1362), born Étienne Aubert, was an French cleric of the Roman Catholic Church and the 200th Pope from December 18, 1352 until his death in 1362.

He was the fifth of the seven popes who lived in Avignon in France.

Étienne Aubert was born in the hamlet of Les Monts, which is today part of the commune of Beyssac in the Corrèze department of France. He was the son of Adhemar Aubert (1260-?), seigneur de Montel-De-Gelas in Limousin. 

Aubert was made the Bishop of Noyon in 1338; and he became the Bishop of Clermont in 1340.

In 1342, he was raised to the position of cardinal.

Cardinal Aubert was elected pope on December 18, 1352. He chose to be called Innocent VI. 
Pope Innocent was involved in Italian and European political disputes.


The tomb of Innocent VI is at the Carthusian monastery of Villeneuve-les-Avignon.

Template:Show data

This template contains various independently retrievable data items about codice_1 in the form of parameter values of a variable template of choice, in a standardized fashion. It is a member of a family of templates, those with names starting with "Data" in . The system used is similar to that of .

Throughout the family of templates, fixed names are used for the parameters. (The parameter names are kept short to reduce counts for the and the in cases where these are applicable.) However, not necessarily all parameters have been given a value: some parameters may not be applicable, while for some other parameters the value may just have not been specified yet. The table shows all parameters, and for each the value, if specified. 

codice_1, using parameter selection template , gives the parameter "land area", etc.

For retrieval of more data items it is more efficient to prepare a template for that, to be used as follows:

codice_1

so that this data template needs to be called only once. The default template is , producing this page.

The four parameters are optional, they are passed on to the prepared template as parameters 2-5.

Special templates:

A parameter being undefined or empty typically means the same, see below. codice_1 gives the empty string and the text "codice_1", respectively. Therefore an application checking the parameter has to check both. Checking whether a result is equal to e.g. the text "codice_6" cannot be done directly with #ifeq in a template which itself has also a parameter with that name, because if that is defined, there would be a comparison with the value instead of the text itself. Instead, it can be checked whether the first character of the result is "codice_7", e.g.: codice_8.

 can be used to create new data templates. On the page of the data template of a province, if there is no data template yet for the country, a link appears to create that, preloading this template. Otherwise the wikitext can be copied to the new data template. For parameters which are not applicable, such as "country" for a country, the parameter definition "country=" can be deleted. For parameters to be filled in later the parameter definition like "popinc=" (specifying the empty string as value) can be left in the wikitext to be filled in later. Do not forget parameter 1.

In this template system each template contains various properties of a single entity, as opposed to the other common system, where a template contains one property (e.g. population or area) of many entities. Although that other system can be convenient if updates of a property for all these entities become available together, in the case of large-scale use of data on one page that other system can be problematic due to its inefficiency. This is because of the following:

The include part of the data template of an entity does not contain a long list of its sub-entities or their properties, because that would make this method inefficient too.

Broker

A broker is a middleman who brings others together to bargain, or bargains for them.

A broker is someone who helps arranges transactions between two parties.

The broker is sometimes a mediator between a buyer and a seller. The broker sometimes gets a commission when the deal is completed. 

A broker who also acts as a seller or as a buyer becomes a principal party to the deal. 

A broker is different than an agent: one who acts on behalf of a principal.

Azerbaijani Armed Forces

The Azerbaijani Armed Forces () is the military of the Republic of Azerbaijan.

The armed forces have three branches: the Azerbaijani Land Force, the Azerbaijani Air Force, and the Azerbaijani Navy. Related forces which are not part of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces, include the paramilitary Azerbaijani National Guard, the Internal Troops of Azerbaijan, and the State Border Service of Azerbaijan (who patrol Azerbaijan’s borders with Georgia, Russia, Iran, Turkey and Armenia), which can be involved in state defense.

The Commander-in-Chief of the military is the President of Azerbaijan, currently Ilham Aliyev. The Ministry of Defense is in charge of politicalleadership. It is currently headed by Safar Abiyev. Military command is in the hands of the General Staff, headed by the Chief of Staff, who is Colonel-General Najmaddin Sadigov. 

Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan has been trying to further develop its armed forces into a professional, well trained, and mobile military. Based on 2007 statistics the country has about 66,940 troops, and a paramilitary force of 15,000 troops. There are 300,000 former service personnel who have had military service in the last fifteen years. 

Azerbaijan had actually established the Azerbaijani Armed Forces and a Ministry of Defense on June 26, 1918 with the first independence of Azerbaijan, as the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, after the collpase of the Russian Empire in 1918 until it was invaded and annexed by the Soviet Union in 1920 which came after the Russian Empire. The Azerbaijani Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defense were established again in 1991 with the second and final independence of Azerbaijan, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the Azerbaijani Armed Forces were formed out of the former Soviet forces in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic.

In wartime, the Army proper could call the support of the paramilitary Azerbaijani National Guard, the Internal Troops of Azerbaijan, and the State Border Service of Azerbaijan (who patrol Azerbaijan's borders with Georgia, Russia, Iran, Turkey and Armenia), which can be involved in state defense. The exact wartime command structure is unknown.

Azerbaijan has also sent soldiers to be trained in Turkey, Russia and Israel over the past years, and these countries also sell weapons to Azerbaijan, among many countries. Since the end of the Nagorno-Karabakh War, Azerbaijan has made the army boost the defense of the country and possibly retake its separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh from neighboring enemy Armenia which invaded it, but is legally a part of Azerbaijan.

Aggression

Aggression refers to behavior between members of the same species that is intended to cause humiliation, pain, or harm.

Ferguson and Beaver defined aggressive behavior as ""Behavior which is intended to increase the social dominance of the organism relative to the dominance position of other organisms"”

Aggression takes a variety of forms among humans and can be physical, mental, or verbal.

There are two types of aggression - hostile, affective aggression and instrumental, predatory, or goal-oriented aggression.

Reactive relational aggression (hostile, affective, retaliatory) is used in response to feeling attacked, threatened, or mad. Usually the person who exhibits this type of aggression feels provoked to do so. Instrumental relational aggression (predatory, goal-oriented) is used in order for an individual to get what they want.

Predatory or defensive behavior between members of different species is not normally considered as "aggression."

Like most, or even all behaviors, aggression can be examined in terms of its ability to help an animal reproduce and survive. Animals may use aggression to gain and secure territories, as well as other resources including food, water, and mating opportunities.

The most apparent type of aggression is that seen in the interaction between a predator and its prey. An animal defending itself against a predator becomes aggressive in order to survive and predator in order to secure food. Because aggression against a much larger enemy or group of enemies would be nearly certain to lead to the death of an animal, animals have developed a good sense of when they are outnumbered. This ability to gauge the strength of other animals gives animals a "fight or flight" response to predators; depending on how strong they gauge the predator to be, animals will either become aggressive or flee.

Although humans share aspects of aggression with non-human animals, they differ from most of them in the complexity of their aggression because of factors such as culture, morals, and social situations.

Focal length

Focal length tells how strongly a lens, a curved mirror or another optical device brings light together or spreads it out. If rays of light go straight into a lens and the focal length is positive, the focal length is the distance to the point behind the lens where the rays will be brought to a focus. If the focal length of the lens is negative, the focal length is the distance at which the light has spread to twice its original size.

Protein Data Bank

The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a collection of information about the three dimensional (3-D) structure of large biological molecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids. Biologists and biochemists from around the world send in the data. Most data comes from X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. Anyone can access the PDB for free online. The Worldwide Protein Data Bank, wwPDB, manages the PDB.

The PDB is useful for scientists studying structural biology and structural genomics. Many scientists have to send their information to the database. Major scientific journals and some funding agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health in the United States have rules telling scientists to send the data to the PDB. The PDB has the original or primary data. Hundreds of other databases reuse the data. These secondary databases organize the information in different ways. For example, both SCOP and CATH put structures into groups organized by type of structure and ideas about how they are related through evolution. Gene ontology puts the data into groups based on genes.

The country was created as a separate British Crown Colony from the Straits Settlements about three months before the start of the 1948 Summer Olympics. It sent a team to the Games until 1964. At that time, Singapore was part of Malaysia. The team from Malaysia included people from Singapore. When Singapore became independent from Malaysia in 1965, the country began sending its own team again. It sent a team for every summer games after then except in 1980. The country boycotted the 1980 games along with many other countries. No athletes from Singapore have competed in any Winter Olympic Games.

The country has won two Olympic medals. The first medal was won by Tan Howe Liang, who won a silver medal in lightweight weightlifting in 1960. In table tennis, Jing Jun Hong and Li Jiawei came close to winning medals in Sydney in 2000. They finished in fourth place. They also finished fourth in the 2004 Athens Olympics. Singapore sent many athletes to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. It was felt that this was their best chance of winning a medal since 1960. This proved to be true.

In the Beijing, Li, together with Feng Tianwei and Wang Yuegu, beat the South Korea Women's Table Tennis team in the semi-finals. Because of this, they made it to the final match and would win at least the silver medal. Singapore lost to host China in the gold medal final.

Philip Showalter Hench (February 28, 1896 – March 30, 1965) was an American physician. Hench won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1950. He won the award along with his Mayo Clinic co-worker Edward Calvin Kendall and Swiss chemist Tadeus Reichstein . They won it for finding the hormone cortisone and its use for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis."

Hench went to university at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. He was trained as a physician at the United States Army Medical Corps and the University of Pittsburgh. Hench began working at Mayo Clinic in 1923. He later became the head of the Department of Rheumatology.

He attended Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. At Lafayette, he earned his Bachelor of Arts in 1916. After that, he served in the Medical Corps of the U.S. Army and the reserve corps to finish his medical training. He got a doctorate in medicine from the University of Pittsburgh in 1920. After getting his medical degree, Hench spent a year as an intern at St. Francis Hospital in Pittsburgh. Next, he became a Fellow of the Mayo Foundation.

In 1928 and 1929, Hench studied at Freiburg University and the von Müller Clinic in Munich.

Hench started his career at Mayo Clinic in 1923. He worked in the Department of Rheumatic Diseases. In 1926, he became the head of the department. While at Mayo Clinic, Hench worked mainly on arthritic diseases. This lead him to believe that steroids lessened the pain caused by the disease. During this time, biochemist Edward Calvin Kendall has found several steroids created by the adrenal gland cortex. After several years of work, Hench and Kendall decided to use one of these steroids on patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Testing of the hypothesis was delayed because the synthesis of Compound E was costly and time-consuming, and Hench served in the military during World War II. The tests were conducted successfully in 1948 and 1949. The steroid they used was named Compound E at the time. It later become known as cortisone.

Hench, Kendall and Swiss chemist Tadeus Reichstein won the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for "for their discoveries relating to the hormones of the adrenal cortex, their structure and biological effects." As of the 2010 prizes, Hench and Kendall are the only two Nobel winners who worked with Mayo Clinic. 
During his career, Hench was one of the founding members of the American Rheumatism Association. He was its president in 1940 and 1941. 

Hench has also gotten the Heberdeen Medal (1942), the Lasker Award (1949), the Passano Foundation Award (1950), and the Criss Award. Lafayette College, Washington and Jefferson College, Western Reserve University, the National University of Ireland and the University of Pittsburgh awarded Hench honorary doctorates.

Jan Adam von Auersperg came back from Italy with six seedlings of chestnut at the end of 18th century. He ordered that the seedlings were planted on the north side of Nasavrky hill. This happened between 1776 to 1778. The plants were the start of Kaštanka. In passing time, the set was expanded a lot. Kaštanka had over 110 trees in the turn of 19th and 20th century.
Kaštanka was made a nature monument on 1 December 1990. At that time, Kaštanka had over 138 trees. One of the first planted trees survives to this day. It was named "Knížák" in honor of prince Auersperg.
The chestnut became the sign of Nasavrky. It became the main motive in the emblem of the city Nasavrky, and the flag of Nasavrlky in 1996.

Kaštanka is natural monument which was declared as special protection area on 1st December 1990. The set of chestnuts is on a slight rise north ward. This area is in a built-up area about 100 meters from the city square. Kaštanka is at an altitude of 472 – 486. The area of set is 1,088 hectares large and all trees are chestnut trees expect a few that are on the edge.

Kaštanka was main theme of many artists like painters, sculptors and writers. Some writers wrote novels about Kaštanka. Two of the authors that did this were Marie Doležalová and Alois Stanislav Novák. Kaštanka gave Věra Vovsová, Jiří Poláček and Karel Pavlík the inspiration to make art.

Prequel

Prequel is a term in drama and literature: it means the opposite of sequel. When a story is told in several stages, it is natural to tell it in order of time. For example, a series of books on the Second World War started with the 1930s, and ended up in 1946. 

For various reasons, this does not always happen. In the film series "Star Wars", the first film was "" (1977). It was followed by three prequels, which were "" (1999); "" (2002) and "" (2005).

For correct use, the term 'prequel' is only applied when work is part of a series, and when the later publication refers to an earlier time. It is an old idea, but one which is often used today for drama on film and television. The "Cypria", a work of Ancient Greek literature, is a prequel to Homer's "Iliad". A related idea is the back-story, which is the background story of a main story or character.

Sandstone climbing

Sandstone climbing is a kind of rock climbing. It came from the Czech Republic. This is because there are a lot of sandstone towers there. Sandstone climbing has strong rules and tradition.
Climbing on sandstone offers a lot of different types of climbing. Old classic routes are in chimneys, corners and cracks. Modern hard routes are in smooth walls, around the edges of them, in slightly overhanging walls where the climber needs a lot of strength and very good technique in climbing on footholds.

If the climber wants to stay alive, they must be excellent in putting their own belay on. Because sandstone rocks in the Czech Republic are quite soft, the climber must use different types of knots on different types of ropes (e.g. thick or strong ropes or strap). A specific type of knot is a "money fist" (German: Kinderkopf), which the climber usually uses for belaying in off-width cracks. To put knots in cracks correctly, the climber needs a branch (or grip from a brush). The climber can put ropes around spikes or around sandclocks. The climber can not use iron belays like cam, friends or stoppers.

The climber can not use chalk to dry their hands. They can use the sand (ideal is small-grained), wooden sawdust or a mix of both of them.

For measure difficulties of climbing in route we use specific grade which came from Saxon. In old time this grade was closed (max grade was VI and then VIIc). This was problem because old routes with no ascent can be VIIc but also IXa and this is really different and very dangerous. Now the grade is open so we can use for our routes higher grade up to XIIa. But still is true that isn't important grade of route but who and when made the route and character and belay in route.
Sandstone rocks we can find in Saxon around river Elbe and in Czech, for example Czech paradise, Elbe Sandstone or around Adršpach.

Blind men and an elephant

The Blind men and an elephant is an idiom.

The story of the blind men and an elephant comes from India. It is about a range of truths and mistakes. It is also about the need for communication and the need for respect for different perspectives.

A group of blind men (or men in the dark) touch an elephant to learn what it is like. Each one feels a different part, but only one part. For example, one touches only the the side or and another touches only the tusk. 

The blind men discover that they disagree when each describes what he has learned from touching the elephant. 

A famous version of story is a poem -- "The Blind Men and the Elephant" by John Godfrey Saxe (1816–1887).

The poem begins:
It was six men of Indostan
To learning much inclined,
Who went to see the Elephant
(Though all of them were blind),
That each by observation
Might satisfy his mind

They conclude that the elephant is like a wall, snake, spear, tree, fan or rope, depending upon where they touch.

Kaskaskia, Illinois

Kaskaskia is a village in Randolph County, Illinois, United States. In 2010 the population was only 14, making it the second-smallest incorporated community in Illinois. It was a major French colonial town of the Illinois Country. Its peak population was about 7,000 when it was a regional center. Kaskaskia became the capital of the Illinois Territory on February 3, 1809. In 1818, Illinois became the 21st U.S. state and Kaskaskia was its capital until 1819. 

In April 1881, the Mississippi River moved its path to the east. This flooded most of the town. The river now passes east rather than west of the town. The state boundary line, however, remained in its original location. Kaskaskia is on a small part of Illinois west of the river. It can only be reached from Missouri. 

The town was named after the Native American word for the Kaskaskia River. The site of Kaskaskia had been a Native American village for thousands of years. In 1703 French Jesuit missionaries started a mission. They wanted to change the Illini (Native American) people's religion to Catholicism. The first stone church was built in 1714. The French also had a fur trading post at the village. French settlers came to farm and mine lead on the Missouri side of the river. In 1718 Kaskaskia became the capital of Upper Louisiana and a fort, Fort de Chartres,was built.
From its beginning, Kaskaskia was a French/Indian settlement, with a few French men and many Illinois and other Native Americans. In 1707, the population was about 2,200. Most were Illinois, who lived somewhat apart from the Europeans. From the French, the Native Americans, and their mixed-race descendants at Kaskaskia came the voyageurs and coureurs des bois. They explored and hunted in the Missouri River country. The French wanted to trade with all the Prairie tribes, and with the Spanish colony in New Mexico. This idea horrified the Spanish. The explorer Claude Charles Du Tisne set up trade relations with the Plains Indians in 1719.

King Louis XV sent a bell to Kaskaskia in 1741 for its church. During French rule, Kaskaskia and the other farming settlements in the Illinois Country were important for supplying Lower Louisiana, especially New Orleans, with wheat and corn. Farmers sent tons of flour south over the years. These staple crops could not grow in Louisiana's climate.

In 1733, the French built Fort Kaskaskia. The British destroyed the fort in 1763 during the French and Indian War. After the war France gave up the territory east of the river. Many French-speaking people from Kaskaskia and other colonial towns moved west of the Mississippi to Ste. Genevieve, St. Louis, and other areas.

On July 4 1778, during the American Revolution, the city was captured by George Rogers Clark and his force of 200 men including Captain Leonard Helm. It was one of the western-most battles of the Revolution. The parish rang the church bell in celebration, which has since been called the "liberty bell". The bell is housed in a brick building near the Church of the Immaculate Conception. The brick church was built in 1843 in the squared-off French style.

As a center of the regional economy, Kaskaskia was the capital of Illinois Territory from 1809 until Illinois became a state in 1818. Zaskaskia continued as the state capital until 1819. Its peak population was about 7,000 before the capital moved in 1819 to Vandalia. Although introduction of steamboats on the Mississippi River helped the economies of river towns in the 19th century, their use also had devastating environmental effects. Loss of trees (Deforestation) along the river banks was caused by steamboat crews' cutting trees to feed the engine fires. River banks became unstable and collapsed into the water.

At first, the town had a good site where the Kaskaskia and Mississippi Rivers joined. But from St. Louis to the junction of the Ohio River, the Mississippi became wider and more shallow, with more severe flooding. Much of Kaskaskia and other French colonial towns have been lost through flooding and erosion. Following the Great Flood of 1844, Kaskaskia was rebuilt to the south. The original site became an island, surrounded by the Mississippi River. The flood of 1881 destroyed the original town, and the Mississippi shifted into the channel of the Kaskaskia River, passing east instead of west of the town. Parts of the town were rebuilt in the new area.

As the Mississippi continued to flow through its new bed, earth was deposited so that the village became physically attached to the west bank of the river, which is in the state of Missouri. Now a bayou, the old river bed, is regularly flooded. It has a bridge to carry traffic over it. In 1893, the people of the town moved and rebuilt the Church of the Immaculate Conception on Kaskaskia Island.

By 1950 only 112 people lived in Kaskaskia. By 1970 the population had fallen to 79, and it continued to fall to 33 in 1980. The town was flooded with nine feet of water by the Great Flood of 1993, which reached the roofs of the buildings. By 2000, with a only nine residents, Kaskaskia was almost a ghost town and the least populous incorporated community in the State of Illinois.

Kaskaskia is located at .
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total land area of 0.2809 km² (0.1085 sq mi, or 69.41 acres), all land. However, the village is only a small part of Kaskaskia Precinct, which includes all of Randolph County's land west of the Mississippi. Kaskaskia Precinct has a land area of 24.037 square miles (62.255 km²) and a 2000 census population of 36 persons. In 1993 the Mississippi River almost completely flooded the island.

Does no one have any comment on the original question? Have I not waited long enough for responses? Would anyone have a problem if I just be bold and pick one of the options? The reason I'm interested in this is that some tagged articles fall through the cracks with the way things are done now. For example, if a date is given but the dated category is not defined, and there's no category that holds all tagged articles (dated or not), then the article doesn't show up in a defined category. That can happen with option #2. I'm also looking at differences between processing an individual tag such as and using the "refimprove" parameter in . Thanks. -- () 03:33, 15 November 2011 (UTC)

I have a near conspiratorial grievance with Wikipedia. There seems to be a concerted and consistent effort to purge certain unpopular facts about people's backgrounds in their articles. The facts shouldn't be altered by the current cultural marxist zeitgeist. If they are going to report anybody's ethnicity, they should report everybody's ethnicity. If someone is part "Jewish" but has "other" ancestors, they don't become just "Jewish". Their "other" ancestors' ethnicities must be reported. If you're going to report on one of their ancestors, you must report on them all, or you undermine your objectivity and credibility. All I demand is uniformity and fairness, that is all. I find these trends disturbing. I have altered multiple articles that comport to this trend. This is my official formal complaint and mandate that Wikipedia follow this paradigm. I'm left wondering, are some "special", "chosen" ancestors more important than others? And remember, you can't choose your genetic and ethnic history. It's a matter of fact, not opinion. You can identify culturally with a group but that does not render you ethnically of that group at all, let alone entirely. Don't conflate the two. That's also fact, not opinion. The website might even be wise to segregate the two. No more promoting some groups and their successes and denigrating or censoring others. Just facts, how's that? That's what encyclopedias are supposed to be about.

I am upset about a particular webpage. I am not an expert, and I don't claim to be an expert, but simple math and first hand knowledge result in me concluding that the webpage in question is wildly inaccurate. In particular, I am speaking about the webpage for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In one part of the page the claim is made that only 3% of the population is not Muslim. In another portion of the page, the claim is made that 20% (1/5) of the population is non-resident (immigrant-work permit). Having grown up in Saudi Arabia, I will concur to the second claim, but I question how the initial claim can be true if the second claim is true. I don't believe it can be. I also object to references of suppression of other belief systems in the KSA. I have several photographs in my possession documenting "open" and "other" holidays which were celebrated in the KSA. In particular, my favorite photograph has on display a Halloween float. This float has a "Happy halloween" sign written in arabic. The people who are standing in front of the float are (presumably, from attire) from India, America/or Europe, and from Saudi Arabia. 

There is a great tolerance for other faiths in the KSA. If, as a Christian, I can presume, I would quote from the Qu'ran:

“Say: ‘Unbelievers, I do not worship what you worship, no do you worship what I worship. I shall never worship what you worship, nor will you ever worship what I worship. You have your own religion and I have mine.” (Qur’an 110:1-6)
. . . Do not say to one who offers you peace, “You are not a believer,” seeking the spoils of this life. For God has abundant treasure. You used to be like them, after all, and then God blessed you. [Qur’an 4:94]

I do not understand how I can put any faith into Wiki content, when such blatant misrepresentations are allowed to continue without contemplative editing.

As I'm sure most have seen, we have a ton of . I haven't touched them because they raise a question that I've never seen before. Do we want to categorize images? Our QD policy says we can't upload locally, it doesn't say we can't create the File space pages and categorize them. What does the community think? Do we want to allow them to be categorized here, or not?

Some big words have special meanings and connotations to them. To use another word would be difficult, because the big word is the perfect word that fits the context. Take "recidivism", for example. This may look like a mouthful, but really it means the tendency to return to former behavior. I have a hunch that this Simple English Wikipedia, if it wants to describe certain words with special meanings, would have to make the articles more wordier rather than sticking to brevity.

I have been thinking about creating a team effort project that we all can collaborate in. The project is about expanding articles (and other articles not listed but are of importance in life) to status. An encyclopedia should be a place where people can get comprehensive information about a topic of choice, and since Simple contains "mostly" stub articles, I think its time to worry more about adding information then creating stubs that drive newcomers away to English Wikipedia. I've been thinking about having a two-month (December 1, 2011 - February 1, 2012) long drive called "Very Good Article Drive" (VGAD) and separating topics into groups. For an example: (these are just examples of articles that would be considered in the list; furthermore, we don't need 4 groups if consensus agree)



These groups could have a min of 3 users (per group) who work together in expanding the articles in their group to VGA status. However, users who work in a group can't work at another since that would be violating . At the end of the drive, each group must review other groups articles and gather consensus on weather or not the article meets the criteria; this can lower chances that articles will remain at the nominations for a very long time. This isn't a "project" that needs its own page here, moreover, this team effort is just a collaboration to get vital articles to VGA status. One of the benefits of this are; (1) working as a team (2) building Simple Wikipedia as an encyclopedia (3) gaining viewership and users who aren't acquainted with Simple to join and best of all (4) it'll be fun :-) (my PoV) So what do you guys think? If you are interested in helping just say which group you would like to join. Best, 22:50, 29 November 2011 (UTC)

Hello,

Our VGA requirement number 10 ("Content that is from books, journal articles or other publications needs to be referenced. This can either be done with <nowiki></nowiki> tags, or as a list of publications. For articles that have references or external links on the English Wikipedia, there must be at least one in the Simple English article as well.") references the regular English language wikipedia. I think that this can lead to confusion. Potentially, we may have a VGA-candidate that does not exist on another wikipedia. Take the case of an editor coming from another Wikipedia (Chinese, Arabic, Russian, Ido...) improving an article that only exists in that Wikipedia to a standard that it can be a VGA candidate? - What about Simple having articles that do not exist in other Wikipedias? - Can those articles not reach VGA status? - For that reason I propose to get rid of the second part of the requirement ("For articles that ...").

Hi, I am a new user. ( ) 03:07, 10 December 2011 (UTC)
Welcome! 12:33, 11 December 2011 (UTC)

Hi there,

I'd like to advice you about this message that I sent to the WM Foundation mailing list a few week ago.

It is about kind of equivalent to "simple" in dutch, french and spanish, but intended for children.

By the way, I found this other message (Jun 2010) which says : ""Considering the historical role of the children's encyclopedia, we might consider rescoping "simple" as "for children" -- this could help to increase participation and use, and clarify the role of these projects.""

What do you think about it ? () 23:23, 10 December 2011 (UTC)

I'm sorry...I'm not seeing the point here. If you think there is a need for a WikiKids in English, go make one at Vikidia. But we're not going to change our ways or mission because someone coming in from the outside says we should. Additionally, the US has not ratified the Convention on the Rights..., and since Wikimedia is based in the US, the conventions have no relevance here. And it's not like we're preventing children from using Wikipedia...they can and do. They have the right to seek, receive and impart information...no where does it say "this information must be put into ways they'd understand." () 12:31, 11 December 2011 (UTC)


My input is that this Simpple English Wikipedia should not be rescoped. I've seen several editors here who appreciate us because their first language is not English. I don't remember seeing any say they appreciate us because they're children. As far as articles that a target audience might not "be ready for": as an official policy, .

If a children's Wiki were to be established elsewhere, I believe the licensing on Wikipedia would allow articles from here to be used there if credit is given. (Someone please correct me if that's wrong.) The other Wiki could pick and choose which articles they wanted from here. -- () 21:35, 11 December 2011 (UTC)

Hey everyone, just letting everyone know that the will begin Wednesday, December 14, 2011 and will run until January 14, 2012. For those wondering what the team effort is or would like to nominate an article please click on the wikilink for more information. Best, 17:33, 12 December 2011 (UTC)

I have so many people telling me so many different things about this, we need consensus to see what the "rule" is for certain. For three (American) holidays I have wished my fellow Americans a happy <Fourth of July/Thanksgiving> only to have it either reverted or complained about by either Dj or scream. I then find people that find nothing wrong with it (i.e. Normandy or Gordon), it's confusing so I need to know for certain through consensus, am I or am I not allowed to celebrate a holiday with a small thread like this on ST? Thanks. | 23:38, 24 November 2011 (UTC)

There isn't anything wrong with wishing people a happy holiday. It cheers me up and reminds me that this place isn't all serious. If people were allowed to put things like "happy holidays!", "seasons greetings!" and "merry Christmas!" in their signatures at Christmas, then why is it not allowed to wish people a happy Thanksgiving on Simple Talk? - 11:24, 25 November 2011 (UTC)

Forgive me if I don't spend too much time on this, and thank you for the discussion notification: I think it was highly inappropriate to just address Americans was all. Very best, @:~$ 11:28, 25 November 2011 (UTC)

Wikipedia is supposed to be apolitical and neutral. Wishing someone a Happy Whatever is a violation of and technically in that its a social thing not related to the building of an encyclopedia. If you wish to do such things do it on IRC where that is the point of it. People shouldn't be wishing Merry Christmas either. - () 13:03, 25 November 2011 (UTC)


I really don't give a crap about this debate, but since everyone seems to be spending their time talking about this...could someone take a look at ? Please and thank you. I figure since we're spending time on this, you might be able to spend a few minutes looking at the article! Thanks! () 19:12, 25 November 2011 (UTC)

Currently, does not have an option to omit a flag. Can this be written into the template somehow, as it is needed on pages like Western Sahara and Kosovo. I cannot edit the template (I also have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to wiki markup). () 20:45, 3 December 2011 (UTC)

I noticed that English Wiki has a Wikipedia Humour section, and I wondered if the same section could be created here. i had some doubts, as we try to be "simple" here on Simple English, but I felt that I had to ask. () 01:32, 13 December 2011 (UTC)

Hey all! Just an FYI but there are too many SNOW or QD deletions that are being taken to RFD. Please consider more carefully which method of deletion action should be used. Thanks :) 03:04, 16 December 2011 (UTC)

Is this the place to ask someone to correct a small spelling error in an article title? Is this called a "move"? The article about the Japanese era name "Hōtoku" should be spelled with a diacritic line above the first vowel ("") -- see In other words, "Hotoku" should be a redirect for "Hōtoku". For now, this is backwards. -- () 20:15, 16 December 2011 (UTC)

Hi everyone. I propose adding a link to the Administrators' Noticeboard in the "getting around" sidebar. Personally, I think it'd make it easier for new users to find where to go for administrator help. Thoughts? -- 22:20, 5 December 2011 (UTC)

Personally I would rather it not be on the sidebar so it doesn't get confused with simple talk. Simple talk is where people should come with questions and looking for help. Administrator notice board on the other hand is for things that need to be brought to administrator attention such as needing admin intervention in a dispute or clearing up a backlog etc. I think newer users would get the two mixed up quite easily if we had them both lists. I already see people getting them mixed up now without it being listed. As for on the help contents page that makes sense. - () 17:00, 6 December 2011 (UTC)

I the idea. | 05:15, 11 December 2011 (UTC)


Are there any bots on Simple that could remove redlinks from the reference section? I really don't want to manually do it. Best, 00:29, 17 December 2011 (UTC)

I have to agree with BG here, wedlocks redlinks helps to expand the encyclopedia. @:~$ 18:27, 17 December 2011 (UTC)

Psychopathy

Psychopathy is a mental illness. It is generally seen as a more severe form of antisocial personality disorder. People suffering from psychopathy are unemotional and do care about the emotions or rights of others. They show almost no empathy, and do not try to conform to social norms. Very often they lack conscience and do not feel remorse. Psychopaths are charming and often manage to have superficial ties with other people, which they use to manipulate other people to their benefit. Psychopaths often show other antisocial behaviour as well, including sadism, violence and deception. They discard people who they have no further use for. They tend to have many children by many partners.

There are efforts to use behaviour therapy to treat psychopaths; very often, this is done in prisons. 

Popular science also labels other characters as "psychopaths": These have no problems with social norms, but they are good at influencing people.

Map projection

A map projection is a way of showing the surface of a three-dimensional sphere on a plane. Such projections are necessary to create maps. The problem with projections is that they change the surface in some way; this is called distorsion. Depending on the purpose of the map, some distorsions may be acceptable. For this reason, there are different map projections that serve different purposes.

Carl Friedrich Gauss showed that is not possible to project the surface of a sphere to a plane, without distorting it. This theorem is known as Theorema egregium today.

To understand the projections, it is easier to imagine a light source, a globe, and another geometric object. The light source shines "a shadow" of each point of the globe onto the geometric object. At the end the surface of the geometric object is unrolled, this yields the map. It is possible to tell the projections apart by the type of helper object used.

Road Town

Road Town, located on Tortola, is the capital of the British Virgin Islands. It is next to the horseshoe-shaped Road Harbour in the centre of the island's south coast. The town's population was about 9,400 in 2004.

The name comes from sailing. "The roads" means a place less sheltered than a harbor but where ships stop. Its marina made Road Town a popular place in the Caribbean for chartering yachts. Cruise ships often dock here. Road Town also has tourism.

The Harbour is the dock for many of the ferries servicing the island. The ferry terminal is at the south-west end of Road Town. Ferries run during the day every day of the week. A 28 hectare (70 acre) development called Wickham's Cay, is on two areas of man-made land. The HM Prison on Main Street is the oldest building in Road Town. It was built in the 1840s. People disagree about where the borders of the town are.

The Emancipation Proclamation was read on 1 August 1834. This gave slaves their freedom, even though slavery had been officially abolished in 1807.

In 1853, a fire destroyed nearly every building in Road Town. Angry rioters spread the fire to protest an increase on the cattle tax. Rioters burned most of the plantations across the island.

Couvade syndrome

Couvade (French, from "couver" 'to hatch', from Latin "cubare" 'lie down) describes the imitation of a pregnancy. It is performed by the man. The anthropologist E. B. Tylor was the first person that made use of the name couvade. 

To do so, the father carries out the same restrictions as the mother. These usually start closer towards the end of the pregnancy. It often proceeds for various amounts of time after child birth. Restrictions: Certain food taboos, staying only in the village or at home, avoiding certain places, no consumption of alcohol, cigarettes or stimulants or handling with sharp instruments. In some cases, the man copies the woman’s behaviour and pains during childbirth.

The couvade is known throughout history, for example in the ancient Greece and the Roman Empire, in the Basque country and in the south of France. These days, it still exists in various cultures around the world among indigenous people in India, Thailand, Indonesia, China, Africa and North and South America.

These range from the spiritual and physical protection of the child, bonding of father with child as well as wife, the public recognition of fatherhood and support and relief of mother so she can maintain the household after the childbirth. The reasons for couvade are in some cultures linked to certain myths that give instructions and show what can go wrong if the parents do not follow them. 

It is believed to have huge impacts on the child such as illness, disability, death and the transformation into other creatures.

Matsudaira Sadanobu

Sadanobu was born in Edo on January 15, 1759, into the Tayasu branch of the Tokugawa clan. The Tayasu was one of the "gosankyō". The Tayasu were the oldest members of the Shogun's family who still had the name Tokugawa. The other members of the family had the Matsudaira surname.

His father was Tayasu Munetake and he was the grandson of the eighth shogun Tokugawa Yoshimune. The Tayasu house held different beliefs than the others living in Edo Castle. They lived a lifestyle that was more strict. The Tayasu following the example set by Yoshimune. In Munetake's words, the praise of manly spirit ("masuraoburi") as opposed to feminine spirit ("taoyameburi"). This set them apart from the rest of the family. Munetake thought he would rule after his father died. This did not happen. Yoshimune's eldest son, Ieshige became ruler. Because of this, Sadanobu was raised under the belief that he would be the next heir to the title of Shogun. His education growing up was very good. He was taught along Confucian lines. By the time Sadanobu was in his teens, he had already learned much of the teachings of Confucius. As he grew older, many expected more strongly for Sadanobu do well because many members of the Tayasu house began to die young. The family tried many ways to make Sadanobu as the next shogun. Their attempts were stopped by the political clique of Tanuma Okitsugu. Okitsugu was the chief rōjū at that time.

After the last failed try to get Sadanobu adopted by the shogun, Sadanobu was adopted by Matsudaira Sadakuni. Sadakuni was head of one of the Hisamatsu-Matsudaira houses. This was another part of the Tokugawa branch of the family. They ruled the Shirakawa Domain in southern (Mutsu Province. 

Sandanobu took control of Shirakawa in 1783. As soon as he took control he had to deal with a very bad problem. The lands he controlled were said to be worth 110,000 "koku". 1 Koku was the amount of rice needed to feed one person for one year. The land should have been able to create enough rice to feed 110,000 people for a year. But 108,600 Koku was said to be "lost". Sadanobu worked constantly to fix the economic problem in Shirakawa. He work fixed the problems of the finances and economy of the lands. The changes he made, along with his political workings made him very famous. Because of this, he was named chief councilor of the Shogunate in the summer of 1787. He was also made regent to the 11th shogun Tokugawa Ienari early the next year.

Sadanobu was also known as a writer. He wrote using the pen name "Rakuō" (楽翁). Some of his notable texts include "Uge no Hitokoto", "Tōzen Manpitsu", "Kanko-dōri", "Kagetsutei Nikki", "Seigo", and "Ōmu no Kotoba", among others. After his death, it was learned that he had written a satirical text parodying daimyo life. It was named "Daimyō Katagi".

This problem of labelling comes about because the word 'modern' in art was used for some art from the mid-Victorian period through the whole 20th century. It covers a wide range of styles and movements. So when art critics wanted to describe post-WWII art they had to use a different word. Thus, in art, 'contemporary' (which really means 'at the same time as') comes to mean 'modern', and modern comes to mean 'earlier'.

Russian Ground Forces

The Russian Ground Forces (Russian: Сухопутные войска Российской Федерации) are the land forces of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, formed after the break up of the Soviet Union. Since 1992, the Russian troops have withdrawn from many Soviet posts, but the branch has been determined to the Chechen Wars, peace keeping, and other operations in the post-Soviet states.

The President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev is the supreme commander-in-chief of the Russian Ground Forces. The headquarters is located in Moscow.

The branches of service is the rifle troops, tank troops, artillery and rocket forces, troop air defense, special corp, etc. The rifle troops (Motorised Rifle Troops) are the main part of the Russian Ground Forces. The branch controls all the battle formations. The branch also has all the destructive weapons for defense against land and aerial forces. The tank troops are an important branch in the Russian Ground Forces that is responsible for the defense in important combat tasks. The artillery and rocket forces is a branch that has the most firepower for the Russian Ground Forces. The troops are defense is currently a branch under control by the Russian Air Force, but by 2015, the branch will be under control again by the Russian Ground Forces. Lastly, the special corp is a branch that takes care of the engineering, radioelectronic warfare, chemical and biological protection, radiation, technical support, etc.

The Russian Ground Forces are known to have a very large amount of equipment. A lot of this equipment is believed to be from the Soviet Union. Other countries seemed to get more modern equipment, while Russia was left with old Soviet equipment. Russia wanted to get more updated pieces, but the economy was not on the country's side.

Most of the ranks are very similar the the Soviet Army's ranks. Most of the names of the ranks came from current German, French, English, Dutch and even Polish ranks. Very few changes have been made since the Soviet Union's breakup.

The Russian Ground Forces is known to have high crime rates for a military. The United States Foreign Military Studies Office said that the Russian Ground Forces is "an institution increasingly defined by the high levels of military criminality and corruption embedded within it at every level," which is basically saying that the Russian Ground Forces has high levels of crime and corruption placed in every level. Some crimes would include the stealing of weapons, assisting drug smugglers, high corruption and even claims of contract killings.

Lawrence Ferlinghetti

Lawrence Ferlinghetti (born March 24, 1919) is an American poet, painter, liberal activist, and the co-founder of City Lights Bookstore. He is the author of poetry, translations, fiction, theatre, art criticism, and film narration.

Chinese dynasties

China is known as a society with a rich and amazing history. The history was influenced especially by ruling dynasties which they gradually changed the china in the current form.
Xia (2100-1600 BC) 

Xia is actually first ruling dynasty in Chinese history probably established by emperor Yu the Great. However there are some doubts about the existence of Xia dynasty. Many people things that the Xia dynasty is only a legend because there are no convincing evidence that can positively prove that there was some dynasty before age 1600 BC. But perhaps it seems we will definitely known the true in short time. There were found some archaeological excavations from 1500 BC which may come from the Xia dynasty. For example one of the excavations points us to the meaning that the foundations of China was laid during Xia dynasty. Also there are findings of the Chinese oldest dating calendar called a lunar calendar. Xia dynasty ends by adherents of new ruling dynasty named Shang.
Shang (1600-1046 BC)

In the head of Shang dynasty was a wang who was a king of the Chinese empire. He was also a highest spiritual representative. Other significant persons were scribes and priests. Ordinary people were artisans, peasants and slaves. For the Shang regents were typical to building a walls around the cities and interesting temples. 

Shang dynasty was important for Chinese culture because there were developed first Chinese character fonts mainly used by seers and shamans. People produced their own ritual vessels, agricultural and craft tools, even weapons. Everything were perfect and aesthetically made of cast bronze.

People of Shang dynasty believed in natural forces and ancestor cult. The most venerated spiritual beings was Shan-ti the front of royal family. They often followed the prophesies. For example when they made some decision.

In agriculture were grown millets, wheats and rice. In addition there were grown mulberries which is a feeding for mulberry silkworms. This kind of worms were priced for their ability to produced a silk from cocoon. 
Zhou (1045-256 BC)

Shangs became weak because they were constantly fighting with a neighboring tribes. It was a good opportunity for less advanced dynasty Zhou. They defeat Shang dynasty in the current main town named An-yang. After that the Zhou dynasty took the government and ruled for the longest period of all Chinese dynasties. 

Zhous were originally nomadic shepherds who came from Shanxi province. The rulers of Zhou dynasty divided the country into four smaller territories which were controlled by relatives and members of aristocracy. Princes managed territorial units of fortified towns with a peasant background and supported the rulers war campaign. This efficient government form allowed the Zhou rulers to expand their sphere influence.

Ethernet hub

An ethernet hub is an electronic device that runs a computer network. It is a simple device and is easy to configure. A hub acts like a repeater: all data what arrive to one port are sent to all other ports (without looking at IP address for the data's destination). That means that all devices in this network will get all data. So, this slows the network. A hub is very simply device and does not operate Ethernet traffic. In contrast, a switch hub has a lower latency. Many hubs have LED signal lamps to show the state of the hub (which ports are connected and if the hub working). A "collision" happens when two or more devices on the same network try to send packets at the same time. When collisions happen all of the devices have to go though a routine to resolve the conflict. The process is set in the Ethernet Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) protocol.

Some hubs may also come with a BNC and/or Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) connector to allow connection to legacy 10BASE2 or 10BASE5 network segments.

There are three kinds of hubs:

Hubs can be used for:
Historically, the main reason for purchasing hubs rather than switches was their price. Today few hubs are produced, because they are not an effective solution for building networks.

<doc id="316436" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316436" title="Lancaster, Pennsylvania">
Lancaster, Pennsylvania

Lancaster (Pennsylvania Dutch: "Lengeschder") is a city in the south-central part of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It is the county seat of Lancaster County. It is one of the older inland cities in the United States. It has a population of 59,322. It ranks eighth in population among Pennsylvania's cities. The Lancaster metropolitan area population is 507,766. So, it is 101st among US metropolitan areas.

Lancaster was home to James Buchanan, the nation's 15th president, and to congressman and abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens.

The city's primary industries include healthcare, tourism, manufacturing, and professional services. It also has the Park City Center shopping mall. A controversial, citywide video surveillance system includes the most outdoor cameras per capita of any US city.
It was first called Hickory Town. Its first leader, John Wright, renamed the city after his home English city of Lancaster. The city's symbol, the red rose, is from the House of Lancaster. Lancaster was part of the 1681 Penn's Woods Charter of William Penn, and was laid out by James Hamilton in 1734. It was incorporated as a borough in 1742 and incorporated as a city in 1818. When the British captured Philadelphia in the American Revolution, Lancaster became the capital of the colonies on September 27, 1777. After the Continental Congress met one day, they moved still farther away, to York, Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania government also moved from Philadelphia to Lancaster, but stayed in Lancaster until the British troops left Philadelphia. Lancaster was capital of Pennsylvania again from 1799 to 1812, after which the capital was moved to Harrisburg.

In 1737, the Lancaster County Prison was built in the city, styled after Lancaster Castle in England. The prison remains in use. Public hangings were conducted there until 1912.

The first paved road in the United States was the former Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike (which makes up part of the present-day U.S. Route 30). The Turnpike opened in 1795. The Turnpike connected the cities of Lancaster and Philadelphia, and was designed by a Scottish engineer named John Loudon MacAdam. Lancaster residents are known to use the word, ""macadam"", instead of "pavement" or "asphalt". This name is a reference to the paving process used by MacAdam.

The city of Lancaster was home to several important figures in American history. Wheatland, the estate of James Buchanan, the fifteenth President of the United States, is one of Lancaster's most popular attractions. Thaddeus Stevens, considered among the most powerful members of the United States House of Representatives, lived in Lancaster as an attorney. Stevens gained notoriety as a Radical Republican and for his abolitionism. The Fulton Opera House in the city was named for Lancaster native Robert Fulton, who had designed the modern steamboat. 

After the American Revolution, the city of Lancaster became an iron-foundry center. Two of the most common products needed by pioneers to settle the Frontier were manufactured in Lancaster: the Conestoga wagon and the Pennsylvania long rifle. The Conestoga wagon was named after the Conestoga River, which runs through the city. 

In 1803, Meriwether Lewis visited Lancaster to be educated in survey methods by the well-known surveyor Andrew Ellicott. During his visit, Lewis learned to plot latitude and longitude as part of his overall training needed to lead the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

In 1879, Franklin Winfield Woolworth opened his first successful "five and dime" store in the city of Lancaster. The F. W. Woolworth Company is succeeded by Foot Locker.

Lancaster was one of the winning communities for the All-America City award in 2000.

Lancaster is located at 40°02'23" North, 76°18'16" West (40.039860, -76.304366), and is above sea level.

The city is located about southeast of Harrisburg, west of Philadelphia, north-northeast of Baltimore and north of Washington, D.C.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and 0.14% is water.
According to Lancaster's 2009 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:

Lancaster has one of the highest rates of green roof space per capita in the US.Lancaster now has of green roofs for a city with a downtown population of 65,000.
Community discussion of rising crime rates sought to avoid a government- or police-operated system of cameras. The Lancaster Community Safety Coalition (LCSC) was registered with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a nonprofit in 2004 to carry out the implementation and operation of a video surveillance system. Paid LCSC staff are background checked by the FBI and trained to monitor the network of 164 closed-circuit TV cameras in the city of Lancaster.

In 2009, the LCSC's expansion from a 70 to a 165 camera network attracted national attention. The national attention led to people asking to end the system. MSNBC commentator Keith Olbermann used the story in his 'Worst Person in the World' segment, "calling out the 'citizen patriots of Lancaster, Pennsylvania' and criticizing them for spying on each other". The surveillance system was also featured on ABC's "Nightline" and "CBS Evening News".

Although public opinion was initially mixed among Lancaster residents, statistical and anecdotal data suggest that the network of cameras is achieving the desired effect. In the fall of 2010, the Lancaster Community Safety Coalition was among several factors credited for a 13.7% drop in Lancaster's violent crime rate according to the FBI's Unified Crime Report (UCR). Property crime dropped 7.1% during the same period. Neighboring cities have not experienced similar reductions in crime. Although in the year 2010, cameras only helped solve 28 of the 6,653 crimes committed in the city in the year 2010. Although the year of 2009 received a reduction in violent crimes of over 13% and recorded 465 violent offenses, the following year of 2010 saw a rise in violent offenses. Violent offenses jumped from 465 in 2009 to 511 in 2010. Lancaster Community Safety Coalition had a success rate of preventing and helping police catch a suspect in .037% of crimes committed and Lancaster has more unsolved homicides since the installation of the cameras.

The Red Rose Transit Authority (RRTA) provides local bus transit to Lancaster City as well as surrounding areas in Lancaster County. RRTA is headquartered outside the City of Lancaster.

Bieber Trailways (formerly Capitol Trailways) provides intercity bus transit from the Lancaster Train and Bus Station to King of Prussia, Philadelphia, and New York City to the east, and York and Harrisburg to the west.

Amtrak also serves the Lancaster Train and Bus Station, located on the northernmost edge of the city at 53 East McGovern Avenue. The "Pennsylvanian", with service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, as well as the "Keystone Service", which runs from Harrisburg to New York via Philadelphia, both serve Lancaster.
The city is served by the Lancaster Airport, located six miles (10 km) north of downtown and just south of Lititz.

Lancaster is also a hub for automobile traffic, with so many major roadways passing through or around the city, including US-30, US-222, PA-283, PA-72, and PA-272.

The city of Lancaster hosts several museums that preserve its important contributions to society. The Demuth Museum is located in the former home of a well-known Lancaster painter named Charles Demuth. Additional art museums include the Lancaster Museum of Art and the Philips Museum of Art on the campus of Franklin & Marshall College. Art students at the state-of-the-art Pennsylvania College of Art and Design present their works at the academy's gallery that is open to the public. Another newly constructed museum, completed in 2007, is the Lancaster County Quilts and Textile Museum that celebrates the hand-sewn quilts and other textile items produced by the region's Amish and Mennonite communities. Lancaster also possesses two other museums showing Pennsylvania Dutch heritage with the Lancaster Mennonite Historical Society Museum and the Heritage Center Museum. Children can have a hands-on experience with educational learning at the Hands-on House, also known as Children's Museum of Lancaster. Nature and geology-minded visitors can view the more earthly exhibits of the Louise Arnold Tanger Arboretum and the North Museum of Natural History and Science. Upon completion, the Lancaster County Convention Center will incorporate the Stevens and Smith Historic Site, a museum that will include the preserved home of Thaddeus Stevens and his confidante Lydia Hamilton Smith.
Education in Lancaster is provided by many private and public institutions. The School District of Lancaster runs the city's public schools. The local high school campuses are McCaskey and McCaskey East. Established in 1836, it is the second oldest school district in Pennsylvania. Lancaster Catholic High School was founded in 1926. It currently falls under the jurisdiction of the diocese of Harrisburg. With a P-12 enrollment of more than 500 students, Lancaster Country Day School is one of the region's largest independent nonsectarian schools. Founded in 1908 as the Shippen School for Girls, the school later became coeducational.

Lancaster area hosts several colleges and universities including: Consolidated School of Business, Franklin & Marshall College, Lancaster General College of Nursing & Health Sciences, Lancaster Theological Seminary, Lancaster Bible College, Pennsylvania College of Art and Design, Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology, Millersville University of Pennsylvania, Central Pennsylvania College,and the Harrisburg Area Community College.

The Eurasian Union () is a possible future economic organization whose members would be Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and other countries from Europe and Asia, such as, for example, countries that were once part of the USSR.

The idea was suggested in October 2011 by the Prime Minister of Russia, Vladimir Putin, but the idea was first proposed by the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, in a speech, in 1994, in Moscow. On 18 November 2011, the presidents of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia signed an agreement in which they agreed to create the Eurasian Union by 2015. The agreement talked about the membership of candidate states and created the Eurasian Commission (which is based on the European Commission) and the Eurasian Economic Space, which will both start work on 1 January 2012.

In July, editing restrictions were placed on at the end of this discussion 

Since then, he continued to copy and paste articles into userspace and expected Barras to review them. There have been many discussions about deletion or moving complex chemistry articles fron namespace back into userspace. He has tended to look for ways to skirt any restrictions. Recently, rather than creating new pages as copies from En (restricted), he's been copying section from En into already existing articles. The most recent was Mormonism, which was a 100%, not one char changed, copy. Sometimes they are locations and therefore not too complex, but often they are not. See University of Virginia, Glucose, Nuclear proliferation and Oblate spheroid as just some examples.

Although strictly speaking copying and pasting just a "section" might be considered legalistically different from the above restrictions, I don't think it is in practice. His edits have followed a consistent pattern. He seems not to understand that copying and pasting is a problem. He seems to be encouraging/supporting others (Jonayo) to copy-paste from En as well. RP also shows essentially no interest in simplifying the long backlog of complex copied articles he has created.

I'd like to ask administrators to consider either enforcing the editing restrictions if they are still in place, or putting them back in place if they are not. This editor is disruptive, and just as a reminder, has already been banned on En. I'll leave this to the admins and try to remove myself from any further discussion at this point unless asked a direct question.

Electronic gear shifting

In 1861, Pirren Michaux invented the first bicycle with pedals. Since that time, bicycles changed a lot. The first gear-shiftable bicycle was constructed at the beginning of 20th century. You could choose from 2 speeds. It's not big deal nowadays, but then it was huge progress.

Standard system gearing up or down is provided all its way by bowdens. A bowden is special kind of wound-steel cable, which connects levers with the shifter, derailleur or brakes. As we pull or tap a lever, the bowden reacts at the same time. That causes the bicycle to change gear.

Electronic shifting works a little like that, but there are no bowdens. The system is digital. That means no wound-steel cable, but multiple combinations of 0 and 1 provides shifting. A battery placed under the frame powers the whole system. A battery should last for 1000km (depending on the manufacturer), then it needs to be recharged. Wires for data and powering are hidden inside the frame. Parts of the shifting systems are connected together and are powered by the battery. Shifting is done by servomotors. The shifter and derailleur have a pair of servomotors built inside. A microchip in the derailleur gives us freedom. It is self-adjustable. It has its own logic, which keeps the chain from dropping. There is no need of maintenance, because the derailleur adjusts itself, thanks to a microchip.

Languages of Canada

Lots of languages are used in Canada. English and French are used by most Canadians. Only New Brunswick uses both English and French as its official languages. Quebec's official language is French. English and French are recognized by the Constitution of Canada as "official languages." This means that all laws of the federal government are in both English and French and that federal government services can be available in both languages.

Many Canadians believe that the relationship between the English and French languages is important. 

To know how many people speak them, Canada's census collects a lot of kinds of information not collected in most other countries, including home language, mother tongue, first official language and language of work.

People speak other languages. About 18% of Canadians (about 6.1 million people, most are immigrants) have a language other than English or French as their first language or mother tongue. Nearly 3.5 million Canadians continue to use their other language most often, like when at home or in social settings. The biggest ones are Italian, German, Chinese, Punjabi, Arabic and Dutch.

Canada also has many native languages. But they are not spoken by many people (less than one percent of Canada), and fewer people speak them every year.

Underground Railroad

The Underground Railroad was a secret network of routes and safe houses used by black slaves in the United States to escape to free states and Canada with the help of abolitionists and those who had sympathy to their cause. The term is also applied to the abolitionists, both black and white, free and enslaved, who helped the slaves. Other various routes led to Mexico or overseas. Created in the early 1800s, the Underground Railroad was at its biggest between 1850 and 1860. One statistic suggests that by 1850, 100,000 slaves had escaped by the "Railroad". British North America, where slavery was not allowed, was a popular stopping point, as its long border gave many points of access. More than 30,000 people were said to have escaped there using the network at its best, although U.S. Census statistics shows only 6,000. The Underground Railroad fugitives' stories are recorded in the Underground Railroad Records.

Brick Lane

Brick Lane is a street in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, in the East End of London. It is part of an old area which includes Bethnal Green, Whitechapel, Spitalfields and Petticoat Lane.

Today, it is the heart of the city's British Bangladeshi community and is known to some as "Banglatown". It is famous for its many curry houses. It has a most interesting history.

Brick Lane gets its name from former brick and tile manufacture, using the local brick earth deposits, that began in the 15th century. 

Successive waves of immigration began with Huguenot refugees spreading from Spitalfields, where the master weavers were based, in the 17th century. This started a connection with clothing which lasted for over three centuries. 

The Huguenots were followed by Irish, Ashkenazi Jews and, in the last century, Bangladeshis. The area became a centre for weaving, tailoring and the clothing industry, due to the abundance of semi- and unskilled immigrant labour. 

Brewing came to Brick Lane before 1680, with water drawn from deep wells. One brewer was Joseph Truman, first recorded in 1683. His family went on to establish the sizable Black Eagle Brewery on Brick Lane.

The Brick Lane Market was developed in the 17th century for fruit and vegetables. The Sunday market, like the ones on Petticoat Lane and nearby Columbia Road, dates from a dispensation given to the Jewish community. The Brick Lane Farmers' Market opened 6th June 2010.

Emma Elizabeth Smith was viciously assaulted and robbed in Osborn Street, the part of Brick Lane that meets Whitechapel High Street, in the early hours of 3 April 1888. It was one of the first of the eleven Whitechapel Murders, some of which were attributed to the serial killer, Jack the Ripper.

In 1742, La Neuve Eglise, a Huguenot chapel, was built on the corner of Brick Lane and Fournier Street. By 1809, it had become The Jews’ Chapel, for promoting Christianity to the expanding Jewish population, and became a Methodist Chapel in 1819 (John Wesley having preached his first covenant sermon at the nearby Black Eagle Street Chapel). In 1898, the building was consecrated as the Machzikei HaDath, or Spitalfields Great Synagogue. In 1976, it became the London Jamme Masjid (Great London). The building is Grade II* listed. Many Bangladeshi immigrants to Brick Lane were from the Greater Sylhet region. These settlers helped shape Bangladeshi migration to Britain; families from Jagannathpur and Bishwanath tend to dominate in the Brick Lane area today.

Valve Hammer Editor

Valve Hammer Editor, which used to be called Worldcraft and is now often called Hammer, is Valve Corporation's map creation program for their game engine, Source. Worldcraft was originally made for "Quake" and "Quake II", but is now used on other games such as "Half-Life 2", "" and "Left 4 Dead 2".

In September 1996, Ben Morris created and released the original Worldcraft as a tool for making custom Quake maps. On July 14, 1997, Valve hired Ben Morris and started to use Worldcraft in "Half-Life".

After opening an existing map or new map you can see four windows. It's divided into four views. View from top, front, side, and the resulting 3D view. When you do something in one window you can see result in others. The program offers this tool's:
Selection tool is used for selecting and manipulation with objects.
Entity tool is collection of objects from door after spawn place.
Block tool is basic item to create box, wall, floor and nearly all.
Toggle texture application is of course helper with coloring and texturing objects.
Clipping tool with them we can cut objects.
At the last important tool is Vertex tool. It spread item and we can manipulate and edit individual parts.

But this is tools are only static. We often need create dynamic objects. Breakable window, openable doors, elevators, moving objects etc. On this is used tool "Tie of entity". This tool has many useful options. Class is main choice of type function. Here we can setup almost important options. Bookmarks: Output and Input are option, how object will respond to neighthood.

When we save map, it have suffix vmf. This format which is openable for next edit but it isn't playable. We must compiling map to format nav but it isn't openable in hammer editor. In compiling option is the most important Additional game parameters. If we haven't original version, we must write parameter –steam. Without this we can't open and play our map.
it's important know in which game will be map open. In bookmark tools/options are loaded library with textures etc. And when we can play map in some others game, the game doesn't find it. So we need load into hammer correct library.

Svitavy (German: "Zwittau") is a town, situated on the border of Czech and Moravia. About 17 thousand people lives there. Through the city flows small river, rather just a creek, called Svitava, which has spring nearby the city. 

1) A little bit of history
The original settlement with church was founded by monks from Litomyšl and called it by the flowing river Svitava, a little later started coming here German settlers, who founded a new village with a church St.Giles, original Svitava slowly merged with the new village. The area around Svitavy became the subject of conflict between the bishop of Olomouc and monastic manor from Litomyšl, 1256 conflict was settled in favor of the Bishop of Olomouc. So the year 1256 started the history of our town. In 2006 we celebrated 750 year from the foundation of town Svitavy.

2) Famous people in Svitavy
The first person is Viktor Felber. He was born on 11th October. He was profesor of ČVUT in Prague in 1930 - 1931. There is also street named after him, where is primary school and playground.

The second and moreless more famous people is Oskar Schindler.

Sunset Boulevard

Sunset Boulevard is a long road in west Los Angeles. It stretches 24 miles (39 km) from Figueroa Street in downtown (central) Los Angeles to the Pacific Coast Highway in Pacific Palisades at the Pacific Ocean. Part of the Boulevard, called Sunset Strip, passes through Hollywood.

The boulevard is at least four lanes in width for all of the route. Car accidents are not uncommon due to the lack of a central divider on most sections. Also, it has tricky curves and blind crests. 

Sunset often has traffic far beyond its design capacity. It is worn, and has cracks and potholes. Traffic on Sunset is often slow-moving, especially during the rush hour. But when traffic is mild, Sunset is a fast thoroughfare because it has few (and short timed) traffic lights in the western part. Even at rush hours, traffic generally flows well, as the lights are well spaced and timed.

This is the 1½ mile (2.4) km strip running through West Hollywood. The Strip is well-known; it has boutiques, restaurants, and nightclubs that are part of the entertainment industry. It is also known for its trademark array of huge, colorful billboards and is a 'hangout' for rock stars, movie stars and other entertainers.

Sunset Strip was the location of a popular tv show "77 Sunset Strip" (1958–1964), starring Ephrem Zimbalist Jnr. Many young stars made an appearance in the series.

Sunset Boulevard gave its name to a famous 1950 film of the same name, starring Gloria Swanson, William Holden and Eric von Stroheim.

3D television

The function of 3D television is making a two-dimensional screen look like its picture is in three-dimensions. This effect starts when we observe two shifted displays.

Basic division of 3d technologies

3D televisions in shops and e-shops are in 90% of cases stereoscopic so we have to use the glasses. The glasses divide display into two components (either shifted in color or otherwise).

If we want these two components to work, we need the 3D transmitter in our TV. It is very important for glasses because we need the perfect quality and synchronization. 

3D TV can do anything as well as our classic 2D TV but can also play movies in 3D format. The newest types of TV even can convert 2D into 3D but the quality is low.

Movies in 3D format are still scarce and few people would invest their money into partially exploited machine. And here is the question if is better to buy 3D TV today or wait.

If we want to enjoy the best 3D image from television, it’s good to get a larger diagonal.

For 3D TV, one thing is important. If we are closer to the screen, the experience is stronger. Three-dimensional image processing is also more difficult for our brains.

Because the observation of 3D space in a 3D TV is so hard, viewers should be sitting during the watching 3D TV.

The Black Cauldron is a fantasy novel written by Lloyd Alexander. It was published in 1965 as the second book in The Chronicles of Prydain series. "The Black Cauldron" was awarded a Newbery Honor. "The Black Cauldron" centers around Taran, an Assistant Pig-Keeper who lives in the fantasy land of Prydain.

The book begins with a meeting of many leaders. They make plans to stop the evil Arawn from taking over Prydain. The leaders decide to steal the Black Cauldron, a powerful tool, from Arawn. Prince Gwydion, the war lord of Prydain, leads a band of people into Annuvin, Arawn's country. When there, they learn that the cauldron has already been stolen. The Fair Folk (fairies) tell the group that the witches of Morva stole the cauldron. Prince Ellidyr, a poor youngest son, sneaks away from the group so that he can steal the cauldron for himself. The rest of the group follows to save him from Arawn's soldiers, but are attacked themselves. In the battle, Fflewddur Fflam and Doli are separated from the group. Also, Adaon, son of the chief bard, is wounded very badly. Before he dies, he passes on a brooch to Taran. The brooch has magical powers and Taran uses it to find Fflewddur and Doli. They continue to Morva, where Taran trades the brooch for the cauldron. The group then tries to smash it, but the witches tell them it can only be destroyed when a living person dies in it willingly. On the way back, Ellidyr attacks the group and steals the cauldron. The group is later found by King Morgant and his men, who have captured Ellidyr and beaten him. Morgant plans to use the cauldron to rule Prydain. Morgant ties up the entire group and offers to free them if Taran will join his service. While they are talking, Doli turns invisible and frees the whole group. During the fight that follows, Ellidyr throws himself into the cauldron, destroying it. King Smoit then comes and attacks Morgant, killing him. The group is rescued.

Nokia E7 is establish for managers, and people, who need a luxury diary and need organize their time.
Working people appreciate an email client, calendar, office, which contains office word, excel and powerpoint, pdf reader and a lot of another apps.
Phone can connect to the internet by 3G, EDGE or WiFi. Of course for connection with computer or another phone is Bluetooth installed in.
In this phone, there is installed gps receiver SIRF3. And Nokia gives you Ovi maps for using navigation. Ovi maps are free for people, who has Nokia phone. By Ovi market you can download every maps of state on the World. In Ovi market, there is a lot of applications, which you can download. Many of them are free.

The operation system in Nokia E7 is Symbian^3. This is the latest operation system of Symbian. This system automatically updates your phone, but it needs constantly connection to the internet for using all equipment and apps.

The phone is equip of 8Mpx camera. This is less than camera in Nokia N8. This step made Nokia, because they had less space to insert the camera chip. The chip with autofocus in Nokia N8 is too big, so they used smaller chip with fixedfocus. For making video is this camera sufficient. Recording video is in HD resolution and makes 25 slides per second. 
Qwerty keyboard is awesome. Writing on it is like writing on the laptop. Ultimately the phone looks like small laptop, because rotation between display and keyboard is 30°.

Nokia E7 has the bigger HD display with 4" diagonal and resolution 360x640 px. Touched AMOLED display is capactive and shows 16 milien colors.

This phone is really good assistant for people. But it's size is for more people too big and price is between 9 to 13 thousand crowns. Finally I fill here a table with positives and negatives.

Earth is overcrowded, most plants and animals are extinct. The future of people is in danger, and the only hope for survival is in the distant past.

Scientists discover a way to travel to the past. They decide to send people into prehistoric times, and try to rebuild civilization and get it right this time. The group in the past calls their new home Terra Nova.

The series is about the Shannon family as they join the Tenth Pilgrimage of settlers to Terra Nova. Jim Shannon, the father, guides his family through this new world. Jim’s wife, Elisabeth, is a surgeon and the newest addition to Terra Nova’s medical team. Josh is their 17 year old son who is torn by having to leave life as he knows it behind. Upon arriving at the settlement, he finds himself instantly drawn to the beautiful and rule-breaking Skye. Maddy, Josh’s 15 years old sister, hopes Terra Nova will give her a chance to reinvent herself.

Upon the Shannons’ arrival, they are introduced to Commander Nathaniel Taylor, the first settler and leader of the Terra Nova. Taylor warns the travelers that while Terra Nova is a place of new opportunities and fresh beginnings, all is not as idyllic as it initially appears. Along with blue skies, towering waterfalls and lush vegetation, the surrounding terrain is teeming with danger – and not just of the man-eating dinosaur variety. There is also a splinter colony of renegades lead by Mira, who is opposed to Taylor and his leadership.

Even more threatening than what lies outside the protective walls of the colony is the chilling possibility that something sinister is happening inside Terra Nova. The Shannons will come to suspect that not everyone on this mission has the same idea of how to best save humanity.

Fly fishing

Fly fishing is a way of sport fishing. Bait (an artificial fly) is cast into the hunting area with a fly line and fly-fishing rod. This way, the fisherman or woman can catch a lot of fish, both freshwater and marine. Fly fishermen and women use special equipment, such as fly-fishing rod, fly-fishing reel, fly-fishing line, and pitfalls, which are made from natural or synthetic sling materials.

Fly fishing probably began in ancient Egypt, but its modern form goes all the way back to the England of the second half of the 19th century. The local fishermen caught fish with live and later artificial insects. This method began to spread to the rest of Europe. National and international competitions and championships were started. This has brought fly fishing to the attention of the public. 

Lake fly fishing is done on backwaters and mostly on reservoirs, ponds and lakes. The actual hunt is done either from the bank or from the water, by fording or with the help of vessels like ships.

River fly fishing is usually done in flowing waters. It is normally done by fording. The fisherman or woman stands in the water dressed in special waders and wading boots. Fishing from the bank is also possible but it is not done very often. 

Sea fly fishing is done by fording as well as fishing from a boat.

Dry fly fishing is done with a floating line. The bait floats on the water. The fly often looks like hatched insects or other food on the water surface.

Wet fly fishing is done with all types of fly-fishing lines. The fly is underwater and looks like drowned or newly hatched insects. 

Streamer fishing is mostly done with sinking fly lines. The flies look like insects or other organisms.

Nymph fishing is done with all types of fly-fishing lines. The flies look like young insects.

Fly-fishing rod is a kind of fishing rod which is designed only for fly fishing. Its purpose is to give enough power to the fly-fishing line, which carries an artificial fly to the hunting area. 

The fly-fishing line moves an artificial fly to the place of casting. It is only supposed to be used for fly fishing and with the fly-fishing rod and fly-fishing reel. It is not suitable for other ways of fly fishing because it would be damaged.

The fly-fishing reel is used for storing and backing the fly-fishing line. The fly line is stored in a coil. This coil revolves around its vertical axis in the reel. The fly-fishing line is reeled by moving the coil. The coil is secured with a handle.

Merkava

The Merkava is a main battle tank. It is developed and produced in Israel for the Israel Defense Forces. The tank was first introduced in 1978 and it was first used in combat during the 1982 Lebanon War. Four main versions have been developed. These are called Merkava Mark I – Mark IV.
When designing the Merkava tank, everything was subordinated to the survival aspect of the crew, the engine is placed in front of the tank and thus serve as an additional component of ballistic protection, while the crew can escape from the damaged Merkava door at the rear of the tank. The thick armor and high mobility is one of the best protected tanks in the world. The design team that developed the first version of this tank, led by commander of the Israeli armored corps, Israel Tal.
The Mark I weighed 63 tons. It had 900 horsepowers and maximum speed was 46 km/h. It was armed with 105 millimeter M64 main gun, M68 was later installed. Coaxially with the main gun was mounted 7.62 mm machine gun and on the turret were moutnted two more 7.62 mm machine guns, and a 60 mm mortar mounted externally.
The Mark II was almost same as the Mark I. The main differences were internal mortar, better mobility and better resistance.
The Mark III weighed 65 tons. It had 1200 horsepowers and maximum speed was 60 km/h. It was armed with 120 millimeter MG251 main gun. Other equipment was almost same as the Mark II. The Mark III was longer and had better armor than the Mark II, and were added some new systems such as fire-control system.
The Mark IV weigh 65 tons. It has 1500 horsepowers and maximum speed is over 60 km/h. The Mark IV is armed with 120 millimeter MG253 main gun using an electrical semi-automatic revolving magazine for 10 rounds. Coaxially with the main gun is mounted machine gun and on the turret is moutnted one more machine gun operated from inside the tank, and internally mounted 60 mm mortar. Mark IV has the new fire-control system enables shoot down helicopters, upgraded tracks, digital battlefield management system, and other.
One tank (Mark I) was donated to the Prague Military Technical Museum (Czech Republic), which has mobile machine one museum in the world outside Israel.

Mining in Kutná Hora

In the Middle Ages, Kutná Hora belonged to one of the most important cities in the Bohemian Kingdom. The silver mining started in the second half of 13th century. Unfortunately, the exact date and place, where it all started, remains unknown. Because of that there are lots of legends about the discovery of silver. The most common legend tells a story of a monk named Anthony from the monastery in Sedlec. According to this legend 
the monk found out three silver rods at the foot of the hill.

The peak of mining in Kutná Hora was reached in 14th century. During ages there were lots of mines, but only few of them have been preserved. Last mine was closed during 17th century.

Mines were formed by shafts – pits going underground. Their depth varied from 20 to 150 metres. 

Miners worked with simple tools. Only 50 dm3 of rock were extracted within a six-hour shift. This technology allowed them to reach depths ranging from 400 to 450 metres in 14th century. The deepest mine in 16th century was the Osel (donkey) mine, which reached the depth of 600 metres.

Mine was discovered in 1967 during a hydro-geological exploration of the heart of the city. Originally it was thought that the legendary Osel mine had been discovered. But further exploration proved that it is St. George mine.

The mine was established around 1330’s and remained operational until the end of 15th or beginning of 16th century.

Nowadays visitors may see 250 meters long tunnel, but in total there more than 800m of stopes, drifts or corridors. During those 250 meters it’s possible to see several interesting areas. Such as drifts to other levels of mine, exploration drifts, partly flooded stope, fragments of wooden drainage or wooden props (protection against collapsing of ceiling).

<doc id="316607" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316607" title="Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan">
Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan

The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR; ) was the first successful attempt to establish a democratic and secular republic in the Muslim world (before the Republic of Turkey). The ADR was founded on May 28, 1918 after the collapse of the Russian Empire that began with the Russian Revolution of 1917 by the Azerbaijani National Council in Tiflis, Georgia. Its borders were with Russia in the north, Democratic Republic of Georgia in the north-west, Democratic Republic of Armenia in the west, and Persian Empire (Iran) in the south. It had a population of 2 million. Ganja was the temporary capital of the Republic as Baku, which is the de jure capital, was under Bolshevik control.

Under the ADR, a the government was a parliamentary system in which a parliament, called the Milli Majlis (National Assembly of Azerbaijan) elected on the basis of universal, free, and proportional representation, was the highest political institution of state authority and the Council of Ministers was responsible before it. Fatali Khan Khoyski became its first prime minister. Besides the political party Musavat who had the majority in parliament, other political parties were Ehrar, Ittihad, Muslim Social-democrats as well as representatives of Armenian (21 out of 120 seats), Russian, Polish, Jewish and German minorities gained seats in the parliament. Some members supported Pan-Islamist and Pan-Turkist ideologies.

Among the important accomplishments of the parliament was to give women the right to vote, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim nation to give women equal political rights with men. Apart from this accomplishment, Azerbaijan made these reforms earlier than the United Kingdom and the United States. Another important accomplishment of ADR was the establishment of Baku State University, which was the first modern-type university founded in Azerbaijan.

By March 1920, it became clear that Soviet Russia would attack and invade Azerbaijan. The Soviet Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin said that the invasion was justified by the fact that Soviet Russia could not survive without the Baku oil fields, which was at that time the largest oil field in the world with more than half of the world's oil reserves. According to the common opinion in Moscow, Russian Bolsheviks were to "help" the Baku proletariat (workers) in overthrowing the "counter-revolutionary nationalists", meaning the government and the state of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.

After a major political crisis, the Fifth Cabinet of Ministers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic resigned on April 1, 1920. On April 25, 1920, the Soviet Russian 11th Red Army crossed into Azerbaijan, entering Baku on April 27. They demanded the closing of the Azerbaijani parliament and set up their own Bolshevik government headed by Nariman Narimanov. To avoid bloodshed, the members of parliament had to agree with the demand and the ADR officially ended on April 28, 1920, giving way to the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (Azerbaijan SSR) as its successor state. The Red Army met very little resistance in Baku from the Azerbaijani army, which was tied up on the Karabakh front. The first Communist government of Azerbaijan consisted almost entirely of native Azerbaijanis from the left-wing political factions of the "Hummat" and "Adalat" political parties.

In May 1920, there was a major rebellion against the occupying Soviet Russian 11th Red Army in Ganja, who wanted to restore the Musavatists to power. The rebellion was crushed by government troops by May 31. Leaders of the ADR either fled to the Democratic Republic of Georgia, which was the last independent Caucasian country that was invaded in 1921 by Soviet Russia, then to Turkey and Iran, or were captured by Bolsheviks, like Mammed Amin Rasulzade, who was later allowed to emigrate (leave the country), or were executed (killed) like Gen. Selimov, Gen. Sulkevich, Gen. Agalarov, a total of over 20 generals, or assassinated by Armenian terrorists like Fatali Khan Khoyski and Behbudagha Javanshir. Most students and citizens travelling abroad remained in those countries never to return again to their country. Other important ADR military leaders like the former Minister of Defense General Samedbey Mehmandarov and deputy defense minister General Ali-Agha Shikhlinski (who was called "the God of Artillery" ) were at first arrested, but then released two months later thanks to efforts of Nariman Narimanov. Gen. Mehmandarov and Gen. Shikhlinsky spent their last years teaching in the Azerbaijan SSR military school.

In the end, "the Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918-20 quickly or easily. As many as 20,000 died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest." However, the founding of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic was made easier by the fact that there was a certain popular support for Bolshevik ideology in Azerbaijan, among the industrial workers in Baku.

<doc id="316622" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316622" title="Thunderstorm">
Thunderstorm

Thunderstorms are small, weather systems that make strong winds, heavy rain, lightning, and thunder. Thunderstorms can happen anywhere with two conditions: the air near the Earth's surface must be warm and moist (with lots of liquid), and the atmosphere must be . 100 lightning bolts hit the earth every second, and at any one moment, about 1,800 thunderstorms happen around the earth.

Usually there are more clouds in the afternoon than in early morning. This is because the ground has warmed up enough by the afternoon for strong winds to blow upward from the ground (these winds are called "updrafts"). If there is very little moisture, an updraft has to go much higher before the water vapor condenses into a cloud. Sometimes the air can rise up as high as 5,000 to 10,000 feet (1,524 to 3,048 m) before a small cumulus cloud can condense from the invisible water vapor.

High, puffy little clouds do not change until a lot of moisture is added. This moisture helps the updraft. Moisture can add heat, which means the cloud will warm up inside and go up even faster. The moisture makes the cumulus cloud "mushroom" upwards and turn into a tall cumulus cloud. The winds inside this cloud are very strong. Thunder and lightning begins when the top of the cloud is 25,000 feet (7,280 m) high. The inside of the cloud is, by this time, cold enough so that the water drops are turned into ice crystals. A cumulus cloud stops growing when it hits the warm stratosphere. Some thunderstorms grow twice as high as Mount Everest!

Strong upper winds in the stratosphere smooth and spread the top of the cloud. This make the cloud look like the top of a mushroom or an anvil. The ice crystals in the anvil cloud give it a fuzzy look. As a thunderstorm grows, water drops or ice crystals inside the cloud hit and mix with each other, getting bigger. The bottom of the cloud grows dark with water about to fall. When the drops become so heavy that the winds inside the cloud cannot keep them up any more, they fall from the cloud as rain or hail. Even as they fall the water drops grow by mixing with the smaller drops, and makes big raindrops. Hail becomes bigger inside the cloud. One thunderstorm cloud usually runs out of energy in about 30 to 50 minutes. But supercell thunderstorms can last for hours until they dissipate by outflow.

Thunderstorms are very active electrically. Lightning is a large electrical that happens between two opposite charged surfaces.

When lightning strikes, energy is let out. This energy moves to the air and makes air spread quickly and send out sound waves. Thunder is the sound that comes from the rapid spread of air along the lightning strike. Thunder is slower than lightning, because light is faster than sound.

Only about 10% of thunderstorms are thought severe. Severe thunderstorms cause high winds of more than , hail, flash floods, and tornadoes. Hailstorms damage crops, damage the metal on cars, and break windows. Sudden flash floods that happen because of heavy rains is the biggest reason for weather-related deaths.

Lightning, which happens with all thunderstorms, makes thousands of forest fires each year in the United States. Lightning also kills or injures hundreds of people a year in the United States.

Regular thunderstorms begin when warm air near the ground mix with moist air, which makes an updraft (a wind that goes upward). A severe thunderstorm needs a strong "up"draft and a strong "down"draft. A strong updraft is made when, firstly, the ground is very warm; secondly, when the air is very moist; and thirdly, the air above is very cold. When the updraft gets stronger, so does the thunderstorm.

Flash floods happen when slow-moving thunderstorms pour down much more water than usual in a small area. It rains so hard that the water can not soak into the ground fast enough, and the water rushes down the mountainsides or hills into streams and rivers. These streams and rivers cannot carry all the water, so it quickly floods. The most severe flash flood makes the water level rise dangerously in streams, dry places, or canyons. Flash floods can make terrible mud slides and can move very quickly. They can roll big rocks, tear out trees, and destroy buildings and bridges.

Flash floods can also happen when two or more thunderstorms hit the same spot, one right after the other. They can happen when a dam bursts open or ice breaks up. Flash floods can also happen when it rains very hard on quickly melting snow.

Thunderstorms do not do only damage, however: they can be a great help to man and all living creatures. We get lots of water for many continents during the summer. Plants receive lots of life-giving rain when they need it. Without the thunderstorms, many continents would become dry. Fish would die, crops would fail, and animals would perish.

Thunderstorms are also our natural air conditioners. Hot air at the surface rises up into the high atmosphere where it is put out into space. Clouds give us shades, and rain can cool down a hot day. Without thunderstorms, the earth would be as much as 20 F (11 C) warmer. In the summer, dust, haze, and other pollutants come together in the lower atmosphere. When the air rises, either in cumulus clouds or in thunderstorms, spreads the pollution higher up into the atmosphere. Rain from thunderstorms washes away many of these pollutants out of the air.

Lightning in thunderstorms also helps keep the electrical balance between the earth and the atmosphere. Lightning is also fertilizer. When it splits through the sky, it changes nitrogen gas in the air to nitrogen compounds. These fall to the ground and are added to the soil. Nitrogen is one of the main ingredients in fertilizer. Ten percent of the nitrogen fertilizer needed for farming is made by lightning.

So, even though thunderstorms are dangerous, they can be a great help. They give summer water, cool the earth, and clean the air. Lightning balances the earth's electricity and helps fertilize the soil. And after a thunderstorm, sometimes there is a beautiful rainbow.

Some tips to keep safe in a thunderstorm are:

The first all-in-one PC, Macintosh was manufactured by Apple in mid-1980s. Laptops can be included into this category too.Modern all-in-one PCs don’t have a case. Everything is in the monitor. Only keyboard, mouse, printer and other connectable peripherals are outside. All-in-one PCs also integrate many add-ons, such as speakers, and wireless networking. Most of latest PCs feature touchscreen or multitouch displays which let you use two fingers at a time to pinch, push, rotate, and scroll items on screen. All-in-one PCs have almost equal parameters to desktop PCs but they are not as big as desktops so all-in-one PCs are excellent for saving space on table. The very compact size that makes them so appealing also creates heat and power limitations that usually require the use of a laptop processor and weak graphic card. Of course, all-in-one PCs offer lots of benefits. They don't require you to buy a new monitor, or to have an old one sitting around. Wall-mounting options are common, as well. On the other hand, on an all-in-one you're stuck with the screen, and the parts. You can expand a regular desktop to increase its life span, but an all-in-one PC has serious upgrade limitations. It’s because of placement of internal hardware. Everything is close together to save space. All-in-one PCs are also quite more expensive than ordinary desktops.

Hlinsko

Hlinsko is a small city in east Bohemia in the Czech Republic. It stands on the banks of the Chrudimka river, in the Bohemian-Moravian highlands on the border of the Iron Mountains. Hlinsko belongs to the Pardubice region. It has about 10 000 inhabitants. Hlinsko is about 590 meters away over the sea. 

In the 11th century, there was created a potter’s camp on the route from Bohemia to Moravia. From there is taken name of the city, which comes from the word “hlína” (clay, material used by potters). First historical remark about Hlinsko comes from first half of 14th century.

From this time, Hlinsko belongs to domination of Rychmburk, which belongs to Tas from Rychmburk, later to Vartenberk and next to Arnošt Flaška from Pardubice. In this century, city obtained reeve’s department.

There was an old merchant’s route passing through Hlinsko, which was drawed in the Klaudián’s map from year 1518. In 1718, clan Kinských bought Rychmburk’s domination.

In 1834, Hlinsko became independent on authorities. In 1850, there was created district in Hlinsko. In 1871 was finished construction of the railroad and began traffic on the road from Pardubice to Havlíčkův Brod (passing through Hlinsko).

There are many well-preserved people’s buildings in Hlinsko and its neighborhood already from half of 18th century. In part of Hlinsko it is Betlém, in neighborhood it is outdoor museum of people’s architecture in Veselý Kopec, Dřevíkov, Svobodné Hamry and Možděnice. There is camp Ležáky about 10 kilometers from Hlinsko, which was burned by Nazis during World War Two.

In modern history, Hlinsko was district city in years 1949 – 1960, after 1960 city lost benefit of district and it was integrated to Chrudimský district against will of its exponents. City became administrative centre once again in 1.1.2003 after reform of public administration, when Hlinsko became city of third level (city with extended scope).

Set of people’s buildings is on right bank of Chrudimka river. Before it was part of the city formed by timbered cottages, in which potters and tailors lived. Building material was mainly wood, wall was only in part around heater.
In 1995, Betlém was declared as monumental reservation of people’s architecture.
Many of buildings was renewed. Visitors can look over here how people lived and what traditions they had. There take place periodical exhibitions, too.

There are expositions from history of Hlinsko district in museum. Visitors can find here a memorial hall of Adámků’s family, learn about history of education, crafting… They can see examples of contemporary suits and fashion accessories. There is permanent exposition of reliefs from Karel Lidický, and an exhibition of images. Name of this exhibition is “Výtvarné Hlinecko” and some of exhibited images are borrowed from National gallery.


For cultural self-realization is there cinema and theater.
For book lovers is there Hlinsko’s library, which has two sections: child’s and adult’s.
City’s cultural club Hlinečan offers a wide spectrum of theater shows, concerts, lectures and social actions for inhabitants of Hlinsko and its region. They are organized in Chamber theatre or in local Sokol house.
Every year there are organized Adámek’s folklore celebrations. There are concerned groups not only from Czech republic, but also from abroad. Groups Vysočan and Vysočánek are representing Hlinsko.
Hlinsko produce Hlinsko’s news, which appears every month.
City has also its own TV – Cable’s information service.

The biggest companies in Hlinsko:





Children from Hlinsko can attend three nursery schools. Next they can study at one of three primary schools (Ležáků, Smetanova, Resslova). There is also a special school for children with defects in writing, reading or counting.
There is also one secondary grammar school, Karel Václav Rais’s in Hlinsko. It offers four-year and eight-year study.
Parents can sign on their children to art school. It offers education in most artistic disciplines.

In city stadium with grassy playground there is possible to practice summer sports. It is possible to use covered swimming pool with sauna.
In winter, friends of ice-skating and ice-hockey can use winter stadium or ski lifts, running tracks and hills for sledging.

<doc id="316675" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316675" title="Sacagawea">
Sacagawea

Sacagawea (c. 1788 – probably December 20, 1812; was a Lemhi Shoshone woman, who went along with the Lewis and Clark Expedition as an interpreter and guide. Lewis and Clark explored the Western United States with her, travelling thousands of miles from North Dakota to the Pacific Ocean between 1804 and 1806. 
Sacagawea is well remembered today. When many people think about Lewis and Clark today, they also think about Sacagawea.

In 2000, the United States Mint issued the Sacagawea dollar coin in her honor, showing Sacagawea and her son, Jean Baptiste Charbonneau. The face on the coin was made to look like a modern Shoshone-Bannock woman named Randy'L He-dow Teton. This was because nobody knows exactly what Sacagawea looked like.

In 2001, she was given the title of Honorary Sergeant, Regular Army, by President Bill Clinton.

Not much is known for sure about Sacagawea.

At about thirteen years of age, Sacagawea was taken as a wife by Toussaint Charbonneau, a Quebecer trapper living in the village. He had also taken another young Shoshone named Otter Woman as a wife. 

Sacagawea was pregnant with her first child when the Corps of Discovery arrived near the Hidatsa villages to spend the winter of 1804–05. Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark built Fort Mandan. They interviewed several trappers who might be able to interpret or guide the expedition up the Missouri River in the springtime. They agreed to hire Charbonneau as an interpreter when they discovered his wife spoke Shoshone, as they knew they would need the help of Shoshone tribes at the headwaters of the Missouri. 

Lewis wrote in his journal on November 4, 1804: 
Charbonneau and Sacagawea moved into the expedition's fort a week later. Clark nicknamed her Janey. Lewis wrote about the birth of Jean Baptiste Charbonneau on February 11, 1805.

In April, the expedition left Fort Mandan and headed up the Missouri River in "pirogues". They had to be poled against the current and sometimes pulled from the riverbanks. On May 14, 1805, Sacagawea rescued items that had fallen out of a capsized boat, including the journals and records of Lewis and Clark. The corps commanders, who praised her quick action, named the Sacagawea River in her honor on May 20.

By August 1805, the corps had found a Shoshone tribe and was trying to trade for horses to cross the Rocky Mountains. They used Sacagawea to interpret and discovered that the tribe's chief was her brother "Cameahwait".

Lewis recorded their reunion in his journal:
And Clark in his:
The Shoshone agreed to trade horses to the group, and to provide guides to lead them over the cold and barren Rocky Mountains. The trip was so hard that they were had to eat candles just to live. When they went down into the more temperate regions on the other side, Sacagawea helped to find and cook camas roots to help them get their strength back.

As the expedition approached the mouth of the Columbia River on the Pacific Coast, Sacagawea gave up her beaded belt to let the captains trade for a fur robe they wanted to give to President Thomas Jefferson. 

On the trip back, they came near the Rocky Mountains in July 1806. On July 6, Clark wrote "The Indian woman informed me that she had been in this plain frequently and knew it well... She said we would discover a gap in the mountains in our direction..." which is now Gibbons Pass. A week later, on July 13, Sacagawea told Clark to cross into the Yellowstone River basin at what is now known as Bozeman Pass. This was later chosen as the best route for the Northern Pacific Railway to cross the continental divide.

While Sacagawea has been thought of as a guide for the expedition, she probably only gave directions a few times. Her work as an interpreter certainly helped the party to talk with the Shoshone. However, the most important thing she did for the group may have been being there during the hard journey, which showed they did not want to attack any Native Americans they came across. While traveling through what is now Franklin County, Washington, Clark noted, "The Indian woman confirmed those people of our friendly intentions, as no woman ever accompanies a war party of Indians in this quarter," and, "the wife of Shabono our interpeter we find reconsiles all the Indians, as to our friendly intentions a woman with a party of men is a token of peace."

After the expedition, Charbonneau and Sacagawea spent three years among the Hidatsa before accepting William Clark's invitation to live in St. Louis, Missouri in 1809. 

Sacagawea gave birth to a daughter, Lizette, sometime after 1810. According to Bonnie "Spirit Wind-Walker" Butterfield, historical documents say that Sacagawea died in 1812 of an unknown sickness: 

As further proof that Sacagawea died in 1812, Butterfield writes:
"An adoption document made in the Orphans Court Records in St. Louis, Missouri states, 'On August 11, 1813, William Clark became the guardian of 'Tousant Charbonneau, a boy about ten years, and Lizette Charbonneau, a girl about one year old.' For a Missouri State Court at the time, to designate a child as orphaned and to allow an adoption, both parents had to be confirmed dead in court papers."

Australasia was the name of a combined team of athletes from Australia and New Zealand. They competed together at the 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics. When the Olympic Games started up again in 1920 after World War I, the two countries sent separate teams to the Games.

The Australasia team won a total of twelve medals in the two games in which they competed. Most of these were in swimming. One New Zealander won a medal in 1908. Harry Kerr won a bronze in athletics. In 1912, two New Zealanders won medals. Malcolm Champion won a gold in swimming. Tony Wilding won a bronze in tennis. All other medalists for Australasia were Australians.

Heroes of Might & Magic VI is a computer game issued by Ubisoft. It was released in October. The game is the sixth episode of a series.

Game play is turn-based strategy. It is animated. The story continues from the previous episode and is basically told in the intro. You can go through it in single player. Camping is like camping in other "Heroes", just to relax.

Better than camping is of course the multiplayer and the game is made for it. You can play hot seat offline or online over internet, but be careful because if you lose connection the game is over and you can't get it back. Offline and online saves are not compatible.

The game looks like the 5th episode. Main on the game are fights and adventure part of game is put on side. Battles are beautiful, you can notice creatures are going to move even when its not their turn. The obstacles are used for cover and they give bonuses. For example there aren't resources like sulfur, diamonds or mercury and there are crystals instead. When you will go to castle it will be a surprise, because there is no castle, there is only a picture of it and you can manage your kingdom there.

Jawa Motors

Jawa started in 1927. Czechoslovak ammunition factory of František Janeček started find a new product program, because army production was stopped. František Janeček was a scientist, inventor and constructor. In Czechoslovakia was production of motorbikes only small-lot or single part, so new production program was chosen in this branch.

The name JAWA comes from the first two letters of words Janeček, name of the holder and Wanderer, name of the Austrian factory, which sold licence for first JAWA motorbike Wanderer 500 OHV.

In 1932 František Janeček presented a new motorbike, it was Jawa 175 Villiers. Licence was bought from England, from constructor G.W. Patchettem. It was simple motorbike for today using. In Czechoslovakia was very favourite for light weight. To 1935 were produced some 3000 motorbikes of this type. 
In 1935 the same frame used engine JAWA 350 OHV. This motorbike was stronger and more luxury than previous type 175 Villiers. There was more chrome parts and a built-in speedometer. 4000 motorbikes of this type were produced.

Most small and youngest motorbike of season before World War II was the Jawa 100 Robot. It was a small moped . About 12000 were produced.
In 1933 Jawa started to produce small cars. Ing. Janeček bought a licence from German Meisterklasse DKW. It was called JAWA 700. To 1934 was produced some one thousand cars of this type, because sale was full of small cars, so JAWA produced more motorbikes than cars, in season before war were motorbikes more favourite.
The start of World War II meant the end of motorbike production. Lots of motorbikes projects was created illegally, but only one realized, Jawa 350 „Pérák“ After war was produce of motorbikes started again. „Pérák“ was first motorbike with Czech licence, all parts of this motorbike were from Czechoslovakia. It was technical a technology miracle of this season. 
In 1952 was produced one of travelling motorbike Jawa 500 OHC, there was used four stroke engine. This motorbike is used by the police and the army. 
To the 1960 JAWA cooperated with many countries, for example India, Turkey, Egypt. Firm IDEAL MOTORD in Majsur in India bought licences from Jawa mostly. 

In 1970 were most produced motorbikes „BIZON“ series, and after that was created JAWA 634, which were modernized to model 640. JAWA produced a lot´s of models of mopeds, for example JAWA 50 types 20,21 named „pionýr“ or „pařez“ This motorbikes were mostly sell in SSSR. 
Jawa 638-640 has engine 350ccm, it is robust and favourite motorbike in class motorbike.
Today JAWA is sold in many European countries. The newest models are JAWA 660, JAWA 125 and 50 Dandy, JAWA 250, 350 and. Basic of motorbikes is really the same like 70 years ago, but it is very modernized, mainly motors. Today stronger four-stroke motors are used, two-stroke motors are used to 350ccm.

Cathedral of the Holy Spirit (Czech Republic)

The Cathedral of St. Ducha (the holy spirit) was built in 1307 by order of Eliška Rejčka, because the church of St. Klement was too small. The church was burned and rebuilt several times between the 14th and 16th centuries. In the 17th century, the church was plundered by Swedish soldiers. An important milestone for the church was in 1664, Pope Alexander VII blessed the church as a cathedral. The last repairs were done after World War 2.

The cathedral has an old Gothic altar from the end of the 15th century. It also has an early baroque altar from the 17th century. There is a portrait of St. Antoním by Petr Brandla, a pastoforium made by Matej Rejsem and a decorated pulpit by Josef Myslbek. Under the cathedral are 3 crypts. There is a legend about one of them, that Jan Žižka z Trocnova, famous Hussite commander, was temporarily buried there. In the towers are 4 bells named Leopold, Klement, Václav and Michal.

There are services every day. On Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, services are at 18:30. On Sunday, services are at 6:30, 9:30 and 11:00. There is a special service for kids on Wednesdays at 17:30. You can visit the interior of the cathedral during worship.

Computer network

A computer network is a group of more computers connected to each electronically. This means that the computers can "talk" to each other and that every computer in the network can send information to the others. Usually, this means that the speed of the connection is fast - faster than a normal connection to the Internet. Some basic types of computer networks include:


Computers can be part of several different networks. Networks can also be parts of bigger networks. The "local area network" in a small business is usually connected to the "corporate network" of the larger company. Any connected machine at any level of the organization may be able to access the "Internet", for example to demonstrate computers in the store, display its catalogue through a web server, or convert received orders into shipping instructions.

Microsoft Windows, Linux and most other operating systems use TCP/IP for networking. Apple Macintosh computers used Appletalk in the past, but it uses TCP/IP now.

To set up a network an appropriate media is required. This can be wired or wireless. Twisted-pair, co-axial or fiber-optic are examples of cable and infra-red, blue-tooth, radio-wave, micro-wave etc. are wireless media used for networking. When you are working with a mere LAN, computers, media and peripherals are sufficient. But when you are working with a wider range you have use some additional devices like bridge, gateway or router to connect different small or large networks. And obviously a protocol must be maintained.

To set up a network you have to select an appropriate topology to arrange the hardware devices using the media. Topologies generally used are bus-topology, ring-topology, star-topology, tree-topology, object-oriented topology etc. Among these star-topology and tree-topology are most popular nowadays.

The network communication technology as one complet would be very difficult to implement. To simplify it, we must implement various layered network models such as ISO/OSI.
All network models are based on the same principle. The upper layer use services of the lower one and provide services for the upper one. The specific layer can only communicate with the same layer on destination device.

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is 7-layer network model specified by ISO (International Organization for Standardization) norm and its widely used all around the world. The concept of a seven-layer model was provided by the work of Charles Bachman, Honeywell information Services. Various aspects of OSI design evolved from experiences with the ARPANET, NPLNET, EIN, CYCLADES network and the work in IFIP WG6.1.

The physical layer defines electrical and physical specifications for devices. It also specify modulated and baseband transmission.
Is transmission of digital data in their raw form (1001 1101 1010 0011). This allows very fast and reliable communication over short distance, however due to realistic electrical properties of used media, the range of baseband transmission is very limited and decreasing with increasing speed. Baseband technology is frequently used on LAN.
Typical technology: Ethernet
In telecommunications, modulation is the process of conveying a message signal, for example a digital bit stream or an analog audio signal, inside another signal that can be physically transmitted. The device that provides modulation of baseband signal is called modulator, device that provides demodulation of modulated signal back to baseband is called demodulator. Today, the modulator and demodulator are integrated into one device called Modem (modulator-demodulator). Frequently used on WAN, WLAN, WWAN.

Typical technology: WI-FI, ADSL, cable TV connection (CATV)

The data link layer provides the functional and procedural means to transfer data between network entities and to detect and possibly correct errors that may occur in the physical layer.
The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences from a source host on one network to a destination host on a different network using the IP adress.
An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. At present there are two versions of protocols in use – IPv4 and IPv6.

The transport layer provides transparent transfer of data between end users, providing reliable data transfer services to the upper layers. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) of the Internet Protocol Suite are commonly categorized as layer-4 protocols within OSI.
Commonly united into one layer in simplyfied network models, its main purpose is to interact with application, encrypting and establishing dedicated connections if necessary.
Latency, incorrectly called ping, is a value that measures, how much time packets need to travel to destination. It is measured in miliseconds (ms). The tool that measures latency is called ping, commonly using special ICMP packets which are smaller than standard data packets, so they do not weight network by their own.

Is value that measures transfer capacity of network and its measured in bits per second (bps or b/s), today commonly Mbps or Mb/s. It show us how much data units is transferred each second. In present, the average bandwidth is far higher than is necessary and it is not a limiting factor in most cases.
Broadcast is a special transmission that is not addressed to a single device but to all devices in specific network. It is mostly used to automatically issue IP addresses to devices by a DHCP server and to create ARP table that maps the network and speeds up a traffic.

New Bern, North Carolina

New Bern () is a city in Craven County, North Carolina with a population of 29,524. It is located where the Trent and the Neuse rivers meet. The city is 112 miles (180 km) east of Raleigh and 87 miles (140 km) northeast of Wilmington. New Bern is the county seat of Craven County. New Bern is the birthplace of the international drink, Pepsi Cola.

New Bern was an Indian town named Chattoka. Swiss immigrants moved to New Bern in 1710. It was named after the capital of Switzerland: Bern. "Bern" is bear in the German language, and the flags of both towns have the drawing of a bear.

New Bern is the second oldest town in North Carolina. It served as the capital of the North Carolina colonial government and then briefly as the state capital until 1792. After the American Revolution, New Bern became wealthy and quickly developed a rich cultural life. At one time New Bern was called "the Athens of the South." After Raleigh was named as the state capital, New Bern rebuilt its economy with the help of trade routes to the Caribbean and New England. It reached a population of 3,600 in 1815. During the 19th-century Federal period, New Bern was the largest city in North Carolina.

New Bern has four historic districts with homes, stores and churches dating back to the early eighteenth century. Close to the waterfront are more than 164 homes and buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Also nearby are several bed and breakfast inns, hotels, restaurants, banks, antiques stores and specialty shops. Tryon Palace, the home of British governor William Tryon, was built in 1770. It was used as the original state capitol building of newly independent North Carolina. It burned down in the 1790s. People can now visit a replica, built from the original plans and on the original foundation. The Masonic Temple and the Athens Theater are both still very active today. The Masonic Theater is the oldest theater in America in continuous use.

The historic districts also are home to many of the town's 2,000 crape myrtles — New Bern’s official flower — and gardens. The district has flowering dogwoods and azaleas.

Union Point park is where the Neuse and Trent Rivers join. It is the city’s major celebration spot for events such as Neuse River Days and the Fourth of July. In 1979, the local government gave Swiss Bear Downtown Revitalization Corp — a nonprofit corporation of civic leaders — control of the failing downtown area. Today, art galleries, specialty shops, antiques stores, restaurants and inns have changed downtown and the waterfront into a social hub. Improvements are still being made. Built in 1995 through the efforts of Swiss Bear, James Reed Lane is a downtown mini-park and pedestrian walk-through on Pollock Street across from historic Christ Church. Private restoration efforts have returned many of the downtown buildings to their turn-of-the-last-century elegance.

Ecological footprint

An ecological footprint measures of how much humans impact the planet, and how fast they use its natural resources. It is a ratio that directly relates how many resources we use to how fast the planet can regenerate them. It takes into account how much farm land and sea area are necessary for what the world population needs. It counts how many earths it would take to support life if everyone continued to live the way people do. Humans use resources approximately 1.4 times faster then earth can replenish them. Money for the Sustainable Scale Project comes from the Santa-Barbara Family Foundation.

Environmental impact of aviation

People are being more considerate about the environment with regard to vehicles. This is not the case when it comes to aircraft. Air travel has increased considerably. This is affecting the environment due to the noise emitted from the aircraft while it is flying. It also takes fuel to fly the planes which is taken from the environment which also causes pollution. Aircraft pollution has increased a great deal although flying or taking a transportation method that can allow more than a few individuals at a time is more environmentally friendly than a smaller vehicle.

Water footprint

A water footprint is the amount of freshwater used by individuals, or organizations in order to make goods or provide services used by the community. These goods and services may be needed around the entire world. A water footprint can be calculated for any well-established group of users, or producers, and it is measured by dividing the total amount of water consumed, by the polluted area per unit time. While the water footprint of an organization is a positive indicator for water consumption and pollution, it does not indicate how other water sources are affected. Further studies will need to be conducted in order to determine the effect of the water footprint on water sources.

Etymology
The water footprint concept was introduced in 2002 by A.Y. Hoekstra from UNESCO-IHE as an alternative indicator of water use.[2]. The concept was refined and accounting methods were established with a series of publications from two lead authors A.K. Chapagain and A.Y. Hoekstra from the UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education, now at WWF-UK and University of Twente respectively. The most elaborate publications on how to estimate water footprints are a 2004-report on the 'Water footprint of nations' from UNESCO-IHE [3] and the 2008-book Globalization of Water by A.Y. Hoekstra and A.K. Chapagain, published by Blackwell, 2008. Cooperation between global leading institutions in the field has led to the establishment of the Water Footprint Network in 2008 that aims to coordinate efforts to further develop and disseminate knowledge on water footprint concepts, methods and tools.

Each player has a different mission:





After everyone chooses their character and role, the game starts. Every player gets the same amount of cards as the amount of lives they have, so if a player has three lives, they get three cards. At the beginning of turn, the player takes two cards. There are three kinds of cards. They have brown, blue and green edges. Brown cards allow players to play immediately, blue cards mean a player has to put it on the table first.

<doc id="316844" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316844" title="Aspen">
Aspen

Aspens are a type of poplar tree with leaves that move with the slightest wind. The two main species are both called 'trembling aspens' or 'quaking aspens' on account of their leaves.

Populus tremuloides is the American aspen. It is common in temperate and colder regions of North America. 

It forms large stands (groups) of genetically identical trees (clones) connected by a single underground root system. These trees form through root sprouts coming off an original parent tree. The largest known fully connected aspen is a grove in Utah nicknamed 'Pando', and some experts call it the largest organism in the world, by mass or volume. It covers 0.43 km (106 acres) and is estimated to weigh .

Populus tremula is a species of poplar native to cool temperate regions of Europe and Asia, from the British Isles east to Kamchatka, north to inside the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia and northern Russia, and south to central Spain, Turkey, the Tian Shan mountain system, North Korea, and northern Japan. It also occurs at one site in northwest Africa in Algeria. In the south of its range, it occurs at high altitudes in mountains.

It is a hardy species which tolerates long, cold winters and short summers. Aspen is dioecious, so individual trees are either male or female (in contrast to most trees, where male and female flowers occur on the same tree). Trees flower in March and April, before the leaves appear, with both the male and female trees producing catkins. Pollinated female catkins ripen in early summer and release tiny seeds which are tufted with hairs. 

Like other aspens, its main method of reproduction is vegetative (asexual). It spreads extensively by root sprouts, which may be produced up to 40 metres from the parent tree. They form extensive clonal colonies. Large numbers of new shoots can be produced in this way, especially after a major disturbance such as fire.

Arakan is a Burmese state. Situated on the western coast of Myanmar, bordered by Bangladesh.

The term "Rakhine" is believed to have been derived from the Pali word "Rakkhapura" from "Rakkhita" meaning the land of the people of Rakhasa (Rakhasa > Rakkha > Rakkhaing > Rakhaing) who were given this name in honor of their preservation of their national heritage and ethics or morality. The word Rakhine means, "one who maintains his own race." In the Rakhine language, the land is called "Rakhinepray", the ethnic Rakhine are called "Rakhinetha".

Arakan, used in British colonial times, is believed to be a Portuguese corruption of the word Rakhine that is still popularly used in English. Many English language users eschew the name changes promulgated by the military government.

Waltari

Waltari is an alternative metal band from Finland. The band was formed in Helsinki in 1986. The original members were Kärtsy Hatakka, Sale Suomalainen and Jariot Lehtinen. Their name is a reference to popular Finish writer Mika Waltari – a favorite author of band’s guitarist Jariot Lethinen. 

Waltari is more famous in the rest of Europe than in Finland and the band members have very positive relationships to Czech Republic. They’ve collaborated with Czech punk rock band Wohnout and Kärtsy is a good friend of Lenka Dusilová. The band has collaborated with many other artists. They’ve made albums with Finnish ethno band Angelit, they hosted on Apocalyptica’s album and Tarja Turunen from Nightwish was a part of Yeah! Yeah! Die! Die! live performance.

Waltari's music is well known for it’s destruction of rock and metal genre boundaries. Their heavy sound is often combined with elements of electronic music, pop, rap, disco, funk, grindcore and bits of many other genres and creates a fusion which can be described as avant-garde. The lead singer and bass guitarist, Kärtsy Hattaka, delivers very distinctive vocal part to their music and makes Waltari's sound even more unique and easily recognizable. 

Waltari’s lyrics are as diverse as their music. They’re about various range of topics including everyday misery, personal struggles, science fiction motives, and music industry philosophical questions. They have one thing in common – heavy irony, self-irony and sarcasm. 

Waltari started their musical career with demo records. The longest one was "Monk Punk". This album presents an interesting mixture of punk and funk music, but the first release which provided the band more positive reviews was the album called "Torcha!" and it was also the first one which combined bits of many musical genres. It also includes the cover of Madonna’s song "Vogue".

Next two albums, "So Fine" and "Big Bang" were also very successful. They mainly concentrate on mixing heavy metal with techno, which was something fresh and innovative. Their biggest success among death metal fans yet came with the "Yeah! Yeah! Die! Die!" album, which is mixture of death metal and classical music. It also has a musical feeling to it, because it’s kind of an epic story from future sung in dialogues of various characters. 

Next album "Space Avenue" is more electronic and it has some pop feeling to it. Another one called "Radium Round" goes even further in that. It’s almost a pop/disco album with some metal elements. Waltari returned to more rock sound with albums like "Rare Species" and very successful "Blood Sample". Last two albums – "Release Date" and "Below Zero" are mainly focused on heavy sound with bits of progressive rock.

Sir Walter Raleigh (c. 155429 October 1618) was an English aristocrat, writer, poet, soldier, spy, and explorer. He helped make tobacco popular in England, especially among people in the royal court.

Raleigh was born to a Protestant family in Devon, the son of Walter Raleigh and Catherine Champernowne.

In 1594, Raleigh heard of a "City of Gold" in South America and sailed to find it, writing an exaggerated story of his trip in a book. This book made people believe in the legend of "El Dorado". After Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, Raleigh was put in prison because he was accused of trying to overthrow King James I, who did not like Raleigh. In 1616, he was released to go look for El Dorado again. This was unsuccessful, and Raleigh's men attacked a Spanish outpost. He returned to England. The Spanish were upset, so to calm them, England arrested Raleigh and executed him by beheading on 29 October, 1618.

The rings of Uranus are planetary rings (circles of rock and dust) that go around the planet Uranus. There are 13 rings in total. In order of increasing distance from Uranus, they are: 1986U2R/ζ, 6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, λ, ε, ν and μ.

Most of them were found on March 10, 1977 by James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham and Douglas J. Mink. The Voyager 2 spacecraft found two more rings in 1986. Then the Hubble Space Telescope found two more outer rings in 2003-2005.

Most of the rings are only a few kilometres wide and are very dark. Most rings are made of rocks 0.2-20 m wide. But some rings are made of very small dust particles. The closest ring is 38,000 km away from the centre of Uranus and the furthest ring is 98,000 km away.

Scientists think that the rings are at not more than 600 million years old. The ring system was created when several moons crashed together. After crashing, the moons broke up into many pieces and made rings.

Unfortunately, the NC-17 rating went on to acquire stigma: movie stores like Blockbuster wouldn't stock movies under such a rating, certain movie chains would not show such movies and some papers refused advertisements for such films. Certain movie companies will often surrender an NC-17 rating and release a movie with no rating whatsoever; others release movies without a rating if they are expecting such an MPAA rating. Notable motion pictures under an NC-17 classification include Henry & June (1990) and Showgirls (1995).

Excision (musician)

Excision (real name: Jeff Abel) (born 1986 in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada) is a dubstep DJ and music boss. His signature sound takes influence from the morphing basslines of the drum and bass genre, the aggressive energy of heavy metal, and the laid back vibes of hip hop. Excision is also cited as being one of the first dubstep producers and DJs in North America, he has also played a significant role in the genre's growth in popularity. His first release was in 2007. Excision was asked by Pendulum to remix their 2009 single “Showdown.” His musical recordings from the Shambhala Music Festival in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 have also received over a million downloads which are available for free.

Poplar

Poplars are trees common in the northern hemisphere. They are in the genus Populus, which are deciduous flowering plants in the family Salicaceae. The genus has 25–35 species in three sub-groups, commonly called poplars, aspens, and cottonwoods.

In the September 2006 issue of "Science", it was announced that the Western Balsam Poplar ("P. trichocarpa") was the first tree to have its full DNA code sequenced.

The flowers are mostly dioecious (rarely monoecious) and appear in early spring before the leaves. They are borne in long, drooping catkins. The male flowers have a group of 4–60 stamens on a disk. The female flower is a single-celled ovary in a cup-shaped disk. 

Pollination is by wind. The fruit is a two to four-valved capsule, green to reddish-brown, mature in mid summer. It contains tiny light brown seeds surrounded by tufts of long, soft, white hairs which help wind dispersal.

Poplars of the cottonwood section are often wetlands or riparian trees. The aspens are among the most important boreal broadleaf trees.

Poplars and aspens are important food plants for the larvae of a large number of Lepidoptera species. "Pleurotus populinus", the aspen oyster mushroom, is found exclusively on dead wood of "Populus" trees in North America.

Equilibrium constant

For a general chemical equilibrium
the equilibrium constant can be defined by
where {A} is the activity of the chemical species A, etc. (activity is a dimensionless quantity). It is conventional to put the activities of the products in the numerator and those of the reactants in the denominator.

For equilibria in solution, activity is the product of concentration and activity coefficient. Most chemists determine equilibrium constants in a solution with a high ionic strength. In high strength solutions, the quotient of activity coefficients changes very little. So, the equilibrium constant is defined as a concentration quotient:

France currently has five overseas departments (), which are departments (territorial divisions) that are outside the European part of the country. All are officially part of France, with the same political status as the departments in Europe; and are therefore different to overseas territories. They are also part of the European Union and use the Euro as currency. They are:

Since 2003, these departments are now officially called overseas regions (), but this name has yet to be widely adopted. Each region returns elected representatives to the Senate and National Assembly in Paris. A total of three members are elected to the European Parliament to represent overseas France, including overseas departments and overseas territories. Since 1974, these regions have had their own individual regional councils for local government.

Pierre Roger de Beaufort was born in 1331 in Limousin in France. The Rosier or Roger family were important in Limousin in central France.

Beaufort was a nephew of Pope Clement VI.

Clement VI raised Beaufort to the rank of cardinal in 1348.

Cardinal Beaufort was elected pope in 1370; and he chose to be called Gergory XI. He was ordained as a priest on January 4, 1371; and was crowned pope on the following day, January 5, 13271 

In 1377, Gregory XI reestablished the papacy in Rome.

When Gregory died on March 27, 1378, the cardinals in Rome elected an Italian-born pope named Urban VI as his successor. 

In Avignon, the cardinals elected a French-born pope named Clement VII.

The Western Schism begins with the dispute between the supporters of the Italian-born pope and the French-born pope.

Carbon diet

Carbon diet is the process of reducing the production of greenhouse gas, primarily carbon dioxide, to reduce effects on climate change.

Carbon dioxide is produced from heating, driving and consuming products.

The production of carbon dioxide can be reduced by decreasing the intake of carbon, and eventually reduces the effects of climate change.

According to Deborah Jones, her family undergoes carbon diet. They are already in week two of the Globe and Mail assignment. The purpose of this assignment is to see how her family can reduces the emissions of greenhouse gas to reach the provincial goal of 33 percent reduction. It is different from a low carbon diet which is done by choosing what to eat to reduce greenhouse gas discharge.
Carbon is from Latin word carbo "coal" is the chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6. As a member of group 14 on the periodic table, it is nonmetallic and tetravalent—making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. There are three naturally occurring isotopes, with 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is radioactive, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years.

The term "carbon diet" is used in book Gore:A Political Life. There are steps in carbon diet:

Numerical control

Numerical Control (NC) is a way to automate machine tools. In numerical control, the commands these machines get come from a storage medium; they are not controlled and operated manually. The first such machines were built in the 1940s and 1950s. They used punched tape instructions. Soon, the tools were changed, to use computers. Numerical control with computers is known as Computerized numerical control, or CNC.

Nowadays, it is possible to make a program that can run on such machine tools, based on a CAD drawing of the piece to be produced. 

The first attempts to automate machines were done in the 19th century, using so called cams. These are basically wheels that change the position of notches, and can control a machine with this. The basix difference to modern NC is that these cams only automated one given task; modern NC and CNC machines can be programmed to a greater extent.

Mid-Atlantic Ridge

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is where seafloor spreading takes place in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. It is part of a world-wide system of mid-ocean ridges. These ridges make up the longest mountain range in the world, all underwater except for short stretches like Iceland. On Iceland, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge reaches the surface.

The ridge separates oceanic tectonic plates, and moves the plates apart at about 2.5 cm per year.

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge includes a deep rift valley which runs along the middle of the ridge along almost its entire length. At the rift, the boundary between tectonic plates, magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor. New magma emerges onto the ocean floor near the ridge axis. The crystallized magma forms new crust of basalt and gabbro.

The ridge was discovered during the expedition of HMS "Challenger" in 1872. A team of scientists on board discovered a large rise in the middle of the Atlantic. They were planning the future location for a transatlantic telegraph cable. The existence of such a ridge was confirmed by sonar in 1925 

In the 1950s, mapping of the Earth’s ocean floors showed the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to have valleys and ridges. Its central valley is seismologically active and the epicentre of many earthquakes. Ewing and Heezen discovered the ridge to be part of a 40,000-km-long essentially continuous system of mid-ocean ridges on the floors of all the Earth’s oceans. The discovery of this worldwide ridge system led to the theory of seafloor spreading and general acceptance of Wegener's theory of continental drift and expansion as plate tectonics.

The ridge started forming in at the end of the Triassic period, and was responsible for the separation of the Americas from Africa and Europe.

The ridge sits atop a geologic feature known as the Mid-Atlantic Rise which is a progressive bulge that runs the length of the Atlantic Ocean, with the ridge resting on the highest point of this linear bulge. This bulge is thought to be caused by upward convective forces in the asthenosphere pushing up the oceanic crust and lithosphere.

It shows the comparison between the size of the outside of an object and the amount it can hold inside it. Small objects have a large surface area compared to the volume. This gives them a large ratio of surface to volume. Larger objects have small surface area compared to the volume so they have a small surface area to volume ratio.

Metabolism (architecture)

Metabolism is a kind of architecture that began in Japan around 1960. This way of designing buildings came out of the rebuilding of Japan after World War II. Members of the group include: Kiyoshi Awazu, Noboru Kawazoe, Kiyonori Kikutake, Kisho Kurokawa, Fumihiko Maki, Masato Otaka, and Kenzō Tange. They wrote a short book in English and Japanese called ""The proposals for a New Urbanism"" for the World Design Conference in 1960. Many Metabolist projects or designs were very large city plans called "megastructures". The members thought of cities as living things that changed over long periods of time.

These architects were interested in building housing for large numbers of people. They often planned buildings that could be changed. One example is the Nakagin Capsule Tower by Kurokawa (1972). Each apartment was a rectangular block with one round window. These blocks could be added, moved, or removed as needed. It was a ""plug-in building"". Kurokawa planned for new, better capsules to be added to replace old ones. However, people living in the tower plan to tear it down and rebuild a larger building.

The building is actually two towers. One is eleven and the other is thirteen floors. These towers are the utility cores. They have the elevators, stairs, electric, and water services in them. They also support the whole building. 140 capsules are attached to the two cores. Each capsule unit is one apartment or office. They are × × and have one round window. Just four bolts connect each unit to a tower. The units are lightweight steel. They were built in Shiga Prefecture and brought to Tokyo on trucks. The capsules are not connected to each other, so any capsule can be removed or replaced without moving the others.

The towers are the permanent part of the building and the capsules were temporary. Kurokawa planned for new units to be built to replace old ones. As building technology improved, better units could be added. Also, units could be changed as people moved in or out. Capsules could even be moved from one building to another. This part of the plan never happened. No new capsules were ever built.

Residents plan to tear down the building. They say there are problems with asbestos and that the building is too old and hasn't been repaired well. Kurokawa and other architects want to keep the building as an historic example.

Guangzhou

Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province, is also called the City of Flowers. It locates in the south of China and is one of the five biggest cities in China. In mainland China, Guangzhou is regarded as one of the three most popular cities with Beijing and Shanghai, which is called Bei-Shang-Guang for short. It is where the 16th Asian Games held and it is famous for its food all over the world .

Guangzhou is the core city of the South China. It lies on the north of Pearl River Delta, where the Dongjiang River (East River), Xijiang River (West River) and Beijiang River (North River) join together. On its south is the South China Sea. With the geographical advantages, Guangzhou has been a very important port in South China for hundreds of years. Today, it is the biggest and most important port for air, sea, and trains in China. The area of Guangzhou is about . The north part and middle part of Guangzhou are hills. The west part and south part are plains that have a lot of rivers and streams. Guangzhou locates in the subtropics monsoon climate region. It has a lot of sunshine and rains. The average temperature is from 21.4 to 21.9 °C (about 71 °F) and the lowest temperature in winter is about . The rainy season lasts for almost six months and the typhoons in summer also bring lots of rain. The average humidity is about 77 percent.

Guangzhou has Baiyun Airport, which is one of the three most important parts of air transportation in the country. The passenger throughput ranks third in China and 19th in the world. It is also a very important harbor in China, second to Shenzhen in South China and the fourth one in the country. With the Jingguang Railway, Jingjiu Railway, Guangshen Railway and other railways, Guangzhou has become one of the four biggest railway passenger stations in China. A high speed railway has been built here.

Guangzhou has been the city famous for business for hundreds of years. It has been open to the world for nearly 2000 years. After the Reform and Opening Up in 1979, Guangzhou has gained great economic achievement. On one hand, Guangzhou's GDP has grown about 14% per year. It ranks the third economic city in China (not including Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao). On the other hand, Guangzhou has become a city with a sound industrial foundation and developed tertiary-industry. In September of 1993, Guangzhou was accepted as a member of the World Association of Metropolises. 

Most important elements of Guangzhou’s economy are light manufacturing sector and foreign trade. They are the main reasons for Guangzhou’s economic achievement and its attraction to appeal people from all over the world to begin their own business in this city. Every year, the China Import and Export Commodities Fair (Canton Fair) is held here. It has the biggest conference and exhibition center, Guangzhou International Convention and Exhibition Center, in Asia. After 2000, Guangzhou began to change its industrial structure and increase its investment in the heavy manufacturing sector. Nowadays, the automobile industry, petrochemical industry and the IT industry have been the three mainstay industries in Guangzhou.

Guangzhou is a typical city for Lingnan Culture. The main characters of Lingnan Culture are open-mindedness, practical spirit and civilian consciousness. People here don’t adhere to traditional rules. They combine culture from different parts in the world with the local culture and are creating new culture to adjust to the modern world. This is very different from the Centre Plains Culture in the north part of China. Guangzhou has its own opera, Cantonese Opera, and its own language, Cantonese. In Guangzhou Metro, you can hear the announcement for station not only in Chinese and English, but also in Cantonese. Besides, sotto portico is the typical construction for Lingnan Culture. A flowers market held every Spring Festival is famous around South China. 

The education in Guangzhou began in the Western Han Dynasty. Now, Guangzhou is one of the cities with the most colleges and universities in the South China. It is one of the cities which has the most education resouce in the country. The best comprehensive university here is Sun Yat-sen University. It is a university built in memory of Sun Yat-sen, who led the Xinhai Revolution and is regarded as the father of China.

<doc id="317217" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317217" title="Gas discharge lamp">
Gas discharge lamp

Gas discharge lamps are a family of artificial light sources (or lamps). These lamps produce light by sending electricity through a ionized gas. Most of these lamps use a noble gas, or a combination of noble gases, but they often contain other materials, such as mercury, sodium or metal halides. The gases in these lamps are ionized in operation. This means that there are free electrons. When a electric current is sent through the gas, electrons collide with atoms of the gas and the metals. This will mean that some reach a higher energy state. When they fall back into the lower energy state, they will emit the energy in the form of light. 

The fluorescent lamp is probably the best known gas discharge lamp.

Gas-discharge lamps have a long life and a high efficiency, but they are more complicated to manufacture, which makes them more expensive to buy than incandescent lamps. Due to their greater efficiency, gas-discharge lamps are replacing incandescent lights in many lighting applications.

Charged particle

A charged particle, also called an ion, is an atom with a positive or negative charge. This happens whenever something called an ionic bond forms. Two particles that have different numbers of electrons (the smallest particle in an atom which is negative) start reacting to each other. The particle that has the greater amount of electrons steals the other particle's electrons. One becomes positive because it lost an electron, and the other negative because it got another electron. The two particles become attracted to each other and mix together, making a new kind of particle.

House of Pandolfi

The Royal House of Pandolfi was founded in the middle of the ninth century A.D. by Count Landolfo I of Capua in the year 840. It would be by the fruits of his labor and bravery that would give rise to a powerful Italian and Mediterranean dynasty that would, in under less than one hundred years after coming to power, control politically and economically most of Southern Italy. 

Originally, the Pandolfis were of Lombard origin, coming from what is present day Eastern Germany. It is believed that the family had possibly migrated to Italy with the Lombard Army as it made its way down the Italian Peninsula during the time of late antiquity. It was not until later that the family settled as lords of Capua, most likely as vassals to the Lombard Duchy of Benevento. The family first ruled in Capua as Counts and then finally in 887 A.D. as Sovereign Princes. In the beginning of the tenth century A.D. the Pandolfi family, under the grand leadership of Sovereign Prince Atenolfo I, united most of the lands of Southern Italy into one state under one royal crown, forming the Principality of Capua-Benevento. It could be said also, that the Pandolfis are possibly one of the oldest royal families/dynasties in Italy and in Europe. They ruled as Sovereigns from the middle of the ninth century A.D. till the family’s downfall and overthrow in 1098 A.D. at the hands of the Normans. In all, the Pandolfi family and dynasty ruled for a total of 244 years. 

During this extensive period of time, some of the most well known and notable members of the Pandolfi familyincluded: Count Landolfo I of Capua (r. 840-842 A.D.), Count Landolfo II of Capua (r. 862-879 A.D.), Count Pandenolfo of Capua (r. 862-862 A.D. and again from 879-882 A.D.), Sovereign Prince Atenolfo I of Capua-Benevento (r. 887-910 A.D.), Sovereign Prince Pandolfo I of Capua-Benevento (r. 961-981 A.D.), Blessed Pope Victor III of Rome papacy from (1086-1087 A.D.) and Sovereign Prince Landone IV of Capua (r. 1091-1098 A.D.). 

It was during the reigns of Sovereign Princes Atenolfo I and Pandolfo I of Capua-Benevento that the family and dynasty reached the peak of its splendor and power in the Mediterranean World. The realm ruled by the Pandolfi family included what is today parts of Apulia, Basilicata, Calabria, Campania and Molise. In 909 A.D. as a gift of thanks for the family’s diplomatic and military support against Islamic expansion into the Mediterranean Sea Basin, the Eastern Roman Emperor Leo VI awarded the hereditary Byzantine titles of Anthýpatos and Patrikios to the male members of the family and dynasty. The family would officially hold these titles until the collapse of the Byzantine Empire in 1453 at the hands of the Ottoman Turks. 

The Pandolfis were not only Sovereigns, but also outstanding members of society, with some members of the family and dynasty taking up religious and monastic aspirations such as Prince Dauferius who later became Blessed Pope Victor III of Rome. However, at the same time, there were the Pandolfi Counts, and Sovereign Princes of the family who were absolute monarchs and warriors and thus commanders of their vast armies. Members of the Pandolfi dynasty not only bravely served their family, but also fought to strengthen the State of the Principality of Capua-Benevento and the other lands under their domain by fighting for their country’s independence. The Royal House of Pandolfi did not just give Southern Italy extraordinary political stability during its 244 – year rule, but also military leaders, statesmen and politicians who all made significant achievements in the areas of diplomacy.

Throughout history the institution of monarchy has often stood as a testament to the common bond between the people and their Sovereign. The monarch regardless of his title was a symbol of faith, hope, peace and prosperity., and the Pandolfis where no less responsible to their people. 

The Pandolfi dynasty lost its grip on power during the eleventh century A.D. when it was overthrown by the Norman Prince, Richard II of Aversa in 1098. Even with the loss of all its territory at the hands of the Normans, the Pandolfi family still somehow managed to stay afloat all the way into the modern era. 

This Royal House still exisit today, having branches in the modern Republic of Italy and in the United States of America. The American branch of the Royal House of Pandolfi is currently headed by His Serene Highness, Ernest Christopher Konstantine Pandolfi, Titular Hereditary Prince of Capua, Benevento and Salerno; Duke of Camerino and Spoleto; Count of Teano and Aquino; Hýpatos of Gaeta and Naples; and Anthýpatos and Patrikios of Byzantium.

Unilineal evolution, also called Classical social evolution, was the idea that societies evolve in much the same way as species do. Especially in the 19th century, many sociologists and anthorpologists held this idea: In their view, societies can be classified form the most primitive to the most advanced. Important people who held this idea were Johann Bachofen (1825–1887), Lewis Henry Morgan (1818–1881), John Ferguson McLennan (1827–1881), Edward Burnett Tylor (1832–1917), James Frazer (1854–1941) and Herbert Spencer (1820–1903). In the 20th century these theories were replaced with multilineal evolution and neoevolutionism.

Ōnin

The "Ōnin War" started in 1467. This conflict is called "Ōnin no ran" because of the nengō in which it began. The fighting began as a dispute over who should follow Ashikaga Yoshimasa as shogun after his retirement – whether it would be his brother (Yoshimi) or his son (Yoshihisa). 

Rival groups of daimyos fought for military supremacy. In the end, there was no winner. The war stopped because the factions simply exhausted themselves.

The emperor gave Yoshimasa's villa with a special name -- "Higashiyama-dono." Construction begins on the Silver Pavilion, but the work was interrupted by the Ōnin War.

Hurricane Juan (1985)

Hurricane Juan in 1985 was the most costly of all the storms of the hurricane season. It killed around 24 people and caused about $1.5 billion in damage even though it was a weak hurricane. Even though the damage was bad, the name Juan was not removed from the list of hurricane names in the spring of 1986.

<doc id="317385" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317385" title="Ballistic coefficient">
Ballistic coefficient

In ballistics, the ballistic coefficient (BC) of a bullet is a measure of its ability to overcome air resistance in flight. A high BC means the object will slow down less. It will have more of its speed left when it reaches the target. BC depends on mass, diameter, and drag coefficient. Ballistic coefficient has units of lb/in² or kg/m². BCs for bullets are normally stated in lb/in² by their manufacturers without referring to this unit. The values for BC can be as low as 0.12 and as high as 1.00 for commonly used bullets.

A bullet with a high BC will travel farther than one with a low BC since it will keep its speed better, resist the wind better, and “shoot flatter” (see external ballistics).

When hunting with a rifle, a higher BC is good for several reasons. A higher BC results in a flatter flight. The effect of mistakes in estimating the distance to the target is smaller for bullet with a higher BC. This is important when attempting an effective hit on a game animal. If the target animal is closer than estimated, then the bullet will hit higher than expected. On the other hand, if the animal is further than estimated the bullet will hit lower than expected. Such a difference in bullet drop can make the difference between a clean kill and a wounded animal.

This difference in flight path becomes more important at longer distances. Sometimes, the difference in two bullet designs fired from the same rifle can result in a difference between the two of over 30 cm (1 foot) at 500 meters (550 yards). A bullet with a high BC arrives at the target faster and with more energy than one with a low BC.
Since the higher BC bullet gets to the target faster, it is also less affected by crosswinds.

Sporting bullets have BC’s in the range 0.12 to slightly over 1.00, with high being the most aerodynamic, and low being the least. Very-low-drag bullets with BCs ≥ 1.10 can be designed and produced on special lathes using mono-metal rods. These special bullets often have to be fired from custom made full bore rifles with special barrels.

Bullet makers often offer several weights and types for a given size. Heavy-for-caliber pointed (spitzer) bullets with a boat tail design have high BCs. Lighter bullets with square tails and blunt noses have lower BCs. 

In the United States, hunting cartridges such as the .25-06 Remington (a 6.35 mm caliber), the .270 Winchester (a 6.8 mm caliber), and the .284 Winchester (a 7 mm caliber) are used when high BCs are desired.
In the larger sizes, the .338 Lapua Magnum and the .50 BMG are popular with very high BC bullets for shooting beyond 1000 meters. They have very high BCs. Other choices in the larger size are the .375 and .408 Cheyenne Tactical and the .416 Barrett.

Differences in BC claims for exactly the same projectiles can be explained by differences in the air density used for these BC statements or differing range-speed measurements on which the stated G1 BC averages are based. The BC changes during a projectile's flight and stated BCs are always averages for certain distances and speeds. Some more explanation about the transient nature of a projectile's G1 BC during flight can be found at the external ballistics article. This article suggests that knowing how a BC was established is almost as important as knowing the stated BC value itself.

To find the correct BC (osome scientists would call it drag coefficients), Doppler radar-measurements are required. The normal shooting or aerodynamics person, however, does not have this expensive equipment. Weibel 1000e Doppler radars are used by governments, professional ballisticians, defense forces, and a few ammunition manufacturers to get exact real world data on the flight behavior of projectiles of interest.

Test results came from many shots, not just a single shot. Any single bullet can have a very different BC than another. It is important to know the average behavior of a bullet. How different speed regimes affect several rifle bullets made by Lapua can be seen in the .338 Lapua Magnum product brochure which states Doppler radar established BC data.

Most ballistic mathematical models and hence tables or software assume that one specific drag function correctly describes the drag and hence the flight characteristics of a bullet related to its ballistics coefficient. Those models do not have any differences for wadcutter, flat-based, spitzer, boat-tail, very-low-drag, etc. bullet types or shapes. However, some different drag curve models have been made for several standard projectile shapes.<br>


These free computer programs can be used to calculate ballistic coefficient if other information is known.

So Weird was a Disney Channel television show about a girl of 14 called Fiona Phillips, played by Cara Delizia. She was obsessed with the occult. She was the daughter of a singer named Molly Phillips, played by Mackenzie Phillips, and had a brother, age 16, named Jack. Fiona was played by Cara Delizia. In the series her singer mother homeschools her and they travel around the country by bus. In the series Fi's brother is skeptical of the occult. Their father was obsessed with it but died when Fi was only 3. Later on in the series Fi meets an entity called a will o' the wisp who seems to know her father and gives her information about him. He takes possession of her brother Jack's body in one episode until she expels him by discovering his name and saying it through a computer puzzle based on a hint he gives her. His name is Bricriu. Bricriu in a later episode takes possession of her mother's body and tries to prevent her from meeting a man who knows who killed her father. Bricriu lets slip to her that his allies in the spirit, although not Bricriu himself, murdered her father because of his investigations into their world. He finally meets Fi again in the first episode of season 3 and convinces her to give up interest in the occult in order to protect her family. Fi stopped appearing in the show after that episode. Fi met her father by time traveling to her third year in the episode Fountain. The first two seasons of the show, particularly the second, were dark. In the second season Fi even meets vampires. However, in the third season Disney decided to choose a lighter tone. Also Delizia left the show in the third season so she was replaced by Alex Johnson who played a new character called Annie who replaced Fi.

Carmen Amaya

Carmen Amaya (2 November 1913 – 19 November 1963) was a flamenco dancer and singer, of gypsy origin, born in the Somorrostro slum of Barcelona, Spain. 

She has been called "the greatest Spanish gypsy dancer of her generation". and "the most extrardinary personality of all time in flamenco dance".

She danced from the time she was 4 years old. Accompanied on the guitar by her father, she danced in waterfront bars in Barcelona. A young person who saw her dance as a girl was the Spanish guitarist Sabicas (Agustín Castellón Campos). He later said "I saw her dance and it seemed like something supernatural to me... I never saw anyone dance like her. I don’t know how she did it, I just don’t know!". Sabica accompanied her for many years. He recorded "Queen of the Gypsies" (1959) and "Flamenco!" with Amaya.

In 1929, she made her debut in Paris, to warm acclaims and admiration of her dancing skill. She moved to America in 1936, where she went on to act in several films that broke box office records, including the "Romeo and Juliet" adaptation "Los Tarantos", and the short film "Danzas Gitanas" (Gypsy dances). 

One thing was strange about her: she often danced in trousers rather than the layered skirt traditional for female flamenco dancers. One theory is that she did this to give more scope to her footwork, which was exceptional, and rather like a flamenco male dancer. Apparently, in early flamenco, women did not do so much footwork, and male dancers usde to fill in the steps while sitting on chairs, unseen in the wings. Her style has been described as repetitive because she always did the same dances: "Carmen was a fabulous dancer, but limited" (Antonio Ruiz Soler).

She was invited by Franklin Roosevelt to dance in the White House in 1944, and also by Harry S. Truman in 1953.

Amaya is buried in the Cementiri del Sud-Oest on Barcelona's Montjuïc.

With his cousin Rosario (Florence Pérez Padilla) he had a partnership which was world-famous for 25 years (1928–1953. They were billed as Antonio and Rosario.

In 1952 he formed his own Spanish ballet company, "Antonio and the Ballets de Madrid", and Rosario also formed a company, partnered by Iglesias. Antonio choreographed many works in Spanish and classical style; several were taken up by other companies.

A foam is a substance that is formed by trapping gas in bubbles. Gas is present in large amounts so it will be divided in gas bubbles separated by liquid regions which may form films, thinner and thinner when the liquid phase is drained out of the system. When the scale is small, e.g. for fine foam, this dispersed medium can be considered as a type of colloid.

Marcel Koller

Marcel Koller (born 11 November 1960 in Zürich) is a former Swiss football (soccer) player. His playing position was defender. He is now head coach of the Austria national team.
He played all his time as professional football player for Grashoppers Zürich in the Swiss league. In 24 years he won seven Swiss championships and five Swiss cups. He played also 56 times for the Swiss national football team. He shot 3 goals and was member of the team for the 1996 UEFA European Championship.
Koller's career as coach started at the Swiss club FC Wil in the season 1997/98. In January 1999 he went to FC St. Gallen in the Swiss Super League. The next year the club won the championship since almost 100 years. In the UEFA Cup the Swiss team could eliminate English top club FC Chelsea. Koller was voted Swiss manager of the year 2000. From 2002 till 2003 he managed his former club Grashoppers Zürich. His first club abroad was in the German Bundesliga where he managed 1. FC Köln. Being not successful he resigned after seven months. In this time Lukas Podolski made his first match in the Bundesliga.

From 2005 on he was coach of the VfL Bochum in the 2.Bundesliga. They promoted to the Bundesliga. The next year was planed to stay in the league. The club finished this year at the 8th place, the third best season for Bochum ever. After poor results at the beginning of the 2009/10 season Koller was dissmissed.

On the 4th of October 2011, Koller was declared as the new coach of the Austrian National Team (ÖFB). It was announced that he signed a contract until December 2013. After his nomination there was heavy criticism against him because he was from abroad. During the long history of the team he is the third coach who was not from Austria. He took over at 1st November. His first match as new coach was a friendly match versus Ukraine which the Austrian team lost.

Zork

Zork was one of the first interactive fiction computer games and a descendant of Colossal Cave Adventure. The first version of "Zork" was written in 1977–1979. 

"Zork" was originally MIT hacker slang for an unfinished program. The creators named the completed game "Dungeon", but changed it back to "Zork" after receiving a trademark violation notice from the publisher of "Dungeons & Dragons". Zork has also been adapted to a book series.

Three of the original "Zork" programmers joined with others to found Infocom in 1979. That company adapted "Zork" into "Zork I-III", a trilogy of games for most popular small computers of the era. Personal Software published what would become the first part of the trilogy under the name "Zork" when it was first released in 1980, but Infocom later handled the distribution of that game and their later games. Part of the reason for splitting Zork into three different games was that, at the time, micros did not have enough memory and disk storage to handle the entirety of the original game. In the process, more content was added to Zork to make each game stand on its own. A version of "Zork I" was issued as a hidden 'easter egg' in . It has exactly the same text and rules as the original.

"Zork" is set in "the ruins of an ancient empire lying far underground". The player is a nameless adventurer "who is venturing into this dangerous land in search of wealth and adventure". The goal is to return from the "Great Underground Empire" alive with the treasures, ultimately inheriting the title of Dungeon Master. The dungeons are stocked with many novel creatures, objects and locations, among them grues, zorkmids, and Flood Control Dam #3—all of which are referenced by subsequent Infocom text adventures. 

FrobozzCo International is a fictional monopoly from the game. FrobozzCo products are littered throughout all "Zork" games, often with humorous effect.


All these are text-only unless otherwise noted.





After a six year hiatus, the following games were produced:

Neusis construction

The neusis is a geometric construction method that was used by ancient Greek mathematicians. At that time, people did not have good rules to measure distances. They did not know algebra. So, they studied geometry by moving fixed length sticks around on a piece of paper.

The neusis construction (from Greek νεῦσις from νεύειν "neuein" "incline towards"; plural: νεύσεις "neuseis") fits a line element of given length ("a") in between two given lines ("l" and "m"), in such a way that the line element, or its extension, passes through a given point "P". That is, one end of the line element has to lie on "l", the other end on "m", while the line element is "inclined" towards "P".

A neusis construction might be performed by means of a 'Neusis Ruler': a marked ruler that is rotatable around the point "P" (this may be done by putting a pin into the point "P" and then pressing the ruler against the pin). In the figure, one end of the ruler is marked with a yellow eye with crosshairs: this is the origin of the scale division on the ruler. A second marking on the ruler (the blue eye) indicates the distance "a" from the origin. The yellow eye is moved along line "l", until the blue eye coincides with line "m". The position of the line element thus found is shown in the figure as a dark blue bar.

Point "P" is called the pole of the neusis, line "l" the directrix, or guiding line, and line "m" the catch line. Length "a" is called the "diastema" (διάστημα; Greek for "distance").
"Neuseis" have been important because they sometimes provide a means to solve geometric problems that are not solvable by means of compass and straightedge alone. Examples are the trisection of any angle in three equal parts, or the construction of a regular heptagon. Mathematicians such as Archimedes of Syracuse (287–212 BC) freely used "neuseis". Slowly, the Greeks stopped using it.

T. L. Heath, the historian of mathematics, thought that the Greek mathematician Oenopides (ca. 440 BC) was the first to put compass and straightedge constructions above "neuseis". Hippocrates of Chios (ca. 430 BC) may have spread the idea that mathematicians should avoid "neuseis" whenever possible. He came from the same island as Oenopides, and who was—as far as we know—the first to write a systematically ordered geometry textbook. One hundred years after him, Euclid also said bad things about "neuseis" in his very influential textbook, "The Elements".

The next attack on the neusis came when, from the fourth century BC, Plato's idealism gained ground. Under its influence, a hierarchy of three classes of geometrical constructions was developed. Descending from the "abstract and noble" to the "mechanical and earthly", the three groups were:

In the end, the Greek mathematicians thought that using a neusis was acceptable only when the two other, higher groups of constructions did not offer a solution. Neusis became a kind of last resort that was invoked only when all other, more respectable, methods had failed. Using neusis where other construction methods might have been used, was branded by the late Greek mathematician Pappus of Alexandria (ca. 325 AD) as "a not inconsiderable error".

Acute accent

The acute accent ( ´ ) is a mark in many written languages. It is usually added to the top a vowel to show how to say it. Acute accents are sometimes added to consonants too. Sometimes, the acute accent changes the sound of the whole word by giving it stress in a sentence. This accent is part of many modern languages that use Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek alphabets. The acute accent is one of many similar marks called diacritics.

The acute accent was first used in Ancient Greece. It told the speaker when to say a syllable with a high pitch. Another early accent mark was the apex. In Latin the apex marked long vowels.

The acute accent is mainly used to tell readers about the sound of vowels in words. Sometimes it is very important to the meaning because it shows the difference between two similar words. For example "resume" may mean to start again, but "résumé" is a summary of someone's work and school experience. Some languages use the accent to show the same changes in sounds, but others use it differently. The acute accent may show:

Some languages use the accent to actually make new letters. Both Faroese and Icelandic add the acute accent to all of their vowels to make new letters. These letters, á, í, ó, ú and ý (plus é in Icelandic) are separate letters with different pronunciations. In Turkmen, the letter Ý is a consonant: .

Many languages have borrowed words from French. Many Norwegian words which came from French keep an acute accent. Some examples are: "allé", "kafé", "idé", "komité". Swedish examples include "café" and "resumé" (noun). Examples in English include: "attaché", "canapé", "cliché", "communiqué", "café", "décor", "fiancé", "passé", "toupée" and "touché". However, sometimes writers forget or choose not to use the accent mark.

Some languages such as Arabic, Persian, or Japanese do not use alphabets. Some writers use the acute accent to tell how the words should sound when words from these languages are written in English. This is more common in older books and less common today.

The ISO-8859-1 and Windows-1252 character encodings included "á", "é", "í", "ó", "ú", "ý". They also had how letters and accents looked when they were written as capital letters. Unicode has many more letters with the acute accent.

To make an accented letter in a Microsoft Office software (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.), users hold the "ctrl" key and press the apostrophe (') key once. Then, let the "ctrl" key go, and press the letter they want.

On Apple Macintosh computers, users press "option-e" and then the vowel. Vowels can also be capitalised. For example, users make á by pressing "option-e" and then 'a'. Pressing "Option-e" and then "Shift-a" makes Á.

On Wikipedia, users make these symbols by clicking on a link in a box. Some other websites work the same way.

<doc id="317675" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317675" title="Sonitpur">
Sonitpur

Sonitpur is a major district of Assam, India.

The name `Sonitpur’ as well as Tezpur literally means "the city of blood". 
It reminds of the romantic legend of Usha and Anirudha. The legend revolves around Banasura, the great Asura king of ancient Tezpur, his beautiful daughter Usha and her friend Chitralekha. The princess saw a handsome prince in her dreams and fell in love with him. Chitralekha, a talented artist, not only painted his portrait from Usha's description but recognised him to be Aniruddha, the grandson of Lord Krishna and ruler of Dwarka. Using her magical powers, Chitralekha spirited Aniruddha away to the princess' boudoir where the two married each other according to Gandharva rites, without the knowledge of the king. When Banasura learnt of the clandestine romance, he imprisoned Aniruddha, which led to the arrival of Lord Krishna to rescue his grandson. A fierce battle followed and the entire city was drenched in human blood, hence the name Sonitpur or Tezpur, i.e. ‘the city of blood’ . 
The story of eternal love between Usha and Aniruddha finds expression in many stories, novels, dramas, dance-dramas, movies.

Sir Edward A. Gait ( 1897) had made reference to the nine line inscription of Harjjar Varma in his ‘’A History of Assam.’’ The inscription is the first recorded history of Assam and dates back to 829 A.D. The inscription was found engraved on a massive
stone some two kms away from Tezpur town situated near a temple called Rudrapad.
Salastambha dynasty ruled Kamrupa from seventh to Tenth century A.D. The accurate boundary of their kingdom is debatable. But the erstwhile Darrang was certainly a part of the kingdom. They shifted their capital from Pragjyotishpur to Haruppeswara, or Hatappeswara- the present day Tezpur. The famous King of the dynasty Harjjar Varma, besides other things had excavated a large pond in 70 acres of land, later came to be known as Hajara Pukhuri ( Harjjara Pukhuri ).Pal dynasty ruled Haruppeswara till the 12th century. The most famous ruler of the Pal dynasty was Brahmapal.
After the Pal dynasty’’ the royal dominance of the Koch Kings in the west and the Ahoms in the east started growing. During the 14th and 15th century a large part of the western bank of Brahmaputra from Singri in the west and Sootea in the east was ruled by the Bara-Bhuyans. The great saint poet Sri Sri Shankardeva belonged to Bara-Bhuyan family, who settled at Rowta in Darrang District. The Ahom King Suhungmung alias Dihingia Raja occupied the territories of the Bara-Bhuyans on the north in 1505 A.D.The Koch King Biswa Sinha rose to power in 1515 A.D. King Naranarayana who ascended the thorne in about 1540 A. D. divided his Kingdom into two parts. He had given the eastern part to the son of his brother Chilarai and the western part of the kingdom to his own son Lakshminarayana. But soon after their ascension as kings, fatricidal war broke out and Lakshminarayana sought refuge with the Mughals which eventually led to invasion of Kamrup by the Mughals. Balinarayana, one of the brothers of Pariksitnarayana fled away to Gorgaon to seek the help of the Ahom king Swargadew Pratapsingha. Pratapsingha christened Balinarayana as Dharmanarayana, made him the king of Darrang and declared war against the the Mughals (1616-1637 A.D.). The Ahoms defeated the mighty Mughals in the Bharali war and re-occupied Darrang from the Mughals. King Dharmanarayana made supreme sacrifice in Singari war in 1638. His son Sundarnarayana ascended the throne and became the king of Darrang.(excluding Tezpur). On the otherhand, the Ahoms ruled the eastern part of Darrang ( present Sonitpur) through Kalia Bhomora Borphukan, stationed at Kaliabor. The Ahom Kings resettled many people in the southern part of Brahmaputra.

The British annexed the then Assam into the Indian British Empire in 1826. After1826 the Lower Assam and the Central Assam (Darrang, Nagaon and Raha) were made one division which extended up to Biswanath. The division was placed under one Administrative Officer designated as the Principal Assistant to the Commissioner. The Upper Assam portion was left to the native rulers with supervisory control under a British political agent with political headquarters at Biswanath. Captain Neufville was the political agent for Upper Assam. Darrang Division was administered till 1833 from Guwahati.
Darrang was converted into a district and Mangaldai was made the district Headquarter in 1833. But due to various reasons the British shifted the head quarter to Tezpur in 1835. The district comprised of two sub-divisions, Tezpur sadar sub-division and Mangaldoi sub-division with head quarter at Mangaldoi. The District of Darrang was divided in to six Revenue Circles under one Sub-Deputy Collector in each Circle. There was one Transferred area in the district at Charduar. An Asst. Political Officer was posted at Charduar under the Deputy Commissioner who acted as Political Officer.
Tezpur was a small township then. The British developed Tezpur as a small garrison township. Later, tea gardens were set-up throughout the district. The old steamarghat at Jahajghat, the Dak-Bungalow, the then Chummery compound at present Don-Bosco School campus, the Planters Club of Tezpur (Stations Club) , the Jahajghat Railway Station, the Church of Ephiphany etc and many tea gardens are some of the examples of the contributions of the British.

There is no specific information about the alignment of the people of the district in the earlier struggle for liberation waged by the princely and upper class people in Upper Assam from 1828 to 1857. But, with the spread of western education during the last part of the 19th century a new awakening surcharged the patriots of the land.
Few years before the birth of the Indian National Congress in Bombay in 1885, the Tezpur Ryot Sabha was formed by a group of enlightened people primarily to protest against the enhancement of land revenue and to ventilate other public grievances .
The Tezpur Ryot Sabha sent Kali Krishna Barkakoti to as its delegate to the National Congress in 1885. It had played an active role in early period of the freedom struggle.
The All Assam Student Association formed in 1916 worked in the district under the leadership of Chandra Nath Sarma.
In June, 1921, the Tezpur District Congress Committee was formed under the presidency of Chandra Nath Sarma.
In August 1921, Mahatma Gandhi visited Tezpur and recorded his impression of the visit in Young India in the article ``From the Bank of Brahmaputra ".
In 1934 Mahatma Gandhi visited Tezpur again during the course of Civil Disobedience Movement.
In the final phase of British Period the Quit India Movement gained momentum with the slogan " Do or Die" in places like Tezpur, Sootea, Gohpur, Dhekiajuli and Jamuguri.

On 10th September 1942, at Gohpur a young girl led a procession of unarmed villagers under Congress flag. She was Kanaklata Barua – a girl from Barangabari village. As soon as Kanaklata unfurled the flag she and her companion Mukunda Kakati were gunned down by the armed Police. The saga of her heroic sacrifice is still remembered with pride.
On the same day at Dhekiajuli Police Station eleven unarmed villagers were gunned down by the armed Police while trying to hoist the tri-color at the Police Station - three of them were teen-aged girls- Tileswari, Numali and Khahuli .
Finally, the British era had come to an end on 15th August "1947" when India gained her Independence in the midnight of 14th August.

The administration set up by the British continued even after Independence. Darrang district with head quarter at Tezpur continued as an impotant district of Assam. 
Towards 1961, Tezpur started to become a center of Trade and Commerce. A year later, in 1962, war broke out with China. The Chinese Army advanced up-to Sessa near Bhalukpung. People started fleeing from their homes. The war had left a bitter experience in the minds of the people of the district.
In 1983, Darrang district was bifurcated. Tezpur sadar sub-division was named as Sonitpur district with an outlying Sub-Division at Biswanath Chariali. Mangaldoi sub-division was named as Darrang district.
On 15th August, 2000, another Sub-Division namely Gohpur Sub-Division was carved out from the erstwhile Biswanath Sub-Division.
Two major events in the field of communication and education can be cited as landmarks in post-independence history of the district. The first one being the construction of Kalia Bhomora Bridge and its inauguration on 14th April,1987, by Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India. The second one is the establishment of a Central University at Napaam named as Tezpur University.
In the cultural front one can very well name the trio of Assamese culture who were born in the district. The post independence era had seen their talents flourishing which had not only enriched the cultural horizon of the district but has also contributed to formation of a composite Assamese culture.

Some of these countries were the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, and Germany. It was named after its authors, Frank B. Kellogg and Aristride Briand.

The pact said that war was wrong and should be banned, but said nothing about what to do with a country that went to war anyway. The pact was the result of a determined American effort to avoid involvement in the European alliance system. The Kellogg-Briand Pact was registered with the League of Nations on September 4, 1928.

Velvet revolution started at official event of 50th anniversary of closing czechoslovakian universities on November 17th 1939 by nazists in Prague. This event continued after its official end and was violently definitly ended by state police on the street "Národní třída". In next days people theyself organized meetings for protest against the action of state police. At one of the biggest protest action on November 25 was about 750 to 800 thousand peoples.

On November 27 was general strike. Its main phrase was "Konec vlády jedné strany" - "End of one-part government". This day was on Wenceslas Square protest-action with 300 000 peoples.

Václav Havel was named as president of Czechoslovakia on December 29th 1989. He was the first non-communist president of Czechoslovakia since 1948.

Didcot power station

Didcot Power Station refers to a combined coal and oil power plant (Didcot A Power Station) and a natural-gas power plant (Didcot B Power Station) that supply the National Grid. They are right next to one another in the civil parish of Sutton Courtenay, next to the town of Didcot in Oxfordshire (formerly in Berkshire), in the UK. The combined power stations feature a chimney which is one of the taller structures in the United Kingdom, and six hyperbolic cooling towers, which can be seen from much of the surrounding area.

This was the first power station here. It is the biggest one with the big cooling towers (that make the cooling water cooler and make lots of steam) that are in two groups. One group is northwest, the other group is southeast. The power station can make up to 2000 megawatts (2000 million watts - an 'average' lightbulb uses only 50 or 60 watts) at any one time. Didcot 'A' mainly burns coal, but can also burn oil, or in some cases gas. This power station can use some biomass such as wood. The fuel (coal, oil and so on) is first ground up in big mills if it is solid (similar to old flour windmills, but powered by electric motors) to give it a large surface area, and is then blown into a large boiler with lots of air. Here it is burnt to make very high pressure steam, which is used to turn a large steam turbine. This turbine is connected to a generator, which makes the electricity that is then sent out on the Naitional Grid.

This is the second power station in Didcot and is run only on gas. It can put out almost 1500 megawatts and uses gas turbines (like in an airplane) and steam turbines (like in the old power station) together to be more efficient. This is called combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT). It has smaller cooling towers that can't be seen as easily, but that make a more obvious cloud that appers to come from the ground.

Samgyetang

Samgyetang is Korean ginseng chicken soup. It’s a very healthy food during the summer, especially on the three days called ‘bok day’s.

Samgyetang is made of a whole young chicken stuffed with sticky rice, ginseng, jujube, garlic, and ginger. The chicken is “closed” shut and cooked in a soup. The richness of the broth depends on the style of the cook, as is the added ingredients that may be added. Some Samgyetang broths are cooked for hours. This broth is added to the chicken cooking separately to create a very rich soup. Other broths are lighter and clear. It’s a matter of preference.

Samgyetang is usually served with salt and pepper, which is put in a small separate dish to dip the meat. Some people like to add the seasoning directly into the soup. It is usually served with kkakdugi (radish kimchi) and some restaurants will offer regular kimchi as well.

Sesame oil

Sesame oil is a vegetable oil made from the sesame plant. It is used a lot in Asian cooking.

The English term sesame traces back to the Arabic "simsim", Coptic "semsem", and and early Egyptian "semsent". "Semsent" was listed in the Ebers Papyrus, a 65-feet-long scroll listing ancient herbs and spices discovered by the famous German Egyptologist, Ebers. The earliest recorded use of a spice - sesame seed - comes from an Assyrian myth which claims that the gods drank sesame wine the night before they created the earth. Sesamum indicum, (indicum meaning "from India") is native to the East Indies. Usage dates back to 3000 B.C. Over 5,000 years ago, the Chinese burned sesame oil not only as a light source but also to make soot for their ink-blocks. African slaves brought sesame seeds, which they called benné seeds, to America, where they became a popular ingredient in southern dishes. Through the ages, the seeds have been a source of food and oil. Sesame seed oil is still the main source of fat used in cooking in the Near East and Far East.

Good sesame oil has a strong smell when it is opened. The color should be bright brown or gold. It should be kept at . If it is too cold, the oil would be solid and lose its smell. Sesame oil can go bad if it is exposed to air and sunlight. Therefore it is better kept on a shelf or a sideboard. A dark brown bottle is better than a plain one, because the brown one can protect the oil from the sunlight better. The bottle should be closed tightly to keep air out.

Many things affect the price. Oil content is the most important. Usually a bottle of sesame oil has 40~55%. The more oil content it has, the higher price it has. Another element is country of origin. Also if you buy it made from a factory it would cost less than oil made in a country house by a farmer.

The Kiss (Klimt painting)

The painting "The Kiss" (original "Der Kuss") is the work painted by Gustav Klimt. He began to paint it in 1907 and it is one of the famous works in his 'Golden Period'. The Österreichische Galerie Belvedere museum, in the Belvedere palace, in Vienna, Austria is exhibiting the painting.

The painting shows a couple embracing each other with gold leaf on canvas. The man is kissing the woman, who has red hair. Klimt has said he had obsession for the woman with redheads, and it was reflected in the woman in his painting.

The man and woman are on a flowery grassland. According to the psychoanalytical and biological distinction, Klimt expressed them in different ways. The man wearing a robe with black, white and gray rectangles is described in a rough way, while the woman is expressed with the smooth figures such as a circle, a curve, and flowery patterns. Her hair is also combined with flowers; it looks like she is surrounded with flowers. On the contrary, the part outside the couple in the painting is filled with flat patterning which has small gleaming dots. 

"The Kiss" represents fin-de-siecle spirit because it shows a decadence through opulent and sybaritic images. Also, the painting has some styles recalling the arts of other period. Of them, by using gold leaf, the painting reflects medieval "gold-ground" paintings and earlier mosaics, and the spiral patterns in the clothes recall Bronze Age art.

In the Kiss, Klimt portrays woman as the femme fatale who is a beautiful woman attracting men sexually but brings them unhappiness. It is said that the woman modeled for the painting, however, his life companion Emilie Flöge,who participated as the Viennese bohemian (Bohemianism) and fin-de-siecle circles like Klimt.

Appendage

Appendages are parts of animals attached the main body. Many arthropods have appendages on each, or most, of their segments. Millipedes, for example, have many segments, and almost all carry two legs. Insects have exactly six legs, two on each segment of the thorax. Antennae (feelers) attached to their heads are another type of appendage.

Wings, parts of the tail, legs, some mouthparts, external sex organs can all be described as appendages.

Appendages may be uniramous, as in insects and centipedes, where each appendage comprises a single series of segments, or it may be biramous, as in many crustaceans, where each appendage branches into two sections. 

All arthropod appendages are variations of the same basic structure (homologous). Which structure is produced is controlled by homeobox genes. Changes to these genes have allowed scientists to produce animals (such as "Drosophila melanogaster") with modified appendages, such as legs instead of antennae.

List of political parties in Azerbaijan

This is a list of political parties in Azerbaijan.

Azerbaijan is a one-party dominant state, meaning that is a system of majority rule where one political party, in this case the ruling New Azerbaijan Party, has successively won election victories by a very large majority and is therefore the dominant ruling party, which does not have to form coalitions (alliances) with other smaller political parties as a result. The one party dominant state differs from a one-party state, because opposition parties against the New Azerbaijan Party are allowed, but are widely considered to have no real chance of gaining power.

The one-party dominant state differs from a one-party state, because opposition parties against the dominant ruling party are allowed, but have no real chance of gaining power. 

Many one-party dominant states are dictatorships where only one party can by law be in control, but some one-party dominant states are real democracies, where there are no limits by law against other parties.

A case of this was Mexico, where Presidential candidates (person running for this governmental office) of the Institutional Revolutionary Party were popularly elected for more than 70 years.

Kenneth G. Wilson

Kenneth Geddes Wilson (born June 8, 1936) is an American theoretical physicist and Nobel Prize winner.

As an undergraduate at Harvard, he was a Putnam Fellow. He earned his PhD from Caltech in 1961, studying under Murray Gell-Mann. 

He became a junior faculty member in Cornell University Physics Department in 1963. He became a full professor in 1970. In 1974, he became the James A. Weeks Professor of Physics at Cornell. He was a co-winner of the Wolf Prize in physics in 1980, together with Michael E. Fisher and Leo Kadanoff. He got the 1982 Nobel Prize in Physics for combining quantum field theory and the statistical theory of critical phenomena of second-order phase transitions. In other words the prize was for his constructive theory of the renormalization group. In this theory he gave not only important, and even numerical, insights to the field of critical statics and dynamics in statistical physics, but indirectly also basic answers to the question: "What is quantum field theory?" and "What does renormalization mean?". He also gave a constructive answer to another important "renormalization" problem from solid-state physics, the Kondo effect.

He advocated that the federal government should buy supercomputers for science research. In 1985, he was appointed as Cornell's Director of the Center for Theory and Simulation in Science and Engineering (known now as the Cornell Theory Center, one of five national supercomputer center created by the National Science Foundation. Since 1988, Dr. Wilson has been a faculty member at The Ohio State University. His current research interests include physics education research.

Some of his PhD students include Roman Jackiw, Steve Shenker, and Michael Peskin.

Wilson's father was the prominent chemist E. Bright Wilson, and his brother David is also a Professor at Cornell in the department of Molecular Biology and Genetics.

<doc id="317823" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317823" title="Apex (diacritic)">
Apex (diacritic)

In written Latin, the apex (plural: "apices") is a diacritic. It is close to the shape of an acute accent ( ´ ). The apex is used to show that a vowel is long and not short. That means that the vowel is pronounced for longer.

The shape and length of the apex can be different. It can even sometimes be different within the same writing. While pretty much all apices are made up of a of a line sloping up to the right, the line can be more or less curved, and is different in length from less than half the height of a letter to more than the height of a letter. Sometimes, it is put at the top with a hook, pointing out to the left. Rather than being centered over the vowel it changes, the apex is often drawn to the right.

Later, it developed into the acute accent, which is still used in some languages to mark vowel length. In particular, Czech and Slovak, Hungarian, Irish, and (a long time ago) Icelandic.

Although not really known by some modern Latinists, the sign was actually used a lot during classical and postclassical times. The reason why it is not usually noticed is probably because of its smallish size and the fact that it is usually quite thin. People who look carefully will soon start to notice apices in the exhibits of any museum, not only in many of the more formal epigraphic writings, but also in handwritten palaeographic things.

Forgetting the apex, modern Latin spelling has recently started marking long vowels by using the macron. The macron is a sign that had always been used, and still is, to mark metrically long "syllables" (more recently called "heavy" syllables). This has caused confusion between syllable and vowel length in Latin, and most western dictionaries still can't describe the nature of Latin vowels properly because of this. To make even more confusion, the acute accent is sometimes used in Latin to mark stressed syllables, just like in Spanish, when the macron is not used.

The apex is often thought to be the opposite of another ancient Latin diacritic, the sicilicus, which is said to have been used above "consonants" to show that they should be pronounced as doubles. However, in his article "Apex and Sicilicus", Revilo P. Oliver says that they are the same sign, a "geminationis nota". This was used over any letter to show that the letter should be read twice. 

If Revilo P. Oliver is right, the apex as a sign showing vowel length would have been made in the time when long vowels were written double. Then, when long vowels were not regularly written twice. 

However, Oliver's view that the two marks were the same has recently been challenged.

Differential geometry

Differential geometry is a field of mathematics. It uses differential and integral calculus as well as linear algebra to study problems of geomery. The theory of the plane, as well as curves and surfaces in Euclidean space are the basis of this study. Big discoveries were made in the 18th and 19th century. In geometry, the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. Carl Friedrich Gauß wondered whether triangle bearings of ships really has a sum of angles of exactly 180 degrees; with this question he was among the pioneers of modern differential geometry.

A long time ago, differential geometry was used for map projections. Today, it is used for fields as diverse as general relativity theory, or satellite naviagation. Grigori Perelman's proof of the Poincaré conjecture uses differential geometry.

The New Azerbaijan Party ("Yeni Azərbaycan Partiyası", YAP) is the ruling political party in Azerbaijan since 1993. 

It was formed on 18 December 1992 by the former President of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev, who led it until his retirement and death in 2003. It is now led by his son, Ilham Aliyev, who succeeded his father as the party leader and as President of Azerbaijan since October 31, 2003. The founder of the party, Heydar Aliyev, was a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union until July 1991 before the collapse of the Soviet Union and the independence of Azerbaijan later that year. The headquarters of the party is in the capital city Baku.

The party's stated ideologies are lawfulness, secularism, and Azerbaijani nationalism. It wants to build a "social-oriented" economy, meaning a middle path between socialism and "laissez-faire" capitalism (a mixed economy), and lists civil solidarity and social justice as the basis of its ideology.

Hanok

Hanok is a type of house. It is built in a traditional Korean style of architecture.

The main feature of Hanok is that it has combination of ondol, the Korean under-floor heating system, and wooden floor for heating and cooling. This style is mainly used in Korea because of problems caused by the area having both a continental climate and an oceanic climate.
Hanoks have different shapes in different parts of Korea. In the northern part of the Korean peninsula, Hanok have the structure of a house with several wings. The wings are often built in either a square or the letter L. This helps keep the wind out of the house in the colder northern places and helps keep the house warm. These kind of house also has low roofs. In the warmer southern Korean peninsula, Hanok have a single wing and a wooden floor. This helps let the air in and out.

The Hanok is also different based on the class of the people who live it. Hanok of Upper class people usually have tiled roofs (called "giwa") while lower class houses have roofs made of rice-straw (called "choga"). Hanok for the upper class people are built not only to be homes, but also to be very ornamental.

A cappella

A cappella music is music where people sing without instruments.

In a choir, there are up to 5 parts: soprano, alto, tenor, baritone, and bass. A cappella can also have those 5 parts. A difference is with percussion. With musical instruments, percussion is done with musical instruments that you hit, such as drums. In an a cappella performance, a person makes the percussion sound. For a beatbox performance, performers make sounds like electric drums, synthesizer and electric guitar. Another part of percussion in a cappella performance is making classical drum sounds for tapping the beat.

For the first, scores needed. Especially, scores for a cappella are needed. If someone has an musical knowledge and ability, and are programs for arrangement. Through those programs, you can also listen and practice the songs with ease. 

Normally, there should be at least 4 participants, soprano, alto, tenor or baritone, someone who can do bass and percussion at once. By arranging differently, you can perform only with men or women.

General form of the team would need 6 participants, 1 soprano, 1 alto, 1 tenor, 1 baritone, 1 bass, and 1 percussion. To prepare the performance, there should be two kinds of practice, individual and team one, which means each performer memorize their each part at home and modify the harmony at meeting. In these days, there are additional performances like dancing, storytelling, which is also important, and can make 'a cappella' performance fun and interesting.

There are several kinds of music in a cappella these days, such as barbershop, classical, contemporary, gospel, doo-wop, jazz, and world.

A barbershop group has 4 people. They usually sing religious and dynamic music. The name of this genre originated from the tradition that when many men who gathered in barbershop meet someone who can sing well, they made team and just sang a song with no musical instruments.

In classical a cappella, people perform classical music such as 'a Turkish march', 'Overture William Tell', madrigal, etc.

Contemporary is the most popular kind of a cappella these days. For this kind, the "bass" line should be stronger, and the "chorus" (all the singers except for bass, percussion, and solo) should have variety. The percussion should make their sound more like drums. This genre is similar to 'doo-wop' but the "chorus" part is more complex and has a variety of sound effects.

Doo-wop is also getting more popular because of its simple style. Even though it has simple moto (Italian for "progression of music"), it can be interesting with great vocal and chorus.

Spanking is hitting the buttocks of another person to cause them pain, but without injuring them. Spanking normally involves one person hitting the buttocks of another person with an open hand.

Spanking is used to punish children and teenagers for unacceptable behavior. Historically, boys have been more frequently spanked than girls.

Usually in a spanking, the child lies across the parent's lap, and the parent brings their open hand down upon the child's buttocks. Alternatively, the youngster might be told to bend over, or lie face down across a bed. Spankings may be delivered over the trousers, over the underwear, or on the bare bottom. People who approve of spanking say that the bottom is the safest place to hit the child, since there is little danger of injury to this part of the body.

Environmental chemistry is the chemistry of the natural environment and of pollutant chemicals in nature. But green chemistry wants to reduce and prevent pollution at its source. In 1990, the Pollution Prevention Act was passed in the United States. This law sought original and new ways to handle pollution. It aims to avoid problems before they happen.

Green chemistry applies organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, analytical chemistry and even physical chemistry. While green chemistry seems to focus on just industrial applications, it does apply to any chemistry choice. Click chemistry is often said to be a style of chemical synthesis that has the same aim as green chemistry. Green chemists reduce the hazards and increase the efficiency of any chemical choice. It is distinct from environmental chemistry which focuses on chemical phenomena in the environment.

1. Prevent waste

Create products without or with minimal wastes so that the wastes do not need to be taken care of afterwards.

2. Design safer chemicals and products

Design chemicals to have little or no toxicity, without affecting effectiveness.

3. Design less hazardous chemical syntheses

Design a way of synthesising products without it being toxic to humans or the environment.

4. Use renewable raw materials

Use renewable raw materials, like plant materials, other than depleting ones, such as Fossil fuels.

5. Use catalysts, not stiochiometric reagents

Use of catalysts because of their ability to be able to be reused and that they are less harmful than reagents.

6. Avoid chemical derivatives

Chemical derivatives generate wastes that can be avoided.

7. Maximize atom economy

Make sure that a greater percentage of the atoms present in the reactants of a chemical reaction are used in the products that are also usable.

8. Use safer solvents and reaction conditions

Avoid using harsh solvents, but if that cannot be avoided, then use benign chemicals.

9. Increase energy efficiency

Use the normal ambient temperature and pressure wherever possible.

10. Design for degradation

Design materials to breakdown into benign substances by bacterial or other environmentally sound ways.

11. Analyse in real time to prevent pollution

Monitor and control the formation of by-products during a reaction.

12. Minimize the potential for accidents

Design chemicals to minimize the potential for accidents.

Toastmasters international

Toastmasters International is a global educational organization which helps to improve English speaking skills and communication. In each club, members are led by the Toastmasters Manual to speak in front of an audience fluently, to think quickly and to react confidently.

The first Toastmasters club opened on October 22, 1924, at Santa Ana, California, United States by Ralph C. Smedley. It was called Smedley Club Number 1. Today there are over 13,000 clubs in 116 countries.

A typical Toastmasters club is made up of 20 - 30 people who gather weekly throughout the year. The club meetings last for about two hours and there are many roles. The meetings generally consist of the following:


Anyone age 18 and above and who pays a fee can join the club and improve his/her speaking and communication skills.

Roles:

The Competent Communication Manual is a basic manual for Toastmasters. Members follow it to present ten speeches. Each of the ten topics is dedicated to improving one of the speaker’s basic skills. The skills are:


After completing all ten speeches the member gets a globally recognized certificate and he/she can continue strengthening his/her skills with the Advanced Communication Manuals.

Memristor (memory resistor)

Memristor is a shortcut for English words "memory resistor". It is described as one of the basic elements (resistor, capacitor, inductor) of electronic circuit, because it can’t be replace by any combination of these elements.
This element can change it’s resistivity acording the voltage, but even afrer disconnection it remembers resistivity for unlimited time. It can work like analogi memory or a resistive switch, which can has infinity number of states.

Professor Leon Chua mathematically described this element in 1971.
In 90’s, scientists from HP labs discovered several materials that appeared to be good candidates to construct a hypothetical memristor by Leon Chua.

The four element can change its conductivity by the voltage and after power interruption the size of the resistivity stays the same. No combination of the other three circuit elements can replace a memristor. Only the memristor allows reconfiguring properties so it allows changing a whole electronic circuit. Analogy behaviour is similar to synapses in the brain.

Memristor has a great potential by using in computer science. For example, today computers have to boot from hard drives because data are erased from operation memory immediately after shutting down the computer. The process of booting takes a lot of time and energy. Memristor could be used for quicker data loading because it remembers data even after power interruption. Memristors could be used to speed the booting process.

The first products using memristor technology are expected to become available in 2013.

Geostationary orbit

A geostationary orbit (or Geostationary Earth Orbit - GEO) is a geosynchronous orbit directly above the Earth's equator (0° latitude), with a period equal to the Earth's rotational period and an orbital eccentricity of approximately zero. A person watching from Earth sees a object in a geostationary orbit as motionless, at a fixed position in the sky. Communications satellites and weather satellites often have geostationary orbits, so that the satellite antennas that communicate with them do not have to move to track them. The ground atennas can be pointed permanently at a fixed position in the sky. With fixed 0° latitude and circularity of geostationary orbits, satellites in GEO differ in location by longitude only.

The notion of a geosynchronous satellite for communication purposes was first published in 1928 (but not widely so) by Herman Potočnik. The idea of a geostationary orbit was first disseminated on a wide scale in a 1945 paper entitled "Extra-Terrestrial Relays — Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?" by British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, published in "Wireless World" magazine. The orbit, which Clarke first described as useful for broadcast and relay communications satellites, is sometimes called the Clarke Orbit. Similarly, the Clarke Belt is the part of space about above sea level, in the plane of the equator, where near-geostationary orbits may be implemented. The Clarke Orbit is about long.

The satellite orbits in the direction of the Earth's rotation, at an altitude of above ground, producing an orbital period equal to the Earth's period of rotation, known as the sidereal day.

Weevil

Weevils are herbivorous beetles. They have a long 'snout' at the front of their head, called a "rostrum". Weevils are a family, the Curculionidae, which may be the largest beetle family, with about 45,000+ named living species. That makes it the largest family in the animal kingdom. In addition, the superfamily Curculionoidea has ten more families of closely related weevil-type beetles.

The family has some pests which damage plants of interest to humans. The most famous weevil is the boll weevil, which ruins cotton crops.

The "Ips" genus, feeding on Ponderosa pine, introduces a fungus to the tree. The fungus blocks resin canals, which leaves the weevil free to eat. Resin would normally wash the insects out; it is a defence mechanism. The fungus often kills the tree, and groups of dead trees are a focus for forest fires. In this way the insect is indirectly responsible for serious fires.

The maize weevil, "Sitophilus zeamais", is a major pest. It attacks both standing crops and stored cereal products, including wheat, rice, sorghum, oats, barley, rye, buckwheat, peas, and cottonseed.

4D

4D (four dimensions) is an important idea in geometry.

Three-dimension space has length, depth and height. The fourth dimension is in relation to that three dimensions like a vertical dimension.

In physics the time is considered as a fourth dimension but in real time people are not allowed to perceive it and it is used for modeling physical and social causes.

In mathematics, four-dimension space is an abstract concept which has been studied by mathematics and philosophers for almost three hundred years.

The mathematicians who studied four-dimension space were Möbius, Schläfi, Bernard Riemann, Charles Howard Hinton, etc.

In twentieth century the concept of spacetime was developed. That connects space and time. The difference is that spacetime is not a Euclidean space but it is called "Minkowski continuum". The four-dimension space was mostly studied in the nineteenth century.

Profiling

Profiling is collecting information about someone in order to describe them and/or predict their behaviour and actions. It is often used for criminals or people believed to behaving illegally. More recently used on employees in the work place to improve success

A basic profile consists of an APB (all points bulletin), and is a visual description based on eyewitness information. 

A psychological profile is created in the absence of eyewitness information, or in addition to, using evidence to create a picture of the suspect and help the police force to understand how the suspect is behaving.

Predictive profiling attempts to predict which people might commit crimes in the future.

Criminal profiling – criminal profiling is a tool used by police forces to create a picture or idea of a suspect based on eyewitness information and any other evidence they have.

Some people fear profiling is taken too far by police forces and can lead to harassment and arrest based on skin colour, religious beliefs, culture, nation of origin, or any social type or group that can be stereotyped by characteristic behaviour. 

Behavioural profiling is used in business to help recruit the right person for a job, to understand how to improve morale and to drive down staff turnover, pinpoint who is ready for development and in precisely which areas; and boost people management abilities.

<doc id="317905" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317905" title="Kula">
Kula

Kula is a traditional trade method that takes place in the Milne Bay Province of Papua New Guinea.

The Kula Exchange takes place on eighteen islands, including the Trobriand Islands, and involves thousands of people. The traders involved travel by canoe over hundreds of miles to exchange their Kula valuables. These valuables can be in the form of red shells that are traded to the North of the Islands, or in the form of white-shell armbands, which travel to the South of the Islands. Therefore creating a ‘ring’ of moving valuables throughout the islands. The terms of trade change in different regions. For example, some traders have to exchange a white armband for a necklace or must trade a red shell for a white shell armband. There are also differences on who can take part in the trading process such as in the Trobriand Islands their chiefs mainly take part in the exchange process, whereas in Dobu, anyone can take part. 

The Kula valuables are mainly traded for social status and recognition in the Island region. The people that an individual trades with become trusted trade partners, creating a strong, potentially life-long relationship between the exchange parties. These relationships need trust to be provided on both sides of the trade and also a mutual agreement of safety and support for each other. 

Kula valuables are usually passed on to their trade partners after a certain amount of time, therefore the valuables are always moving around the Kula Ring. The person who originally owned the valuable has full ownership and rights over the item, so he can keep it, sell it or even break it. Every person who therefore receives the item, does not fully own it, as there is always a true owner. This creates a sense of responsibility over how the object is handled by other traders toward the original owner. However, the original owner is sometimes unknown, lost in the Kula Ring.

The ability to take part in the Kula Exchange is not immediately given to just anyone. An individual must “buy” into the system by getting involved in lower trade circles than the Kula. 

The Kula valuables are rated by value and age and so are the relationships created through their exchange. Traders will often try to collect valuable and notorious Kula objects that will boost the status of the trader’s name in the Kula Ring. Kula Exchange is based on trust, strong social obligations and the cultural value system. Those who hold on too long to their Kula valuables gain a bad reputation in the system.

The Kula Exchange system determines many social hierarchies and authoritative positions among the trade islands. For example the chiefs living on the Trobriand Islands in the 1970s owned the most shells and also the most valuable shells. Therefore they were responsible for most of the organization and direction of the trade systems in their region. (The Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea (1988) by Annette B. Weiner) Also, the ten most influential men among all the islands control about 90 per cent of the Kula items. With this amount of control and competition, relationships between traders become fragile and ruined by manipulation and deceit. (Malinowski, B. (1920). "Kula; the Circulating Exchange of Valuables in the Archipelagoes of Eastern New Guinea". Man (Man, Vol. 20) 20: 97–105).

Fa’afafine

A fa’afafine is a boy who is raised as a girl all the way through adulthood. Historically, this has been classified as a third gender in the tradition of Samoan society.

This usually occurs when there are too many sons and not enough daughters in a family. They identify themselves as females in a male’s body. People from societies that do not recognize a third gender may mistake them for being either homosexual or transsexual.

They take on the role of both male and female in the society e.g. teaching, construction and also domestic work. They tend to have sexual intercourse with both sexes, however rarely with another fa’afafine.

Maslenitsa

Maslenitsa is one of the most popular and cheerful religious holidays in Russia. It originated from pagan times before Russia was converted to Christianity. At first, this holiday was a symbol of the spring solstice but nowadays it is considered a Christian holiday which goes right before the Great Lent. During Maslenitsa people enjoy almost any food, except meat. Usually Maslenitsa lasts for seven days and on the last day of this holiday people burn a doll which is made of branches and straw and dressed in bright clothes. This doll is called “Maslenitsa” and it symbolizes the cold and severe winter. By burning “Maslenitsa” people say goodbye to winter and greet a warm spring.

Every day of Maslenitsa plays a great role. On Monday people greet the holiday with games such as sledding, snowballs, riding on swings and so on. Russian people believe that happiness and joy which they feel during this day will accompany them throughout a year. On Tuesday people play games and bake pancakes which are called "blini". Blini are the most popular food which is made during this holiday. These pancakes have a round form and symbolize the Sun and warmth. On Wednesday people usually visit their friends and relatives and treat each other with blini. On Thursday by tradition people try to drive away winter by riding on horses around the village or around the places they live. Friday is usually called “Mothers’-in-law evenings” because sons-in-law come to visit their mothers-in-law. On merry Saturday everyone goes to visit their relatives. All people drink and eat as much as they want and play different games. Sunday is the last day of the holiday. It is also called the "Sunday of forgiveness" because on this day everyone asks forgiveness from relatives and friends for offences and mistakes committed against them. The most appropriate answer is “God will forgive”. After that people usually sing songs, dance and at the end of the day they burn the doll.

Maslenitsa is also considered as a family holiday because spring is a symbol of new life. People who marry during this time are considered as very strong and happy couples who will give a birth to many children. During Maslenitsa some people even “punish” those who did not marry yet by throwing them into snow.

The Blues Band

The Blues Band is a British blues band. The band was formed in 1979 by veteran musicians of British blues of the 1960s.

The band was formed in 1979. 

In the 1960s Paul Jones and Tom McGuinness played for Manfred Mann. Jones worked also as actor and radio DJ.As a harmonica man, he has performed publicly and/or recorded with Memphis Slim, Alexis Korner, Henry Gray, Alvin "Youngblood" Hart, Susan Tedeschi, Eric Bibb and Otis Grand. Hughie Flint was the drummer of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Together with McGuinness he later formed McGuiness Flint who had a hit with "When I´m dead and gone". Dave Kelly was guitarist in the John Dummer Blues Band and in the touring bands of Howlin' Wolf and John Lee Hooker. They played together mostly in London pubs just for fun about playing rhythm ´n blues. 

Their first album ""The Official Blues Band Bootleg Album"" raised no interest with record labels, so they sold it during concerts and via mail order. The record was a fine mixture of blues standards and own songs. Arista signed with the band and the album reached #40 in the charts. 1982 Hughie Flint left the band and was replaced by Rob Townsend. In 1983 they parted but they came together soon. 

When not playing with the Blues Band Jones, McGuinness and Townsend are playing with ""The Manfreds"". The band can be seen as the 1960s Manfred Mann Band without the leader. Dave Kelly plays often with his ""The Dave Kelly Band"".

By playing a lot of concerts all over Europe they had and still have a lot of fans. Till present they recorded over 20 albums. It is said, that three generations of a family can be seen in their concerts.

Acute (medicine)

In medicine, an acute disease is a disease that has either or both of:

This is an adjective. It is part of the definition of many diseases. Because of this, it is in their name, for example, severe acute respiratory syndrome, acute leukemia.

The word acute may often be confused by the general public to mean 'severe'. This is different and something can be acute but not severe.

Acute hospitals are hospitals which are meant for short-term medical and/or surgical treatment and care. The related medical speciality is called acute medicine. 

Subacute is described as between acute and chronic. An example is subacute fever symptoms or subacute endocarditis.
Another example is subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. This is a rare brain disease. One of the symptoms of this disease is less intellectual function, which means someone's brain does not work as it should.

Chronic is the opposite of acute. Chronic means a long term condition, for example chronic bronchitis. Chronic may also be confused by people who do not work in medicine to mean severe. Again, this is a different thing medically and something can be chronic but not severe.

Acute toxicity

Acute toxicity describes the bad effects of a substance that come either from a single exposure or from many exposures in a short amount of time (usually less than 24 hours). To be known as "acute" toxicity, the bad effects should happen within 14 days of the substance thouching something.

Acute toxicity is different from chronic toxicity. Chronic toxicity talks about the bad health effects from many exposures, often at lower levels, to a substance over a longer amount of time (months or years).

It is widely thought to be wrong to use humans as tests for acute (or chronic) toxicity research. However, some information can be picked up from investigating cases when humans accidentally make contact with the substance (e.g., factory accidents). Otherwise, most acute toxicity data comes from animal testing or, more recently, "in vitro" testing methods and inference from data on similar substances.

A street girl selling flowers, Eliza, meets Professor Higgins. Higgins was writing down her pronunciation for his study, but Eliza misunderstood him as a policeman and caused trouble. Higgins says he can make her a duchess. It was changing her pronunciation. Later she remembers what he said and goes to learn pronunciation with a desire to be an upper class woman. 

Higgins decides to do an experiment with her. He deceives all the people at a party. It was making them believe that she is a duchess. After this success, Higgins suggests two options for Eliza. One is marrying based on her beauty. The other is running a flower shop with money from Colonel Pickering who is a rich man. Eliza refuses to do both of them and she leaves his home. Higgins and Colonel Pickering look for Eliza as soon as they know that she left. They find her in Mrs. Higgins’ house but Eliza refuses to go back. She says she would marry Freddy.

George Bernard Shaw is famous for giving audiences a twist by not doing what they expect. In comedy, people expect someone in a bad situation to be in a better one at the end. They expect a poor person to marry a rich man. They expect a villain to be punished. In "Pygmalion", the flower girl in the bad situation gets better in the end. This girl selling flowers on the street rises to the upper class. It was through changing her language.

However, contrary to the audience's expectation, romance between flower girl and Professor Higgins doesn’t happen. She doesn’t marry a rich men. Also, George Bernard Shaw reflected his beliefs to reform the society in this play. 

In the 20th century, there were many poor people on the street. Especially, little girls worked all day for a tiny amount of money. The author had much interest in poor people and women’s freedom. And he believed speech was one of the things that separated rich and poor people. That is the starting point of "Pygmalion". He used the change of language as a means to rise to the upper class. 

In mythology, Pygmalion was a sculptor who did not like women. He couldn’t find a woman to love. And he decided to make a statue, Galatea. In the play, Pygmalion is compared to Professor Higgins. And Galatea is compared to Eliza. Pygmalion made Galatea to be his ideal woman. And Professor Higgins changed Eliza into a perfect upper class woman. He taught her everything from how to talk to how to behave in front of people. This process of making Eliza an upper class woman is criticized as playing with a live doll, as though she didn’t have her own soul. Higgins treats her as an object.

Also, the common expectation of audiences that women’s fate is determined by men is criticized. It is becuase of Eliza’s reaction after the success of pretending to be a duchess. She thought the two options suggested by Higgins would be selling herself. 

When she was selling flowers, at least she didn’t have to sell herself. She doesn’t want to rely on a rich man, but decides to marry a poor man, Freddy. She says she can make something of him. She values love more than anything else.

Mosaic (genetics)

In genetics, a mosaic (or mosaicism) means the presence of two different genotypes in an individual which developed from a single fertilized egg. As a result, the individual has two or more genetically different cell lines derived from a single zygote. 

Mosaicism may result from:

The phenomenon was discovered by Curt Stern. In 1936, he demonstrated that recombination, normal in meiosis, can also take place in mitosis. When it does, it results in somatic (body) mosaics. These are organisms which contain two or more genetically distinct types of tissue.

People who have mosaicism are often called chimeras. This is easiest to see when it affects eye colour. A chimera can have two different coloured eyes if the DNA difference between cells happens to be in an eye-colur gene.

However, there are other possible reasons for having two different-coloured eyes. For example, David Bowie has the appearance of different eye colours due to an injury that caused one pupil to be permanently dilated.

Anti-fan

Anti-fans are the group of people who are opposed to particular person, system, or idea. This word is from a prefix 'anti-', which means 'opposed'. Anti-fans gather and criticize particular thing which they hate.

Anti-fans' activities are very diverse. Anti-fans usually work and share their views in online website. They make anti-fan page. E.g. anti-fan website, anti-fan blog, anti-fan internet cafe etc. And, they criticise their target, spread a rumor about the target, and post malicious comments to Internet articles. Anti-fans also work when they are offline. They sometimes boo and jeer at their target and even start a movement against the target. 

Early their activities used to be constructive criticism, but nowadays the movement of anti-fans is changing to severe insult to their target with no specific reason. The ruthless attack causes a lot of social problems now. A lot of celebrities who are the anti-fans' target are suffering from their behaviors. In some case, they may accuse anti-fans of personal insults. 

Anti-fans' targets are various. The most usual target is entertainer. There are a lot of anti-fans' website for the entertainer who they dislike. E.g. Some anti-fans oppose a form of music, movie, athlete, politician, political party, TV series, idea etc. Surprisingly, the number of anti-fans tends to be proportional to the target's popularity. Thus, the number sometimes becomes a yardstick of star's popularity.

Intelligent anti-fan is one type of anti-fans. Intelligent anti-fans act as if they are the target's real fan and do wrong and bad behaviors as the fan. They intelligently create the target's bad image and gather more anti-fan.

Mountain Pygmy Possum

The Mountain Pygmy Possum ("Burramys parvus") is a small, mouse-sized (weighs 45 g) nocturnal marsupial of Australia. It is found high up (1300 to 2230 metres) in rock screes and boulder fields of southern Victoria and in Kosciuszko National Park, New South Wales.

This possum is a Lazarus taxon, and the only living species in the Burramys genus. It is also the only Australian mammal restricted to an alpine habitat. Its prehensile tail, at ~14 cm, is longer than its 11 cm head and body length. Its diet consists of insects, fleshy fruits, nuts, nectar and seeds. 

The Mountain Pygmy Possum was first described as a Pleistocene fossil by Robert Broom in 1896. It was thought to be extinct until 1966, when a living specimen was discovered in a ski-hut on Mount Hotham.

Three geographically isolated populations are known to exist. These populations have been shown to be genetically distinct. For most of the year, males and females live apart from each other. The females live on the better part of the rocky slopes, while the males live on the margins, usually lower on the mountain. In order to breed, the males migrate to the females' habitat. During the ski season on Mount Higginbotham, the males had to cross a road which put their survival in jeopardy. A "Tunnel of Love" was constructed under the road and a road sign was put in place to warn drivers.

Movie censorship

Censorship in movies is the act of giving a movie a very strong film rating or banning the movie altogether.
The highest film rating label in UK would be 18, which means those under 18 cannot look at, buy or rent any film under this rating. Films with such a rating often have very strong language, explicit sexual content or heavy violence. If the content of the film is higher than the 18 rating, the movie is then banned entirely.
Refused Classification is the very strongest film rating in Australia. This rating means a film has been banned from a particular part of Australia (in some cases, the entire area). This rating is tagged onto films which the Australian Classification Board has declared too severe for viewing by general public.
The highest film rating is NC-17, which means No Children 17 and Under Admitted. Such movies contain strong sexual content, very strong violence or extremely graphic language and are usually considered too intense for an R rating.

Monsanto process

The Monsanto process is a way of making acetic acid. It uses a catalyst to add a carbonyl group to methanol. This process operates at a pressure of 30–60 atm and a temperature of 150–200 °C. It gives a selectivity greater than 99%. It was developed 1960 by German chemists working at BASF. Chemists at Monsanto introduced a new catalyst system in 1966. Tody, chemist make acetic acid by the Cativa process, a similar iridium-based process developed by BP Chemicals Ltd which is more economical and environmentally friendly. So, the Monsanto process is not used very much in industry.

The process has several steps, which repeat to remake the catalyst:
The catalytically active species is the anion cis-[Rh(CO)I] (1). The catalytic cycle has been shown to involve six steps, two of which do not involve rhodium: conversion of methanol to methyl iodide and the hydrolysis of the acetyl iodide to acetic acid. (These steps are in the middle of the above diagram.) The first organometallic step is the oxidative addition of methyl iodide to "cis"-[Rh(CO)I] to form the hexacoordinate species [(CH)Rh(CO)I] (2). This anion rapidly transforms, by the migration of a methyl group to the carbonyl ligand, affording the pentacoordinate acetyl complex [(CHCO)Rh(CO)I] (3). This five-coordinate complex then reacts with carbon monoxide to form the six coordinate dicarbonyl complex. (4) This decomposes by reductive elimination to form acetyl iodide (CHCOI) and regenerate the active form of the catalyst. Acetyl iodide is then hydrolyzed to acetic acid.

The reaction mechanism is first-order with respect to methyl iodide and the catalyst (1). Hence the rate-determining step of the catalytic cycle has been proposed to be the oxidative addition of methyl iodide to the catalyst (1). Chemist think that this occurs with the rhodium center making a nucleophilic attack on the carbon of methyl iodide.

The Monsanto process for making acetic acid inspired chemists to invent a way to make Acetic anhydride. It is produced by carbonylation of methyl acetate.

In this process lithium iodide converts methyl acetate to lithium acetate and methyl iodide, which in turn affords through carbonylation acetyl iodide. Acetyl iodide reacts with acetate salts or acetic acid to give the product. Rhodium iodides and lithium salts are employed as catalysts. Because acetic anhydride is not stable in water, the conversion is conducted under water-free (anhydrous) conditions in contrast to the Monsanto acetic acid synthesis.

Endogamy

Endogamy is the idea that a person ought to marry another person from the same group as them. The type of group isn’t always the same; it could be based on a religion, a class or a social group. Often group endogamy is enforced by arranged marriages, this is a system based on benefits for the group rather than marriage for love.

By marrying a person with the same group characteristics, it means that the partners will have similar views or beliefs about something. Many people marry endogamously for reasons of compatibility, which can be due to choice. But there are also other reasons when there is less choice involved or there is disapproval if it is not followed.

By doing this it keeps the numbers of a group to a minimum and thus creates stronger group bonds. For example, when moving to another country, a Sikh family may actively look for other Sikh families to mix with in order to facilitate Sikh marriages. By merging, they create a stronger bond between their own communities and can be a way to deal with being a minority.

If a group has been marrying endogamously for a long period of time the gene pool may be smaller and there is a greater chance of genetic disease. For example, within the Jewish community Tay-Sachs disease is a common genetic disease.

<doc id="318123" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=318123" title="Exogamy">
Exogamy

Exogamy is when a person ought to marry someone from outside a certain group.

In most places, exogamy is practiced in order to avoid incest, which is taboo in many groups across the world. This is to avoid some of the effects that endogamy creates such as genetic diseases. If two parents have very different genes then there is a lesser chance of a child inheriting both copies of that gene.

Exogamy is used to make a connection between two groups. For example, when a person marries another they become part of the family. This connection may be for reasons of inter-group cohesion. In other words, creating an alliance with another group.

Claude Levi-Strauss, an anthropologist, argued that when two families are connected by the marriage of two people it creates more relationships for trading other things such as food. It also means that they have more people to rely on. In order to keep this going, groups with trade sisters/daughters for wives and trade back in return.

Throw out the baby with the bath water

Throw out the baby with the bath water is an idiom.

The phrase describes a special kind of mistake which happens when something good is lost while trying to get rid of something bad. 

The idiom summarizes what happens when something which is necessary is rejected along with what is not necessary.

A slightly different explanation focuses on the loss of the essential while holding on to what is not essential. In other words, the idiom is applicable not only when it's a matter of throwing out the baby with the bath water, but also when someone might throw out the baby and keep the bath water.

This idiom comes from a German proverb, "das Kind mit dem Bade ausschütten." In 1512, "Narrenbeschwörung" ("Appeal to Fools") by Thomas Murner includes a woodcut picture showing a woman tossing a baby out with waste water.

The meaning and intent are sometimes mirrored in different terms.

In navigation, the word bearing is used for different methods that try to find out the angle between an object used for this purpose, and a reference direction. There are different systems of reference, that can be used for this. A system of reference that is commomly used is that of Cardinal directions, as they can be found with a compass. Very often, points that can easily be determined, and that move very little are taken as reference. Such points include stars, mountains, the sun, and beacons. Beacons come in the form of lighthouses on the coast, but also as electric beacons or oher sea marks on the open sea.

Roderick MacKinnon

Roderick MacKinnon (born 19 February 1956) is a professor of Molecular Neurobiology and Biophysics at Rockefeller University. He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry together with Peter Agre in 2003 for his work on the structure and operation of ion channels.

MacKinnon was born in Burlington, Massachusetts and initially attended the University of Massachusetts Boston. MacKinnon then transferred to Brandeis University after one year, and there he received a bachelor's degree in biochemistry in 1978, studying calcium transport through the cell membrane for his honors thesis in Christopher Miller's laboratory. It was also at Brandeis where MacKinnon met his future wife and working-colleague Alice Lee.

After receiving his degree from Brandeis, MacKinnon entered medical school at Tufts University. He got his M.D. in 1982 and received training in Internal Medicine at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. He did not feel satisfied enough with the medical profession, so in 1986 he returned to Christopher Miller's laboratory at Brandeis for postdoctoral studies.

In 1989 he was appointed assistant professor at Harvard University where he studied the interaction of the potassium channel with a specific toxin taken from scorpion venom. He learned how to purify proteins and to use X-ray crystallography. In 1996, he moved to Rockefeller University as a professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology and Biophysics. There, he started to work on the structure of the potassium channel. These channels are of particular importance to the nervous system and the heart. The channels enable potassium ions to cross the cell membrane.

Potassium channels demonstrate a seemingly strange activity: they permit the passage of potassium ions, whereas they do not allow the passage of the much smaller sodium ions. Before MacKinnon's work, the detailed molecular architecture of potassium channels and the exact means by which they conduct ions remained speculative. In 1998, despite barriers to the structural study of integral membrane proteins that had stopped most attempts for decades, MacKinnon and colleagues determined the three-dimensional molecular structure of a potassium channel from bacteria utilizing X-ray crystallography. With this structure and other biochemical experiments, MacKinnon and colleagues were able to explain the exact mechanism by which potassium channel selectivity occurs.

His prize-winning research was conducted primarily at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) of Cornell University, and at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) of Brookhaven National Laboratory.

Cluny Abbey

Cluney Abbey is a Benedictine abbey in Cluny. It was built in Romanesque style and its three churches date rom the 10th to the 12th century. It was founded by William I of Aquitaine in the year 910. Soon the place was noted because it followed the Rule of St. Benedict more strictly than the place where the rule was developed, that is Subiaco in Italy. Cluny became the leader of a movement called monasticism. The abbey also started the Cluniac Reforms, and was subject only to the pope, Sergius III at the time. The Benedictine order was very important for the stability of f European society at the time.In 1790, during the French Revolution, the abbey was sacked, and mostly destroyed. Today, only very little of the original remains. 

Dating around 1334, the abbots of Cluny had a townhouse in Paris known as the Hôtel de Cluny, what is now a public museum since 1833. Apart from the name, it no longer possesses anything originally connected with Cluny.

Irish rebellion of 1798

The Irish rebellion of 1798 was an uprising of Irish people against British rule in Ireland. It was led by Wolfe Tone and consisted primarily of a secret society called the United Irish. It was aided by Republican France. However, it never gained much traction due to its alliance with anti-Catholic France, because Ireland was primarily Catholic. Despite the British government's anti-Catholicism, most Irish Catholics supported the Crown as the lesser of two evils because of the issue of Revolutionary France's involvement. The uprising lasted several months. A group called the United Irishmen were the main driving force in the rebellion. They were influenced by revolutions taking place in America and France around the time. The uprising is also known as United Irishmen Rebellion.
Between 10.000 and 50.000 people died as casualties on the Irish side, between 500 and 2000 on the English side.

<doc id="318219" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=318219" title="Volcanic winter">
Volcanic winter

A volcanic winter is a climate cooling caused by an extremely large volcanic eruption. Such an eruption releases ash and sulfur dioxide in huge quantities. They form aerosols of sulfuric acid. When they reach the stratosphere more sunlight is reflected, and some is absorbed by the stratosphere. These reactions heat up the stratospherte, but lead to a drop in the temperature on the ground. 

The Siberian Traps, Emeishan Traps, and Deccan Traps are huge flood basalt provinces caused by volcanism. They are the cause, or part of the cause, of several mass extinctions, especially the Permian–Triassic extinction event. 

Nuclear winter is the name of a similar effect, caused by many nuclear explosions, esp. over burning cities.

The effects of recent volcanic eruptions on winters are modest in scale but historically their effects have been significant.
Most recently, the 1991 explosion of Mount Pinatubo, a stratovolcano in the Philippines, cooled global temperatures for about 2–3 years.

In 1883, the explosion of Krakatoa (Krakatau) created volcanic winter-like conditions. The next four years after the explosion were unusually cold, and the winter of 1887 to 1888 included powerful blizzards. Record snowfalls were recorded worldwide.

The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora, a stratovolcano in Indonesia, occasioned mid-summer frosts in New York State and June snowfalls in New England and Newfoundland and Labrador in what came to be known as the "Year without a Summer" of 1816.

A paper written by Benjamin Franklin in 1783 blamed the unusually cool summer of 1783 on volcanic dust coming from Iceland, where the eruption of Laki volcano had released enormous amounts of sulfur dioxide, resulting in the death of much of the island's livestock and a catastrophic famine which killed a quarter of the population. Temperatures in the northern hemisphere dropped by about 1 °C in the year following the Laki eruption.

In 1600, the Huaynaputina in Peru erupted. Tree ring studies show that 1601 was cold. Russia had its worst famine in 1601 to 1603. From 1600 to 1602, Switzerland, Latvia and Estonia had exceptionally cold winters. The wine harvest was late in 1601 in France, and in Peru and Germany wine production collapsed. Peach trees bloomed late in China, and Lake Suwa in Japan froze early.

In 1452 or 1453, a cataclysmic eruption of the submarine volcano Kuwae caused worldwide disruptions.

The Great Famine of 1315–1317 in Europe may have been precipitated by a volcanic event, perhaps that of Kaharoa, New Zealand, which lasted about five years.

<doc id="318262" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=318262" title="Cosmic distance ladder">
Cosmic distance ladder

The cosmic distance ladder (also known as the extragalactic distance scale) is the way astronomers measure the distance of objects in space. No one method works for all objects and distances, so astronomers use a number of methods.

A real "direct" distance measurement of an astronomical object is possible only for those objects that are close enough to Earth (within about a thousand parsecs). It is the larger distances which are the problem. Several methods rely on a standard candle, which is an astronomical object that has a known standard luminosity.

The ladder analogy arises because no one technique can measure distances at all ranges encountered in astronomy. Instead, one method can be used to measure nearby distances, a second can be used to measure nearby to intermediate distances, and so on. Each rung of the ladder provides information that can be used to determine the distances at the next higher rung.

The astronomical unit is the mean (average) distance of the Earth from the Sun. This we know quite accurately. Radar bounce off artificial satellites and inner planets provide the data, then the result is worked out by computer. 

Parallax is the use of trigonometry to discover the distances of objects near to the solar system.

As the Earth orbits around the Sun, the position of nearby stars will appear to shift slightly against the more distant background. These shifts are angles in a right triangle, with 2 AU making the short leg of the triangle and the distance to the star being the long leg. The amount of shift is quite small, measuring 1 arcsecond for an object at a distance of 1 parsec (3.26 light-years)

This method works for distances up to a few hundred parsecs.

Objects of known brightness are called "standard candles". Most physical distance indicators are standard candles. These are objects which belong to a class that has a known brightness. By comparing the known luminosity of the latter to its observed brightness, the distance to the object can be computed using the inverse square law. 

In astronomy, the brightness of an object is given in terms of its absolute magnitude. This quantity is derived from the logarithm of its luminosity as seen from a distance of 10 parsecs. The apparent magnitude is the magnitude as seen by the observer. It can be used to determine the distance "D" to the object in kiloparsecs (kiloparsec = 1,000 parsecs) as follows:

where "m" the apparent magnitude and "M" the absolute magnitude. For this to be accurate, both magnitudes must be in the same frequency band and there can be no relative motion in the radial direction.

Some means of accounting for interstellar extinction, which also makes objects appear fainter and more red, is also needed. The difference between absolute and apparent magnitudes is called the distance modulus, and astronomical distances, especially intergalactic ones, are sometimes tabulated in this way.

Two problems exist for any class of standard candle. The principal one is calibration, finding out exactly what the absolute magnitude of the candle is. 

The second lies in recognizing members of the class. The standard candle calibration does not work unless the object belongs to the class. At extreme distances, which is where one most wishes to use a distance indicator, this recognition problem can be quite serious.

A significant issue with standard candles is the question of how standard they are. For example, all observations seem to indicate that Type Ia supernovae that are of known distance have the same brightness. The possibility that the distant Type Ia supernovae have different properties than nearby Type Ia supernovae exists.

With few exceptions, distances based on direct measurements are available only up to about a thousand parsecs, which is a modest portion of our own Galaxy. For distances beyond that, measures depend upon physical assumptions, that is, the assertion that one recognizes the object in question, and the class of objects is homogeneous enough that its members can be used for meaningful estimation of distance.

Physical distance indicators, used on progressively larger distance scales, include:



In a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram the absolute magnitude for a group of stars is plotted against the spectral classification of the stars. Evolutionary patterns are found that relate to the mass, age and composition of the star. In particular, during their hydrogen burning period, stars lie along a curve in the diagram called the main sequence. 

By measuring the properties from a star's spectrum, the position of a main sequence star on the H-R diagram can be found. From this the star's absolute magnitude is estimated. A comparison of this value with the apparent magnitude allows the approximate distance to be determined, after correcting for interstellar extinction of the luminosity because of gas and dust.

In a gravitationally-bound star cluster such as the Hyades, the stars formed at approximately the same age and lie at the same distance. This allows relatively accurate main sequence fitting, providing both age and distance determination.

This is not a complete list of methods, but it does show the ways astronomers go about estimating the distance of astronomical objects.

Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search

The Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search, or SWEEPS, was a 2006 astronomical survey project. It used the Hubble Space Telescope to watch 180,000 stars for seven days. They did this to find extrasolar planets.

The stars that were watched in this survey were all in the Sagittarius-I Window.

Sixteen planets were discovered. They took from 0.6 to 4.2 days to orbit the sun. Planets which took less 1.2 days to orbit the sun have not been detected before. Because of this, they were called "ultra-short period planets" (USPPs) by the search team. USPPs were discovered only around low-mass stars. This means that larger stars might have destroyed any planets orbiting so closely, or that planets could not move as far inward around larger stars.

The planets SWEEPS-4 and SWEEPS-11 orbited stars that looked so different from their neighbors that the SWEEPS scientists could watch the planets more. This allowed them to find the mass of the planets.

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a type of mass spectrometry that is highly sensitive. It can see a range of metals and several non-metals at concentrations below one part in 10 (part per trillion). It is based on hooking together an inductively coupled plasma as a method of producing ions (ionization) with a mass spectrometer as a method of separating and detecting the ions. Many chemists use Argon as a carrier gas to make the plasma. The machine sends the sample ions through a series of small cones. The cones let the plasma ions slowly enter the vacuum chamber of the mass spectrometer.

In trace elemental analysis, the method has advantages of high speed, precision and sensitivity compared to atomic absorption techniques. Analysis of lower concentrations at the same time is more prone to disruption by trace contaminants in labware and reagents used. Some analytes can not work with ICP-MS. Verification of analysis results requires additional work.

The variety of applications exceeds that of ICP-OES and includes isotopic speciation. Because ICP-MS can help make atom bombs, ICP-MS hardware is a subject for special exporting regulations.

4-H

4-H in the United States is a youth organization administered by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), with the mission of "engaging youth to reach their fullest potential while advancing the field of youth development." The name represents four personal development areas for the organization's members: head, heart, hands, and health. The organization has over 6.5 million members in the United States. Members are five to 19 years old, in approximately 90,000 clubs.

The goal of 4-H is to develop citizenship, leadership, responsibility and life skills of youth through experiential learning programs and a positive youth development approach. Many people think of 4-H as an agriculturally-focused organization as a result of its history. But 4-H today focuses on citizenship, healthy living, science, engineering, and technology programs.

Today, 4-H and related programs exist in over eighty countries around the world. The organization and administration varies from country to country. Each of these programs operates independently. They cooperate in international exchanges, global education programs, and communications.

The 4-H motto is "To make the best better", while its slogan is "Learn by doing" (sometimes written as "Learn to do by doing").

The start of 4-H began around 1900, with the work of several people in different parts of the United States. The focal point of 4-H has been the idea of practical and hands-on learning, which came from the desire to make public school education more connected to rural life. Early programs tied both public and private resources together to benefit rural youth.

During this time, researchers at agricultural experiment stations of the land-grant universities and USDA saw that adult farmers did not readily accept new agricultural discoveries, but educators found that youth would experiment with these new ideas and then share their experiences and successes with the adults. So, rural youth programs became a way to introduce new agriculture technology to the adults.
A. B. Graham started one of the youth programs in Clark County, Ohio, in 1902, which is considered the birth of the 4-H program in the United States. The first club was called "The Tomato Club" or the "Corn Growing Club". T.A. "Dad" Erickson of Douglas County, Minnesota, started local agricultural after-school clubs and fairs also in 1902. Jessie Field Shambaugh developed the clover pin with an H on each leaf in 1910, and, by 1912, they were called 4-H clubs. The national 4-H organization was formed in 1914. When the United States Congress created the Cooperative Extension Service (CES) of the USDA by passage of the Smith-Lever Act of 1914, it included within the CES charter the work of various boys' and girls' clubs involved with agriculture, home economics and related subjects. By 1924, these clubs became organized as 4-H clubs, and the clover emblem was adopted.

The first 4-H camp was held in Randolph County, West Virginia. Originally, these camps were for what was referred to as "Corn Clubs". Campers slept in corn fields, in tents, only to wake up and work almost the entirety of each day. Superintendent of schools G. C. Adams began a boys' corn club in Newton County, Georgia, in 1904. However, the city of Jacksboro, Texas, also stakes a claim to having the first forerunner to 4-H in 1910.

4-H membership hit an all-time high in 1974 as a result of its popular educational program about nutrition, "Mulligan Stew", shown in schools and on television across the country.

Emeishan Traps

The Emeishan Traps is a flood basalt volcanic province in Southwestern China, around Sichuan province. Many igneous rock types can be found there. This is known as large igneous province in geology. Other names for the traps include Permian Emeishan Large Igneous Province, and other variations. The Traps are the step-like rock made up of many layers of basalt, which were laid down by successive eruptions of magma. 

The eruptions that lead to the Emeshian traps began about 260 million years ago. The traps are much smaller than the Siberian Traps, which occurred not long afterwards, about 251 million years ago. Despite this, the Emeshian traps were large enough to have an impact on the ecology of the time, and on paleontology. They can be associated with mass extinction events that occurred at the end of the Guadalupian epoch of the Permian period.

As such, the Emeishan Traps form one aspect of the larger scientific debate on the causes of mass extictions. The end-Guadalupian extinction occurred at almost the same time as the Emeshian Traps were formed. This fact has been used to support the argument, that volcanism is the main driving force behind mass extinctions. Another theory that has been proposed to explain mass extinctions is that meteor or comet impact events caused them. In this context, the hypothesis is that impact events cause flood basalt eruptions, such as those which generated the Emeshian Traps. This hypothesis is controversial, though.

Mucous membrane

The mucous membranes (or mucosae; singular mucosa) are skin-like linings of mostly endodermal origin. They are covered in epithelium, which are involved in absorption and secretion. They line cavities that are exposed to the external environment and internal organs. They are at several places contiguous with skin: at the nostrils, the mouth, the lips, the eyelids, the ears, the genital area, and the anus. Unlike skin which has hair growing out of it, mucous membranes are hairless.

The sticky, thick fluid secreted by the mucous membranes and glands is called "mucus". The term "mucous membrane" refers to where they are found in the body and not every mucous membrane secretes mucus.

Knob and tube wiring

Knob and tube wiring (abbreviated K&T) was an early type of electrical wiring. In knob and tube wiring, wires were held to the wooden structure by ceramic "knobs", and were protected by ceramic "tubes" when they went through a piece of wood. Wires were held to the knobs by another piece of non-conducting wire. A material called loom protected the wire when it entered a junction box, which usually contained an outlet, switch, or light fixture. Splices were soldered together and wrapped in cloth electrical tape. The insulation on knob and tube wiring was usually cotton cloth soaked in asphalt. To prevent short circuits, the hot and neutral wires were kept far apart. This is not necessary on modern wiring because modern insulation alone is enough to prevent short circuits. Knob and tube wiring did not have a ground wire and therefore did not have three-prong outlets. Most electrical codes allow the use of a GFCI to update knob and tube outlets to three-prong without installing any new wire.

Knob and tube wiring used cloth insulation. Over time this insulation can wear out, become brittle, and fall off, leaving bare wire. The ceramic knobs and tubes provide some protection because even if the insulation does fall off, the bare wire can not touch the wooden structure. The insulation is also somewhat flammable. Unlike modern wiring, splices were not contained in a protective box. If a splice failed, it could make a spark and start a fire. The fuse boxes usually had no protection from using an incorrect fuse. An incorrect fuse could cause the wiring to overheat and become damaged or start a fire. Another problem is that when a fuse blew, people who didn't know or didn't care about the hazards would sometimes replace it with a coin or a ball of foil if a replacement fuse wasn't available, leaving no overload protection at all. These issues can be partially corrected by installing a modern circuit breaker panel with arc fault circuit interrupter breakers. There was also no ground wire. Knob and tube can be updated with a GFCI to add the equivalent of grounding.

Unlike modern wiring, knob and tube supply and return wires were not always alongside each other. In the oldest installations, several branch circuits could share the same neutral wire, which can cause overloads. To prevent overloads in this layout, the neutral wires were protected with fuses. If a neutral fuse blew or was removed, it could create a dangerous condition where the power appeared to be off, but was in fact still present. Three-way switches could also be wired in such a way that the outer ring of a lamp socket, which is normally connected to neutral, could be connected to hot, which is an electric shock hazard.

<doc id="318375" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=318375" title="Post-postmodernism">
Post-postmodernism

Post-Postmodernism is a general term used to describe new developments emerging from Postmodernism. It is a positive idea that faith, sincerity and trust can be better for society Postmodern irony. Postmodernism is a way of thinking about culture and thought. It often challenges the certainty and authority of vital areas of our lives. However, as an almost sixty year-old term many do not think it is relevant to how we live our lives now and suggest a positive, earnest look at the world we live in.

Modernism began in the late 19th Century as a rejection of tradition and an attempt to see the world differently. It is associated with the Enlightenment. Events such as World War 2 and the Great Depression made many feel Modernism had failed. This led to Postmodernism, which is cold and skeptical of the grand narrative of Western Society. This grand narrative is explained by Jean-François Lyotard as something . Postmodernism is a very broad term that cannot be defined by specific themes. It is an all-encompassing way of thinking.

Postmodernism is seen as a theory for explaining 20th Century culture. With the 20th Century now behind us and a new century beginning, many have suggested that Postmodernism is outdated in our current world. Advances such as the Internet, Mobile Phones and Television have changed the way we live, making the world a smaller place but also making communication and interaction with things around us less intimate. Post-Postmodernism takes this as a key reason why a return to sincerity and authentic expression is the way forward for the 21st Century. 

Post-Postmodernism is a very new idea that is still forming. There are many different ideas about how Post-Postmodernism could evolve and shape culture.

Zygmunt Bauman uses the term Liquid Modernity to refer to the freedom of ideas, information and people. It draws upon the global nature of society. Distinct cultures, ideas and categories are meeting and fusing in the 21st Century. It has been called "a world of fragmented and incommensurate identities and personae". Liquid Modernity is a powerful reaction to Postmodernism as it states that through privitisation and the global economy, we are now free to determine our own existence and path in the world.

In 2010 Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin Van Den Akker wrote an article called 'Notes on Metamodernism' that characterised life today as an oscillation between the realism of Postmodernism and the idealism of Modernism. They believe the two can work together, and that modern culture is based on navigating these oppositions. They list as opposing forces that a big variety of artists, theorists and creatives constantly alternate between.

Jesse Thorn's public radio show The Sound of Young America put forward the phrase 'New Sincerity'. Thorn says that some people and things in modern life are so entertaining and genuine that they can only be enjoyed sincerely, without irony. Using Evel Knievel as an example, he says: "Here is a real man who feels at home as Spidey on the cover of a comic book. Simply put, Evel Knievel boggles the mind." New Sincerity is a popular culture movement that shares many ideas with post-postmodernism.

German-American Slavist Raoul Eshelman wrote in his book "Performatism, Or the End of Postmodernism" that many new cultural documents present viewers with simple, identifiable characteristics that are powerful. By making us aware of the artificial and set conditions of a piece of work, he believes we can have a genuine, sincere experience. His main example is the film American Beauty.

As an art movement, Altermodernism is a reaction to what Nicolas Bourriaud calls 'the standardisation of culture'. It was first discussed at the Altermodern Tate Triennial. In his manifesto Bourriaud says that "Increased communication, travel and migration are affecting the way we live". He calls contemporary existence "a cultural landscape saturated with signs". This means that we are overloaded with information and overlapping of cultures and ways of living. Bourriaud believes art is a way to create new pathways and find meaning in modern society.

Exercise physiology is the study of the acute responses and chronic adaptations to a wide-range of physical exercise conditions. In addition, many exercise physiologists study the effect of exercise on pathology, and the mechanisms by which exercise can reduce or reverse disease progression. Professional bodies in most developed countries review and approve education programs to ensuring the quality and consistency of education.

An exercise physiologist's area of study may include but is not limited to biochemistry, bioenergetics, cardiopulmonary function, hematology, biomechanics, skeletal muscle physiology, neuroendocrine function, and central and perpheral nervous system function. Also, exercise physiologists range from basic scientists, to clinical researchers, to clinicians, to sports trainers.

Otto Haberstroh grew up in Freiburg im Breisgau . After marrying Maria Haberstroh (née Jäckle) he went to Rio Grande/Brazil. His son Heinz Haberstroh was born there on 14 October 1930. Otto Haberstroh came back to Germany in 1939 an worked as work leader in the cloth company in Glauchau/Saxony. 

He was one of the founders of the CDU local group Glauchau, very fond of working in the CDU and was therefore attacked by the SED in the press. Because of the SED he was seized and brought to the NKWD on 19 November 1948. He was accused of having done "propaganda for national socialism and spying the economy" when he was working in Brazil. Although he was able to prove he has done nothing wrong, he was kept in prison until 10 May 1949. He was let out because of his bad health and fled to Western Germany. So he was not judged in the "Waldheimer Prozessen".

Later he became work leader of Bayer Dormagen.

Short circuit

A short circuit is a problem in an electrical circuit where two or more wires that are not supposed to come in contact with each other touch. A short circuit can result in a very high current flowing through the circuit. This high current can destroy components, melt insulation, and start a fire. Circuit breakers and fuses are devices that detect short circuits and shut the power off before any damage can be done.

Circuit breaker

A circuit breaker is a device designed to shut off an electrical circuit when too much current is flowing. This usually occurs if too many devices are plugged in or if there is a short circuit. Circuit breakers are usually installed in the electrical panel. Some circuit breakers also have GFCI protection. Inside the circuit breaker, there is usually an electromagnetic coil. When too much current flows through the coil, it pulls on the switch, shutting the power off. The coil reacts to immediate short circuits. There is also a metal strip that will bend and pull on the switch if it gets too hot. This reacts to extended periods of too much current. Some advanced circuit breakers monitor current electronically, and shut the power off when an electronic sensor detects too much current. A circuit breaker does the same job as a fuse, but unlike a fuse, a circuit breaker does not need to be replaced to be reset.

The Merchant of Venice

The Merchant of Venice is a comedy written by William Shakespeare which is quite early work of his own. This play is usually classified as comedy, on the other hand, it is controversial whether this is a comedy since Shylock, the character who plays villain, is questionable if he is a real villain. The Merchant of Venice is mainly about courtship story between a young Venitian and a beautiful lady who is bound to choose her husband by following her dead father's will. His friend, the merchant of Venice, borrows money from a Jew because for the Venitian lover, and this story brings the issue dealing justice. 

Venice is a prosperous city with a lot of merchants with fortunes. Antonio is a Christian and also one of the richest merchants in the Venice, also known for his kindness and generosity. His friend, Bassanio is also very noble man, but he loses most of his fortune by his misbehavior in earlier days. Bassanio falls in love with a woman named Portia, who is a beautiful and wealth heiress in Belmont. He asks Antonio to lend him money so he can become a suitor. Because all his ships are out there pacific, Antonio goes to Shylock, a Jew money lender, and borrows money. As a Christian, Antonio has hard feelings over Jews, especially on Shylock. And so does Shylock, since he is hated. However, Shylock agrees to lend three thousands ducat to Bassanio without any interests, under the condition that Antonio is bounded to the contract and Antonio's a pound of flesh becomes the forfeit. 

In the Belmont, Portia complains the fact that whoever chooses the right casket among three will be her husband. She thinks that her life, a live women's, is decided by her dead father's will and thinks it's unfair. So the suitors arrive. First the prince of Morocco, a moorish noble man comes and chooses golden casket. Instead of Portia's portrait, the sign that he has chosen the right one, he finds out a skull and a scroll. Because the prince's choice is not the right one, he gives up and leaves her. Next, the prince of Arragon comes and he also chooses a casket. He chooses a silver one and it isn't the right one, neither. He also admits that he fails and leaves her. 

Meanwhile, Jessica, the only daughter of Shylock, expresses her hatred over her blood, being a Jew and desire to become a Christian. Her lover, Lorenzo, promises her new life and they decides to run away together. On the festival day when people disguise themselves in masks, Jessica disguise herself as a man and with all his fathers jewels and money, she leaves her father. Shylock discovers that his own daughter has disowned him and she even takes away all his fortunes. Also, all of Antonio's ships are reported to lost in the sea. 

Finally, Bassanio arrives at Belmont and he chooses right casket, the one made with lead. Portia expresses great happiness. While they are enjoying their happy moment, the startling news surprises Antonio, which is from Antonio that tells Bassanio that he is going to be forfeited because his lose of all his ships. Bassanio decides to his return to Venice right away. While he prepares to leave Belmont, Portia gives him a ring to keep it. Bassanio promises her to keep it with him all the time. 

After they leave, Portia sends her cousin, doctor Bellario, letter and disguises to him, the judge. As a judge, she attends to the trial of Shylock and Antonio. Following the contract and the law, Portia admits that Shylock has right to takes a pound of flesh from Antonio, but he is not allowed to make Antonio bleed since it is not part of the contract. Being unable to take a pound of flesh without shedding a drop of blood, Shylock gives up his forfeiture. Portia also announces that a Jew tires to harm a Christian, as the punishment, following Venitian law, half of Shylock fortune has to be taken away as the city's budget.

A Painful Case

"A Painful Case" is a short story, written by James Joyce, an Irish author. This short story is one of the series which was published in his 1914 series. A Painful Case, is a story which shows loneliness and isolation of the two characters named Mr. James Duffy, referred as Mr. Duffy, and Mrs. Emily Sinico, referred as Mrs. Sinico. The overall plot describes the life of Mr. Duffy and his character as a lonely person who encountered with one woman by accident. In the story, Mr. Duffy is portrayed as a person who is solitude. To describe his daily routine, every morning, he sets out for work from Chapelizold by tram. On afternoon, he goes to Dan Burk’s and eats his lunch there; a bottle of larger beer and small trayful of arrowroot biscuits. On four o’ clock, he’s free. “He dined in an eating house in George’s street where he felt himself safe from the society o Dublin’s gilded youth and where there was a certain plain honesty in the bill of fare.” (23) Him having a same occupation after four years, his daily routine does not change as well. “His evenings were spent either before his landlady’s piano or roaming about the outskirts of the city.” (23) This was what he does everyday evening. He does nothing special, this just continues throughout his whole life. Moreover, he doesn’t have any friends or companions; he enjoys his own spiritual life without interaction with other people. He visits his family and relatives only in Christmas or and funeral, only when someone in his family passes away. His only hobby is to attend opera or concerts since he is a fan of Mozart’s music. 

One evening, Mr. Duffy attends a concert in the Rotunda and there, he notices one lady who is sitting next to him. When Mrs. Sinico makes a comment about the unluckily small audience, he takes this as an invitation to talk to her, and they do talk. Mrs. Sinico has an attractive face, looking intelligent. After few weeks pass, Mr. Duffy meets Mrs. Sinico again, at a concert in Earlsfort Terrace. This time, he has an opportunity to be close to her while Mrs. Sinico’s daughter’s attention diverts to become intimate. While having a conversation with Mrs Sinico, Mr. Duffy figures out that she has a husband, but he doesn’t feel cautious of her. Mr. Duffy and Mrs. Sinico meet a third time by accident, and Mr. Duffy asks her to meet him again sometime. After that, they become to see each other often, in Mrs. Sinico’s house. Mr. Duffy lends his books and music to Mrs. Sinico and shares his intellectual life with her. By this time, they become very close to each other. Mr. Duffy and Mrs Sinico spends more and more time together in Mrs. Sinico’s house, sometimes in Mrs. Sinico’s college. Together, they speak some personal matters. Mrs. Sinico stays with Mr. Duffy until the dark came. The two are alike, having many things in common. One night, when they talk about their undefeatable loneliness and Mrs. Sinico “had shown every sign of unusual excitement, caught up his hand passionately and pressed it to her cheek.” (25) Mr. Duffy is astonished by her action and she had misunderstood him that she thought he’s feeling what she feels. Mr. Duffy became disillusioned by how Mrs. Sinico interpretes his words. After this incident, Mr. Duffy doesn’t visit her for a week and finally sends a mail to meet her. In the end, they agree they cannot meet again and they eventually end the intercourse. Four year passes and Mr. Duffy returns to his normal life. He avoids concerts, because he is afraid for chances of seeing her. One night he reads a newspaper while he is eating, and as soon as he sees something, he stops eating. He reads the same words again and again and is unable to finish his meal. When he goes back to his house, he reads it again, and it is about the death of Mrs. Sinico. “Mrs. Emily Sinico, aged forty-three years, was killed at Sydney Parade Station yesterday evening. After reading the most painful case as said in the article, he is disgusted by it. To him, she seems crude and degraded for having drunk and died in such a shameful manner. Mr. Duffy goes out to the pub because of the memory of her hand touching him. While he is drinking, he struggles with the two images he has of her as of right now; the lonely drunkard and the intelligent woman he was close to. He realizes that she has died, and has become a memory. He wonders if he could have done something for her. The previous sentence indicates that Mr. Duffy realizes that their relationship was “love.” But he never realizes it until it was too late. Now, he thinks of her lonely life and his at the same time. He knows that his lonely life will continue in the same pattern until he dies. As he walks even though it is extremely cold, he feels that Mrs. Sinico is almost there with him; it seems that he could even hear her voice, since his memory of her is so strong. He looks down at the wall of the park and he sees lovers lying. “He felt that he had been outcast from life’s feast.” (29) This means that he is an outcast from human life. The lovers are aware that he is there and it seems like they want him to leave. 

“One human being had seemed to love him and he had denied her life and happiness: he had sentenced her to the death of shame.” This statement is totally true, that when Mrs. Sinico shows interest by showing unusual excitement, Mr. Duffy ignores her emotions. Perhaps, Mr. Duffy’s cold-headedness leads her to be heart-broken, and the reason why they end their intercourse. Mrs. Sinico thought she was very close to him that she opened up to him, while Mr. Duffy only thought her as a friend. Mrs. Sinico desired for love and caring because she is a lonely person. She is married and had a child, but still they didn’t spend time with her, as a family. Mr. Duffy didn’t realize at that time, but once her presence leaves him, he realizes he is alone, that he has been alone for his entire life and he will always be alone, until the day he dies. This story is A Painful Case, written by James Joyce, which shows “isolation” and loneliness of the two characters Mr. Duffy and Mrs. Sinico.

Anthropometry was first created by Alphonse Bertillon (April 24, 1853 – February 13, 1914). He was born in Paris, France and when he became a police officer, he created Anthropometry so that criminals could be easily identified. The system helped the police to get through various criminal records quicker and having produced a set of characters of criminals, it became easier for them to identify offenders.

The system involves 10 measurements:

Eyelid

An eyelid is a thin piece of skin that covers and protects the eye. It is one of the thinnest areas of skin on a persons body. A muscle pulls back the eyelid to "open" the eye. People do this willingly or without thinking. The human eyelid has a row of eyelashes that help protect the eye from dust and other small objects. Eyelashes also keep sweat out of the eye. Eyelids regularly spread tears and other secretions on the surface of the eye to keep it moist. The cornea is one part of the eye that must be kept moist. Eyelids keep the eyes from drying out when asleep. Also, the blink reflex protects the eye from things touching it.

Dalit

Dalit (from Sanskrit ‘dal’ which means to split, to crack, to break) is the name given to a group of people who have been historically considered outcasts in societies from South Asia (India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan) and Eastern Africa (Somalia). Today, the Dalits, former known as “Untouchables”, have increasingly adopted the term “Dalit” as their way out of the social segregation imposed by the caste system.

Untouchability, is an ancient form of discrimination based upon caste. It is not merely the inability to touch a human being but also an attitude towards a minority group translated into various physical acts, norms and practices.

The Dalit status carries with it the stigma of “untouchability” because it is associated with menial, degrading tasks immediately connected with their traditional occupations which include unclogging sewers, disposing of dead bodies and cleaning latrines.

The discrimination against the Dalits takes various forms such as:

The rate of literacy among the Dalits, as per 1991 census, was 37.41% as compared to 57.69% for non-Dalits.
Untouchability in schools has contributed to drop-out and illiteracy levels for Dalit children. The 1991 census of India reported that Dalit communities were one of the least literate social groups in the country, with only 30% of Dalit children recognized to have basic reading and writing skills.

Half of India's Dalit children are undernourished, 21% are 'severely underweight', and 12% die before their 5th birthday. Between 1998-1999 at least 50% of Dalit women suffered from anemia. High morbidity and child mortality are firmly linked to their low quality of life imposed by poverty, educational status and discrimination.

There have been many attempts to neutralize the caste-based discrimination. In the 1930s, the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi began to change attitudes towards the Dalit minority. In 1949 ‘Untouchability’ was outlawed by the Indian constitution and Indian law does not permit the practice of a caste system. Discrimination against the Dalit minority has become an important human rights and political issue. Even so, in rural areas the Dalits are still facing the consequences of the slow and steady decline of discrimination. 

Today, the Dalit movements (The Dalit Panther Movement, the Dalit Mahasabha and the Dalit Sangharsh Samithi) which have emerged during the 20th century continue to struggle for equality. The progress of the past few decades shows hope for an improved level of equality within Indian society. In 1997, Kocheril Raman Narayanan, became the
first Dalit to have been elected President on India. Another important political figure was Mayawati Kumari, the leader of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) which represents the Dalits. She has been elected four times as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state.

The National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights (NCDHR) established in 1998 by Dalit human rights activists, is one of many organisations committed to the elimination of caste discrimination. It's main objectives are "“to hold the State accountable for all Human Rights violations committed against Dalits; to sensitize civil society by raising visibility of the Dalit problem; and to render justice to Dalit victims of discrimination and violence.”"
The International Dalit Solidarity Network, which was established in 2000, is another organisation concerned about caste discrimination and similar forms of discrimination based on work and descent. It has emerged as a network of national solidarity groups from affected countries such as those in South Asia and even West Africa.

Mesosaurus

Mesosaurus is an extinct marine reptile from the early Permian of southern Africa and South America. It was one of the first known marine reptiles, and had many adaptations to a fully aquatic lifestyle. It is usually considered to have been anapsid, although Friedrich von Huene considered that it was synapsid, and this hypothesis has been revived recently.

"Mesosaurus" was one of the first reptiles to return to the water after early tetrapods came to land in the later Devonian. It was around in length, with webbed feet, a streamlined body, and a long tail that may have supported a fin. It probably propelled itself through the water with its long hind legs and flexible tail. Its body was also flexible and could easily move sideways, but it had heavily thickened ribs, which would have prevented it from twisting its body.

"Mesosaurus" had a small skull with long jaws. The nostrils were located at the top, allowing the creature to breathe with only the upper side of its head breaking the surface. Its teeth were suitable for catching small nektonic prey such as crustaceans.

"Mesosaurus" was significant in providing evidence for the theory of continental drift, because its remains were found in southern Africa and eastern South America, two far away places. As "Mesosaurus" was a coastal animal, and therefore could not have crossed the Atlantic Ocean, this distribution indicated that the two continents used to be joined together.

Bokbunja ju (hangul: 복분자주; hanja: 覆盆子酒; also spelled bokbunjaju, bokbunja-ju, or bokbunjajoo, and also called bokbunja wine) is a Korean traditional wine made from fermented Korean black raspberries called bokbunja (hangul: 복분자; hanja: 覆盆子; Rubus coreanus). The main ingredient, bokbunja, is harvested at the early June. After getting rid of impurities, brewers of Bokbunja ju have the harvested bokbunja ferment with some sugar for a week. Adding alcohol to the fermented bokbunja, they have it ripen and it becomes bokbunja ju.
Bokbunja ju is crimson in color and sweet. It has between 14% and 16% alcohol. Especially, Korean men enjoy drinking it in a sense that it is believed to be very good for male sexual stamina. In that sense, there has been a saying that “after drinking bokbunja ju, men can throw a chamber pot with their urine.”

Hangwa

A hangwa is a Korean traditional cookie. Hangwa includes Yumilgwa Yugwa, Dasik Dasik and Yeot Gangjeong. Hangwa is also called "Jogwa" since it is made of diverse grains and looks like fruits. 

Hangwa was very popular among people over the Shilla and Goryeo because the yield of grains had went up a lot and people tried not to eat meat for religious reasons. The religion at that time was Buddhism. Since then, Hangwa has become necessary in wedding ceremonies, memorial sacrifice days, and social dinners.

The basic materials of Hangwa are mostly natural and based on the materials Hangwa is primarily divided into seven kinds and the recipes are slightly different.

Hangwa does not go bad easily because it is very good at preservation. This comes from the fermentation of grains and use of honey. Also, Hangwa is very nutritious. Ancestors thought that food was natural medicine and the idea was reflected on the nutrition of Hangwa too. Also, Hangwa shows Korean traditional virtue and emotions. It represents the warmth of neighbors. In ancient times, when people had ceremonies or social meetings, they made their guest go back with some food, which was mostly Tteok and Hangwa. In other words, Hangwa talks about the kindness and the affection between people in Korea.

The Verdin ("Auriparus flaviceps") is a small bird. It is the only species in the genus "Auriparus", and the only species in the family found in the New World.

The Verdin is a very small bird. At 4.5 inches in length, it rivals the Bushtit as one of the smallest passerines in North America. It is gray overall, and adults have a bright yellow head and rusty "shoulder patch" (the lesser coverts). Unlike the tits, it has a sharply pointed bill.

Verdins are insectivores. They keep looking among the desert trees and scrubs. They usually live alone except when they pair up to make their nests. They are very friendly birds. Verdins occasionally try to get tidbits of dried sugar water from hummingbird feeders.

Verdins always have and will live in southwestern United States and northern Mexico, ranging from southeastern California to Texas, throughout Baja California and into central Mexico, north of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.

Sikhae

Sikhae is a salted fermented food with grains in Korean cuisine as one of jeotgal. "Sikhae" is made with various fish, such as flat fish, shellfish, pollack, squid and fish intestines, and cooked grains, such as rice, glutinous rice, glutinous foxtail millet and nonglutinous millet. "Sikhae" is less salty than jeotgal because most jeotgal is made with seafood and salt, but "sikhae" is made with not only the ingredients of jeotgal but also grains, shredded radish, etc. Therefore, "sikhae" is stored for short-term, while jeotgal is able to be stored for rather long-term because of the large amount of salt. 

The types of "sikhae" can be different, depending on the main ingredients, regions, what the family and the person like. In past times, because of the limited transportation, regions near the sea had more types of "sikhae" compared to the inland areas. Koreans usually eat this food as a banchan(small dishes of food).

"Sikhae" was not included in any literature before the early part of the Korean Joseon Dynasty. However, that doesn't mean there was not "sikhae" and rather it guesses that "sikhae" was not written down. After the middle of Joseon Dynasty, "sikhae" have been mentioned in literature.

Sikhae is made with fish, salt, cooked rice, Korean traditional spices, etc. First, wash fishes and put drained fishes with salt in a pot. After about 10 days, take the salted fishes out of the pot, cut them into bite-size pieces and then put them with cooked rice and chili powder in the pot again. Lastly, put shredded radish into the pot after another four days and finally eat "sikhae" as 10 more days are passing.

- Gajamisikhae is the typical and popular Korean sikhae. It is made mostly in the region of North Korea. 

Sikhae has a lot of effects. First, sikhae, as one of fermented food, is easily digested by creating peptone, peptide, and free amino acid through the process of decomposition of protein and so good nourishing food for patients, the old and the infirm and children. Also, millet, one of ingredients of Sikhae, helps people warm body in the winter when people have cold hands or feet due to the very cold weather.

Diapsid

A diapsid is a reptile with two fenestrae (holes) behind the eye on each side of its skull. Most reptiles are diapsids, and the condition does not occur in mammals. The function of the holes is to improve jaw movements, and to reduce the weight of the skull. The holes give places for muscle attachment; also, as jaw muscles contract, the holes allow space for the muscles to bulge.

The "Allosaurus" skull shows the way the skull became lighter in dinosaurs, especially the large theropods. It is here not much more than a series of struts, yet provides massive bite power.

Some aquatic reptile groups lost the lower of the two openings, leaving just one behind the eye. This is called the euryapsid condition. It is fairly certain that this is secondary, and that the groups were originally diapsids. The groups include:

World War One guns were very new and powerful. The machine gun was new and killed many people. It took four to six people to work one. They fired 400 to 600 bullets per minute. The machine guns got too hot and needed water on them. The first machine gun was made in 1884 by Hiram Maxim. It was not used in battle until 1914.

The German machine gun was the MG08 and the British used the Vickers Machine Gun. The Vickers Machine Gun was very safe and easy to use. The normal British army gun was the Lee Enfield 0.303 rifle. This was made in 1907 by James Lee. The Lee Enfield could fire twelve bullets per minute. The Germans used the Mauser rifle made in 1898 by Paul Mauser. This was an excellent rifle, but only held five bullets.

The machine guns changed how war went; and killed many soldiers. Because they sometimes got too hot, they could be slow. The normal army guns shot straight and were very safe.

Suncheon

Suncheon is a city of Korea. It belongs to Jeollanam-do. 70% of Suncheon is composed of mountains and the city has the greatest amount of mountains in the province. An average temperature for the year of the city is 12.5℃ and the average temperature for January is -0.5℃ and that for August is 25.2℃. Since Suncheon fronts the southern sea, the city is relatively warm during the winter by the effect of oceanic climate.

Suncheon is famous among Korea travelers due to its beautiful tourist attractions and local food of great taste. Among many spots, Suncheon bay is the most well-known. It was selected as one of the top 5 coastal wetlands in the world. The large mud flat stretches out and several kinds of birds and other living creatures live there. Also, the wide field of reeds along the waterside forms magnificent view. The Suncheon bay reeds festival is held every October and it gets great reputation.

Since the city is located nearby sea, dishes made of diverse fresh fish highly attract those who visit Suncheon. Especially, thanks to the well-protected ecological environment, mudskippers which exist usually in the very clean mud flat are seen in the Suncheon bay. They are used for cooking in Suncheon and the dish is very famous for its greater taste than any other region in the country.

Medicine in World War 1

Medicine got better during World War I. Soldiers got hurt during battles, fights in war. Sometimes, the soldiers had “shell shock,” a kind of confusion. The people in charge yelled at the soldiers. The confused soldiers had to sit alone. By 1917, doctors were nicer to the confused men. The doctors knew more about “shell shock.” The doctors could talk to the confused soldiers.

Dean Edwards

Dean Edwards (born July 30, 1970, The Bronx, New York City) is an American actor and comedian. Edwards joined the cast of "Saturday Night Live" in 2001. He created several impressions. These include Michael Jackson, Wayne Brady, Chris Tucker, Don Cheadle, Colin Powell, Serena Williams, Nipsey Russell, Denzel Washington, Grace Jones, and Billy Ocean. Chris Tucker was Edwards' first impression. This was also the an impression done by Jay Pharoah on his first "SNL" episode on September 25, 2010. Even though Edwards was very good at impressions, he was not used much during his time working on the program. He left after the program's 28th season. He said it was because of creative differences. He also appeared in "Tony N' Tina's Wedding", "The Sopranos", "Robotomy", and "Scared Shrekless". In "Scared Shrekless" and "Thriller Night", he voiced the part of Donkey.

Many feel that Edwards voice and style is very similar to that of Eddie Murphy. 
On YouTube, Edwards currently has his own channel known as "deanedwardscomedy".

Fermilab

Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), located just outside Batavia, Illinois, near Chicago, is a US Department of Energy national laboratory specializing in high-energy particle physics. As of January 1, 2007, Fermilab is operated by the Fermi Research Alliance, a joint venture of the University of Chicago, Illinois Institute of Technology and the Universities Research Association (URA). Fermilab is a part of the Illinois Technology and Research Corridor. 

Fermilab's Tevatron was a landmark particle accelerator; at in circumference, it was the world's second largest energy particle accelerator (CERN's Large Hadron Collider is 27 km in circumference), until being shut down on September 30, 2011. In 1995, two teams at Fermilab (CDF and DØ, detectors which utilize the Tevatron) announced the discovery of the top quark.

In addition to high energy collider physics, Fermilab is also host to a number of smaller fixed-target and neutrino experiments, such as MiniBooNE (Mini Booster Neutrino Experiment), SciBooNE (SciBar Booster Neutrino Experiment) and MINOS (Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search). The MiniBooNE detector is a diameter sphere which contains 800 tons of mineral oil lined with 1520 individual phototube detectors. An estimated 1 million neutrino events are recorded each year. SciBooNE is the newest neutrino experiment at Fermilab; it sits in the same neutrino beam as MiniBooNE but has fine-grained tracking capabilities. The MINOS experiment uses Fermilab's NuMI (Neutrinos at the Main Injector) beam, which is an intense beam of neutrinos that travels through the Earth to the Soudan Mine in Minnesota.

A large piece of land was reserved for Fermilab, but much of the equipment is underground. The Fermilab scientists decided to use the land surface as an experiment in restoring Illinois original prairie. They also started a farm to raise al herd of American bison. The Fermilab Nature Areas is a separate non-profit group that administers these programs.

Asteroid 11998 Fermilab is named in honor of the laboratory.

Between World War II and the 1960s, the federal government funded different particle accelerators at competing universities to build high-energy physics experiments. Most notable were the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC), which sent particles in a straight line, the Brookhaven National Laboratory at SUNY Stoney Brook and the Cornell University synchrotron, which sent particles around in a circle to have the same magnets work on the particles many times. By the 1960s, the cost of building bigger atom smashers were too high to fund each individual campus, and the size of ring for the next circular accelerator would be too large to fit on an existing college campus. So, the federal government decided to start a new location to be run by physicists from several universities. They held a competition to pick a site, but politicians fought for it to be in Illinois.

Weston, Illinois was a community next to Batavia. It was a subdivision of pre-fabricated homes started in the early 1960s. Sales were very slow, so the land developers tried to attract Fermilab to be a new employer on the edge of the new town. However, it turned out that the amount of land needed would swallow up the entire town. So, the town voted to sell all of the land, including the houses that had been built to Fermilab. The town then dissolved.

The laboratory was founded in 1967 as the National Accelerator Laboratory; it was renamed in honor of Enrico Fermi in 1974. The lab's first director was Robert Rathbun Wilson. Wilson made many of the sculptures on the campus. He is attributed as being responsible for it being finished ahead of time and under budget. The high rise laboratory building located on the site, the unique shape of which has become the symbol for Fermilab, is named in his honor, and is the center of activity on the campus.

Before the new buildings could be finished, the scientists moved into the Weston houses and also moved all of the farm houses on Fermilab to that location for use as office space. They renamed Weston, "Fermilab Village." It still houses visiting scientists.

Wilson brought in the team that had built the Cornell synchrotron to help build the orginal 200 GeV accelerator. Two important inventions made this accelerator obsolete: superconducting magnets and using the same acclerator ring to send two groups of particles around in opposite directions so that when the collide they would have twice the energy.

After Wilson stepped down in 1978 to protest the lack of funding for the lab, Leon M. Lederman took on the job. It was under his guidance that the original accelerator was replaced with the Tevatron accelerator. The new accelerator was capable of colliding proton and an antiproton at a combined energy of 1.96 TeV. Lederman stepped down in 1988 and remains Director Emeritus. The on-site science education center (which serves students and the general public) was named in his honor.

From 1988 to 1998, the lab was run by John Peoples. From that time until June 30, 2005, the lab was run by Michael S. Witherell. On November 19, 2004 Piermaria Oddone, formerly of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, was announced as Fermilab's newest director. Oddone began his term as director July 1, 2005.

Fermilab continues to participate in the work in the LHC including serving as a Tier 1 site in the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid. The State of Illinois is funding a new Illinois Accelerator Research Center building at Fermilab for scientists and industrial partners.

The first stage in the acceleration process takes place in the Cockcroft–Walton generator. It involves taking hydrogen gas and turning it into H ions by introducing it into a container lined with molybdenum electrodes: a matchbox-sized, oval-shaped cathode and a surrounding anode, separated by 1 mm and held in place by glass ceramic insulators. A magnetron is used to generate a plasma to form H near the metal surface. A 750 keV electrostatic field is applied by the Cockcroft–Walton generator, and the ions are accelerated out of the container. The next step is the linear accelerator (or linac), which accelerates the particles to 400 MeV, or about 70% of the speed of light. Right before entering the next accelerator, the H ions pass through a carbon foil, becoming H ions (protons).

The next step is the booster ring. The booster ring is a 468 m circumference circular accelerator that uses magnets to bend beams of protons in a circular path. The protons coming from the Linac travel around the Booster about 20,000 times in 33 milliseconds so that they repeatedly experience electric fields. With each revolution the protons pick up more energy, leaving the Booster with 8 GeV. The Main Injector is the next link in the accelerator chain. Completed in 1999, it has become Fermilab's "particle switchyard" with three functions: it accelerates protons, it delivers protons for antiproton production, and it accelerates antiprotons coming from the antiproton source. The final accelerator was the Tevatron. It was the second most powerful particle accelerator in the world (CERN's Large Hadron Collider being the most powerful). Traveling at almost the speed of light, protons and antiprotons circle the Tevatron in opposite directions. Physicists coordinate the beams so that they collide at the centers of two 5,000-ton detectors DØ and CDF inside the Tevatron tunnel at energies of 1.96 TeV, revealing the conditions of matter in the early universe and its structure at the smallest scale. The Tevatron is being converted into a museum.

The linear accelerator also has a medical treatment facility. Doctors treat people with cancer by shooting protons or neutrons from the accelerator into their tumors.

Heterojunction bipolar transistor

The heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) is a type of bipolar junction transistor (BJT) which uses different semiconductor materials for the emitter and base regions, making a heterojunction. The HBT is better than the BJT because HBT can handle signals of very high frequencies, up to several hundred GHz. HBT is commonly used in modern ultrafast circuits, mostly radio-frequency (RF) systems, and in applications requiring a high power efficiency, such as RF power amplifiers in cellular phones. The idea of using a heterojunction is as old as the conventional BJT, dating back to a patent from 1951.

The principal difference between the BJT and HBT is in the use of different semiconductor materials for the emitter and base regions, making a heterojunction. This limits the injection of holes from the base into the emitter region, since the potential barrier in the valence band is higher than in the conduction band. Unlike BJT technology, this allows a high doping density to be used in the base. The high doping density reduces the base resistance while maintaining gain. The efficiency of the heterojunction is measured by the Kroemer factor.

Wet chemistry

Wet chemistry studies chemical reactions that occur in the liquid phase. It is also called bench chemistry because many of the tests performed are done at a lab bench.

Wet chemistry uses laboratory glassware, such as beakers and flasks, without quantitative chemical analysis using instrumentation. Many high school and college laboratories teach students basic wet chemistry methods.

Before the age of theoretical and computational chemistry, it was the main form of scientific discovery in the chemical field. So, some people call wet chemistry classic chemistry or classical chemistry. Today's society and quality control requirements need a high volume of wet chemistry. So, many wet chemistry methods have been automated and computerized for faster analysis.

Wet chemistry techniques can be used for qualitative chemical measurements, such as changes in color (colorimetry), but often involves more quantitative chemical measurements, using methods such as gravimetry and titrimetry. Some uses for wet chemistry include tests for:


Wet chemistry is also used in environmental chemistry settings and is used for to test:


It can also involve the elemental analysis of samples, e.g., water sources, for items like:

Korean Canadian

Korean Canadians are Canadians of Korean descent. According to South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, there are 223,322 Koreans or people of Korean ancestry in Canada. This is the fourth-largest population of Koreans outside of Korea (after Koreans in Japan and ahead of Koreans in Russia). Also, the government of South Korean guessed that there are more than 100,000 Koreans living in Canada illegally.

The first Koreans who came to Canada were Christians. They were sent by Canadian missionaries to study Christianity in Canada. Not many stayed in Canada though; and in 1965, the total Korean population of Canada was only about 70 people. However, after 1966's change of Canadian immigration laws, South Korean immigration to Canada grew. Between 1970 and 1980, 18,148 Koreans immigrated to Canada, and another 17,583 came in the 1990s. In the late 1990s, South Korea became the fifth-largest source of immigrants to Canada. Toronto has the most Koreans in Canada, but Vancouver has the highest growth rate of Koreans. They have increased 69% since 1996. Montreal has the third-most Korean immigrants at this time. In 2001, More Koreans went to Canada than to the United States. The number of temporary residents also grew after the Canadian government made visas not necessary; South Korea sent the most international students to Canada in the late 1990s. Many of the Koreans who came to Canada, came from the Korean population in China.

In the 1990s, many Koreans came to Canada because unemployment was high and income growth was low. It was the opposite in the United States at this time. They also came because the Canadian dollar was very weak, so they could get a lot of Canadian money from their Korean money. In the USA, they could get less American dollars. So they had more money if they came to Canada Lastly, in Korea at the time there was lots of anti-American feelings, and also many local native teachers came from Canada, so Koreans knew Canadians very well. .

Many Koreans in Canada are well educated, and many new immigrants and their children are skilled workers such as—doctors, professors, engineers, computer technicians—or businessmen.

Korean Canadians are usually one of three types: first generation immigrants, the “1.5” generation who began their schooling in Korea but moved to Canada in their childhood or teen years, and the second generation born in Canada. Each group is very unique, but Korean Canadians are very loyal to their Korean culture. They do this by local culture activities, university and alumni groups, seniors’ groups, language schools and business contacts. Vancouver and Toronto have Korean-language newspapers, and Korean television and radio programs. Korean dance, music art, as well as martial arts and Korean cuisine, are very popular in Canada.

Today, many Korean Canadians are Christians, and often attend Korean churches. A small number are Buddhist or are not religious. 

Statistics were researched in 2007 by the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The statistics showed that among Koreans living in Canada, 86,084 are Canadian citizens, 72,077 are permanent residents, 20,738 people have student visas, and 19,271 other people are temporary residents. The Canada 2001 Census said that there are 101,715 Canadians of Korean descent, but Korean community leaders and the media think that there are more than this. A big group could be temporary students studying English. According to the Canada 1996 Census, 53.6% of Korean immigrants to Canada graduated from University, compared to 23% of other Canadians. However, because Canadian employers prefer degrees from Canada, Korean immigrants often do jobs that are not what they studied in Korea; 40% worked in family-owned businesses, and their average income is only 67% of other Canadian's income.

Placodont

Placodonts were a group of Triassic marine reptiles which had heavy flat teeth. These teeth were used for crushing shellfish. Placodonts are in the Order Sauropterygia, the group that includes Plesiosaurs. Placodonts were mostly between in length, up to a maximum long. They are found in marine sediments of the Middle and Upper Triassic, 235–250 million years ago.

The first specimen was discovered in 1830, and they have since been discovered throughout central Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and China.

The earliest forms like "Placodus", which lived in the early to middle Triassic, looked rather barrel-shaped. Later placodonts had bony plates on their backs which protected their bodies while feeding.

By the Upper Triassic, these plates had grown so much that placodonts of the time such as "Henodus" and "Placochelys" looked like the sea turtles of modern day more than their ancestors. Other placodonts like "Psephoderma" developed plates as well, but in a different articulated manner that resembled the shells of horseshoe crabs and trilobites more than those of sea turtles. All these adaptations are examples of convergent evolution, as placodonts were not related to any of these animals. 

Because of their dense bone and heavy armour plating, these creatures would have been too heavy to float in the ocean and would have used a lot of energy to reach the water surface. For this reason, and because of the type of sediment found with the fossils, it is suggested placodonts lived in shallow waters and not in deep oceans.

The placodonts ate shellfish. Their front teeth stuck out: they would be used to dig up the shellfish, and pull them from any attachment to the substrate. Inside their mouth, the teeth were large and flat: they were used to crush the shells.

Their diet consisted of marine bivalves, brachiopods, and other invertebrates.
