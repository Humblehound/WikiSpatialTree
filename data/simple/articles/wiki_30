Jessie Redmon Fauset

Jessie Redmon Fauset (April 27, 1882 – April 30, 1961) was an American editor, poet, essayist and novelist. She wrote more books than any other African-American female novelist of the Harlem Renaissance.

Fauset was born in Fredericksville, New Jersey, in Camden County. She was the daughter of Anna Seamon and Redmon Fauset, a Presbyterian minister. Her mother, Annie, died when she was still a little girl.

Fauset attended Philadelphia High School for girls. She was the only African-American student to graduate. After high school Fauset graduated from Cornell University in 1905. She was also the first African-American woman to be honoured by being made a member of the "Phi Beta Kappa" Society which encourages talented undergraduate students. In 1912, when she was only 16 years old she started work at the NAACP's journal, "The Crisis". The NAACP is the "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People", an organization that was begun in 1902 to help African-Americans, and is now one of the oldest civil rights organizations in America. From 1919 to 1926 Fauset was the literary editor of "The Crisis". She wrote 77 published works of which 58 were first published in the journal. 
She is the author of four novels," There Is Confusion " (1924), "Plum Bun" (1928), "The Chinaberry Tree: A Novel of American Life" (1931), and "Comedy, American Style" (1933). She was made an honorary member of the women's society for academics whose work has really helped other people, "Delta Sigma Theta".

Fauset worked as a school teacher for many years. She stopped teaching in 1944. She died in 1961 from heart failure.



Kevin De Ornellas has written five articles about Fauset in "Writing African American Women: An Encyclopedia of Literature by and about Women of Color" (Greenwood Press, 2006), edited by Elizabeth Ann Beaulieu. One article is a biography; the other four pieces analyze her four novels.)

Ruins

Ruins are the parts of buildings that are left after they have been destroyed and cannot be properly used any more. Many ruins are ancient and famous like the ruins of the forum of Ancient Rome, or the ruins of Tintagel Castle on the coast of Cornwall. Ruins can be caused by wars or by natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires and volcanos. Sometimes people leave a house or a village to stand empty, and move somewhere else. When this happens, the house or village slowly becomes a ruin. 

Historic ruins are often a good place for archaeologists to search for evidence of the way people used to live. Often the ruins have all sorts of interesting things buried in them. Archaeologists call the things that they find "artefacts". Artefacts might include beautiful artworks, jewellry and gold coins but usually they are ordinary things like cooking pots, mugs, spoons, hair combs, pipes, old shoes, broken toys and rats' nests. Historians use the evidence found by the archaeologists to write about the place and what might have happened there. 

Other people who find ruins very interesting are artists. Many artists have drawn or painted pictures of ruined buildings. In the 18th and 19th centuries, pictures of ruins became very popular.

617 Patroclus

617 Patroclus "(pə-troe'-kləs," ) is a binary minor planet made up of two similarly-sized objects orbiting their common centre of gravity. It is a Trojan, sharing an orbit with Jupiter. It was found in 1907 by August Kopff, and was the second Trojan asteroid to be found. Recent evidence suggests that the objects are icy comets, rather than rocky asteroids.

Patroclus orbits in Jupiter's trailing Lagrangian point, L, in an orbit called the 'Trojan node' after one of the sides in the legendary Trojan War (the other node is called the 'Greek node'). Patroclus is the only object in the Trojan camp to be named after a Greek character; the naming rules for the Trojan asteroids were not made until after Patroclus was named (similarly, the asteroid Hektor is the only Trojan character to appear in the Greek camp).

In 2001, it was found that Patroclus is a binary object, made up of two asteroids which are almost the same size. In February, 2006, a team of astronomers led by Franck Marchis measured accurately the orbit of the system using the Keck Laser guide star adaptive optics system. They thought that the two asteroids orbit around their center of mass in 4.283±0.004 d at a distance of 680±20 km, describing a close to circular orbit. Putting together their sightings with thermal measurements taken in November 2000, the team thought what the size of the asteroids of the system could be. The slightly bigger asteroids, which measures 122 km in diameter, continues to have the name Patroclus. The smaller asteroid, measuring 112 km, is now named Menoetius (full name (617) Patroclus I Menoetius), after the legendary Patroclus's father. Its provisional designation was S/2001 (617) 1.

Because of the density of the asteroids (0.8 g/cm³) is less than water and about one third that of rock, the team of researchers led by F. Marchis suggest that the Patroclus system, previously thought to be a pair of rocky asteroids, is more similar to a comet in make up. It is thought that many Trojan asteroids are in fact small planetesimals captured in the Lagrange point of Jupiter-Sun system during the farther migration of the giant planets, 3.9 billion years ago. This scenario was suggested by A. Morbidelli and colleagues in a series of articles published in May 2005 in "Nature" journal.

Aue-Schwarzenberg is a rural district in the Free State of Saxony, in the country of Germany.

The districts of Aue and Schwarzenberg were formed in 1873. In 1994 both districts were joined together in order to form a new district, which was called "Westerzgebirgskreis" (the Western Ore Mountains District). It was renamed Aue-Schwarzenberg in 1995.

The district is located in the western part of the Erzgebirge (ore) Mountains. The tops of these mountains are also the German-Czech border. The highest peak in the district is the Auersberg , second highest mountain in Saxony.

Delitzsch Rural District

Delitzsch is a former rural district in the Free State of Saxony, Germany.

After the Congress of Vienna in 1815 Saxony had to give a lot of its land to Prussia, including the region of Delitzsch. The Prussian government made the district of Delitzsch.

Prussia was dissolved after the end of the Nazi era. Delitzsch was made a part of the new state of Saxony-Anhalt. In 1953 the East German government dissolved the states. After the German reunification in 1990, the states were made again, but now Delitzsch and Eilenburg (two districts made of the former Delitzsch district) were given to Saxony instead of Saxony-Anhalt. The two districts were joined in 1994 and gave the district in its present borders. In 2008 Delitzsch Rural district was merged with Torgau-Oschatz Rural District to Nordsachsen Rural District. 

The district is in the triangle between the big cities of Leipzig, Halle and Bitterfeld. It is mostly countryside, and used for farming. The Mulde River runs through the east part of the district. On the eastern banks there is the Düben Heath ("Dübener Heide") nature park.

Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street

Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a Tony Award-winning musical with a book by Hugh Wheeler and music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. The musical is based on the 19th century legend of Sweeney Todd and is similar to the 1973 play "The String of Pearls", by Christopher Bond. 

"Sweeney Todd" opened on Broadway at the Uris Theatre on March 1, 1979. It was directed by Harold Prince with musical staging by Larry Fuller, and starred Len Cariou as Sweeney Todd and Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Lovett. The musical played 557 times. 


The story is about Sweeney Todd, who was first named Benjamin Barker. Todd comes back from the prison camps in Australia, where he was for fifteen years. Then he learns from the pie-maker Mrs. Lovett that his wife poisoned herself after being raped by Judge Turpin. He also finds out that the Judge is keeping his daughter. Todd decides to take revenge. Sweeney and Mrs Lovett become partners in a plan that ends in murder, business for Lovett's pie shop, and a lot of sadness.

The Maccabees

The Maccabees are a English indie band based in Brighton. They first came from south London.

The band thought of the name 'The Maccabees' by opening the Bible to a random page.. Even though the name has religious meaning, lead singer Orlando Weeks said that none of the band are religious in an interview on Steve Lamacq's BBC Radio 1 show. 

The Maccabees' debut single, 'X-Ray', was released on the Promise record label on 28 November 2005. It was played a little in the evenings on London radio station Xfm London. The band got very attentiong until six months later, when they released their second single, 'Latchmere'. The song was about the wave machine at the band's local Latchmere Leisure Centre in Battersea, south London. It was released on Fierce Panda Records in April 2006. This song was talked about by Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacqu and was played on MTV2. The video, directed by Hugh Frost and Samuel Bebbington, also became a hit after it was put on YouTube. 

In mid-2006, the music magazine NME wrote favourable things about the band, such as a review of their show at Cafe dé Paris in London. The magazine called the band "the best new band in Britain".

In November 2006 the band toured, or traveled and played, with Fields, ¡Forward, Russia!, and Wolfmother as part of the MTV Two "Brand Spanking New Music" tour. Drummer Robert Dylan Thomas broke his wrist just before the band were due to begin touring, and was replaced by drummer Elliott Andrews. Elliot toured with the band until early 2007, and now plays drums for Kate Nash.

The band are currently signed to Fiction Records, and released their debut album 'Colour It In' in May 2007. Because the album had been leaked, or accidentally put, on the internet, 'Colour It In' became available to download exclusively from iTunes on 17 April before its release on 14 May. The song First Love was the Maccabees' first to chart in the UK top 40. It was followed by 'About Your Dress', which charted at #33. Their next album was released to positive reviews, and charted at #24. They toured the USA with fellow Indie group Bloc Party. A UK tour happened in October 2007, ending in a show at the Roundhouse venue in London, where all the tickets were sold.

During late 2007, Samsung used the song Toothpaste Kisses in advertising for its SGH-G800 mobile phone. 

The band is currently writing music for another album.


The band worked together to write the lyrics.
Orlando makes the band's artwork. Guitarist Felix White was once in a band called 'Jack's Basement'with close friend and current solo artist Jack Peñate, but he is not anymore. Felix and Hugo White are brothers, along with Will White, who is the lead singer and guitarist with another band, Talk Taxis.

Clinic

A clinic is a medical facility that gives health care for patients in an area. It is different from a hospital, because people do not stay in a clinic for a long time. Some clinics can become as large as hospitals, but still have the name Clinic. Small clinics are run by one or more general practitioners or practice managers. Physiotherapy clinics are run by physiotherapists, psychology clinics run by clinical psychologists, and so on for each type of health care. Some clinics are operated, or run, by employers. Other clinics are owned by people who do not have medical education, like in China. 

Some clinics are a place for people with injuries or illness to come and be seen by triage nurse or other health worker. In these clinics, the injury or illness may not be large or dangerous enough to warrant a visit to an emergency room, but the person can be moved to one if they need to be. These clinics sometimes can use equipment such as X-ray machines. Doctors at these clinics can send patients to specialists, a doctor who is very good at one kind of medicine.

The word "clinic" comes from the Greek word "klinein", which means to put something at an angle, or to lie down. Latin has the word "clinicus", which is a lot like the word we use today. An early meaning of the word clinic was, 'one who gets baptism on a sick bed'.

<doc id="92041" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92041" title="Fra Angelico">
Fra Angelico

Fra Angelico (c. 1385 February 18, 1455), was an Italian Early Renaissance painter. Giorgio Vasari, who wrote the "Lives of the Artists" said he had ""a rare and perfect talent"".

Fra Angelico has been known by many different names. When he was born, he was called Guido di Pietro. People who knew him when he was older called him Fra Giovanni da Fiesole (Brother John from Fiesole). When Giorgio Vasari wrote about him in "Lives of the Artists", in the 1500s, he was already known as Fra Giovanni Angelico (Brother Giovanni who is like an Angel).

The Italians usually call him il Beato Angelico (the Blessed Angelico). He has been called this for a long time, because he was thought to be blessed by God who gave him the talent of painting, and also because he was such a good and holy man. The name "Blessed Angelico" has now been made official, because in 1982 Pope John Paul II "conferred beatification" which means that he is now on the way to being made a saint.

Vasari says about him: ""It is impossible to think of enough good things to say about this holy father, who was so humble and modest in everything that he did and said, and whose pictures were painted with such cleverness and holy faith.""

Fra Angelico was born in Mugello near Fiesole in Tuscany, Italy probably about 1385–87 and died in Rome in 1455. Nothing is known about his parents. He was baptized Guido or Guidolino.

In 1407, he joined the Dominican Order at Fiesole. In 1423, when he became officially a friar, he changed his name from Guido to Fra Giovanni (Brother John). (People who are accepted into a holy order, usually take a new name.) Like the other "brothers" (friars) of the Dominican Order, he wore a white robe and a black cloak, and shaved part of his head. 

Fra Angelico had a brother called Benedetto who was also a Dominican friar. Fra Benedetto painted illuminated manuscripts. Fra Angelico possibly learnt to paint manuscripts as well. The convent of San Marco in Florence has several manuscript books that he is thought to have painted. He was very busy with other work at the convents where he lived, but he still found time to paint pictures, which very soon became famous. In January and February of 1418, he was paid for paintings that he did in the church of Santo Stefano del Ponte.

Between 1418 and 1436, Fra Angelico painted an altarpiece for the church in Fiesole, which has been damaged. Age caused the some of the paint to come off, or fade, and other artists have painted over some of Fra Angelico's work while trying to repair the paintings. The top part of the altarpiece is in the National Gallery, London. It shows Christ in Glory, surrounded by more than 250 figures, and is a large and magnificent piece of work. It has been described as one of the best works in the gallery.

In 1436, a new Dominican Convent of San Marco was established in Florence in some older monastery buildings. Fra Angelico was one of the friars from Fiesole who moved to Florence. This was an important move for Fra Angelico because Florence already had a great number of artists from whom he could learn. The convent had a very wealthy "patron of the arts" called Cosimo de' Medici who loved to buy works of art for himself and his favourite churches. Cosimo took the largest of the friars' rooms, called cells, at the convent so that he could have a quiet place for religious thought. Fra Angelico painted a picture showing the Magi at Bethlehem on the wall of Cosimo's cell.

Cosimo employed Fra Angelico to paint more pictures for the convent. All the cells for the friars were built upstairs around the sides of a square courtyard with a garden in the middle (called a cloister). On the wall at the top of the stairs, Fra Angelico painted a fresco of the Angel Gabriel announcing the birth of Jesus to the Blessed Virgin Mary. This is one of his most famous pictures. Fra Angelico then began to paint a picture in each of the monk's cells. Each cell has large picture with a round top on the wall beside the window. At least six of these paintings were done be by Fra Angelico, and others were done by artists who copied his style of painting. These pictures were to help the friars with their prayers. 

In 1439, he finished one of his most famous works, which is the altarpiece for San Marco's Church, which is where the friars worship. It shows the Madonna and Child on a throne, surrounded by saints from different dates, who are all grouped together as if they were standing in a room in Heaven, talking about holy things. This type of painting called a "Sacred Conversation" later became very popular, but this is one of the first ones.

In 1445, Pope Eugenius IV sent a message for Fra Angelico to come to Rome to paint the frescoes of the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament at St Peter's. The chapel was later demolished by Pope Paul III to make way for the new St.Peter's Basilica and Fra Angelico's work was lost. Vasari says that one of the popes (it might have been Eugenius or Pope Nichoas V) asked Fra Angelico if he would like the very important job of Archbishop of Florence. But Fra Angelico did not want such a high job and he suggested the name of another friar for the position. In 1447 Fra Angelico went to the city of Orvieto with his pupil, Benozzo Gozzoli, to paint some pictures for the Cathedral there . One of his other pupils was called Zanobi Strozzi, but he did not become as famous as Benozzo.

From 1447 to 1449, Fra Angelico was back at the Vatican, where Pope Nicholas V had built a small chapel where he could pray privately. The pictures that Fra Angelico and his pupils painted there are the lives of two young saints St. Stephen and St. Lawrence, who were both "martyrs" (they were killed because of their Christian faith). The small chapel, with its bright colours and gold leaf decorations is like a jewel box. From 1449 until 1452, Fra Angelico was back at his old convent of Fiesole, where he was the Prior (the head man). Fra Angelico's pupils were probably left in Rome to finish the work on the chapel. 

In 1455, Fra Angelico went back to Rome, probably to look at the work in Pope Nicholas' Chapel. He died at the Dominican Convent and was buried in the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Pope John Paul II beatified Fra Angelico on October 3, 1982, making him "officially" known as the "Blessed Angelico". In 1984 the pope made him the patron of Catholic artists.

Fra Angelico never wanted to be important, and even though he was so talented he never put himself above other people. He thought his most important job was caring for others. He always prayed before he picked up his brushes to paint, and he never made any changes to his pictures later, because he believed that the Holy Spirit was guiding him. He painted a great number of scenes of the Crucifixion and he would always cry while he was painting them.

The words on his grave say:

Fra Angelico was working at a time when the style of painting was in a state of change. The changes had begun a hundred years before his time with the works of Giotto. Fra Angelico would have seen the famous pictures of the "Life of Saint Francis" that Giotto did for the church of Santa Croce in Florence. In Giotto's paintings the figures look more real and solid and lifelike than in the pictures of other painters of the 1300s. Giotto was also very good at painting the emotions on peoples faces and the actions that showed how they were feeling. His work was a big influence on every artist who saw it.

At the same time, rich patrons like Cosimo de Medici liked to show off their wealth. They often did this by ordering paintings that had lots of bright colour and real gold backgrounds. The red colour called "vermilion" was one of the most expensive. But the most expensive colour was a beautiful blue made by grinding up a semi-precious stone called Lapis lazuli. This type of painting is called "International Gothic". Some artists of Fra Angelico's day were expert at doing paintings that would make very rich people happy. But other painters, like Masaccio were followers of Giotto and painted in a very plain way.

Fra Angelico was able to paint in both ways. If the Pope or a rich family wanted an altarpiece or a fresco that had gold and expensive bright colours, then Fra Angelico could do it. But his most famous paintings have no gold and no bright colours. They are the simple gentle paintings of the life of Jesus that he did for the friars in their cells at San Marcos.

This gallery shows stories from the life of Jesus. The square paintings are in tempera. They are all parts of a big altarpiece and are about 25 cm wide. The "tondo" (round painting) is a small altarpiece about 1.4 metres wide. All the paintings with arched tops are frescos and were painted for the Dominican brothers.

Milwaukee Brewers

The Milwaukee Brewers are a Major League Baseball team in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They play in the Central Division of the National League.

The team first played in Seattle, Washington for one season before changing names and moving to Milwaukee. The Brewers played in the American League from 1969 to 1997 and they won the American League championship in 1982. They started playing in the National League in 1998.

The name of the stadium where they play baseball is Miller Park, which was built in 2001. (Before Miller Park was built, the team played in Milwaukee County Stadium.) The team is named "Brewers" because Milwaukee, the city where the team plays, is famous for making beer.

<doc id="92076" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92076" title="Giorgio Vasari">
Giorgio Vasari

Giorgio Vasari, (1511-1574), was an Italian painter, architect and writer. He is most famous for his book ""The Lives of the Great Architects, Painters and Sculptors of Italy"", which is usually known as ""Vasari's Lives"". Although some other writers had written about art, this book, which was published in 1550 makes Vasari the first art historian. 

Vasari was born in 1511 to a wealthy family in the city of Arezzo in Tuscany. When he was 13 he was sent to Florence to study at the workshops of the well-known artists Andrea del Sarto. Florence is so famous for the arts that students like Vasari have been going there to learn painting and sculpture, ever since Giotto in the 1200s. The two most famous artists in the world, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were both alive when Vasari was a boy and had both studied in Florence. Vasari had the good luck to meet Michelangelo, who was like a great hero to Vasari. 

Vasari learnt well, and became one of the favourite artists of the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family who ruled Florence at that time. He did all sorts of important jobs for them. One of the most important buildings in the city was the Palazzo Vecchio (the "Old Palace") which was really a Medieval fortress, where the town council had always met. Vasari got the job of decorating the walls of the enormous meeting room with painted frescos. 

Vasari was very good at directing important artistic jobs, but he was not really as good a painter as he was architect. One of his most important architectural jobs was to begin the building of the Uffizi (Offices) in Florence. These are two long buildings that face each other across a long narrow courtyard with one end opening on the town square, and the other end opening onto the Arno River. At the end where the river is, Vasari designed a beautiful "loggia" which is a sort of two-storey veranda that joins the two buildings. It makes the narrow courtyard and the view of the river look like a stage set where wonderful things might happen. The Uffizi is now one of the most famous art galleries in the world.

Vasari had another important job for the Medici family. Eleanor, the wife of Duke Cosimo I, had bought a house. It was by far the biggest house in the city, and was across the river from the Uffizi. The Medici family was not always popular. The previous duke, Alessandro, had been murdered. So to keep the family safe, they needed an escape route from the Palazzo Vecchio to the Pitti Palace on the other side of the river. Vasari was expected to design it. The escape route is named after its designer. It is called the "Vasari Corridor". 

The corridor begins at the Palazzo Vecchio and runs along the top floor of the Uffizi and across the loggia near the river, then it runs on top of arches along the street by the riverbank, above a nice covered walkway at street-level where nowadays people can buy souvenirs. The Vasari Corridor then gets to a bridge, the Ponte Vecchio. It is the oldest, most famous bridge in the city, and on both sides it had rows of shops and houses. But the Medici did not mind that! They just had anything that was in the way pulled down. When the Corridor gets to the other side of the river, it makes some twists and turns. Some buildings were knocked down to make way, but the Mannelli family who lived in a large tower were not so obliging and so the corridor is made to go around its walls. Eventually it gets to the Pitti Palace, which is an enormous building of brown stone, with big carved lions' heads beneath all the windows. Vasari built other buildings that are more beautiful, but the Vasari Corridor is probably his most famous.

Vasari's masterpiece is his book, ""The Lives of the Great Architects, Painters and Sculptors of Italy"", first published in 1550. It is a book of biography. It tells the stories of the lives of Italian artists from Giotto who lived around 1300 to Michelangelo who was still alive when Vasari was writing his book. For some of the artists, very little is known about them except the stories that Vasari heard and wrote in his book. Even though nowadays it is known that Vasari sometimes made mistakes, he gives a wonderful picture of the characters of the artists, and tells all sorts of amusing stories. 

Vasari does not just tell the stories of the artists' lives. He also describes their artworks in great detail. It is because of Vasari that art historians know of many important artworks that have been lost. It is because of Vasari that we know that the Mona Lisa once had eyebrows. Vasari writes about the artworks as a history. He believed that the Gothic art of the Middle Ages was not as good as the art of Florence in the 15th century (1400s) and that Michelangelo, who painted in the early 16th century (1500s) was the greatest artist since the days of Ancient Greece. He believed that the change towards the great art of the Renaissance began with Giotto around 1300. Vasari puts all these ideas into his book and shows how one artist learnt from each other, and how the changes in art came about. "Vasari's Lives" is the first art history book that was ever written.

Currently we have a total of 28 admins (including 'crats and CUs). While the vast majority of all active editors are now admins, I have done some calculations and found out that there is currently 4 users who are non-admins but have more than 1000 edits (regardless of experience). Perviously the community has discussed of a possible 100% admin wiki. Currently 87.5% of all users with more than 1k edits are admins. To me I find those figures are quite amazing between the admin : active user ratio, compared to the en wiki for instance. 

Note: As much as I know, I have only found 4 users w/ more than 1k edits. I'm not 100% sure about it so if anyone finds my mistake, please correct me. Thanx:) -- 23:53, 25 January 2008 (UTC)

Hello again, there seem to be some denominations which are rather new (established in the last 25 years or so); one of them is the United Church of God; it split from the , founded by an Adventist; some people see this as a cult. I have written a very basic stub on the United Church of God; the problem is now that the Worldwide Church of God was the parent of more Churches; so before we create more such (possibly on the brink of notability) entries for such movements, would it not be better to focus on getting one such movement for every "bigger" branch of Christianity; like one Anabaptist, one Adventist (..); ideally, we get the one with the most influence or members? -- () 14:00, 26 January 2008 (UTC)

I have moved to . I still have the page listed as a "proposed" policy/guideline though. My question now is: what do we need to do to make it official? Eptalon suggested a week-long vote. I am sort of inclined to think that they've been posted for a month and a half and thus have had that long (plus the time before that when we were discussing whether or not we need new criteria) for someone to oppose and have met no real opposition.

In Germany, an Amt, or Samtgemeinde, or Verbandsgemeinde, or Verwaltungsgemeinschaft is a collection of towns or municipalities in a rural district. The name used depends on which state the district is in.

The Amt joins together several small villages to help with land-use plans, sanitation, the cemetery and fire brigade services or other services that one village is too small to provide for itself.

Larger towns, usually called "free towns", can carry out these services for themselves, and are not part of an "amt".

Gravitation

Gravitation is the scientific statement that all objects having masses try to move toward each other. In everyday life, gravitation is commonly thought of as the weight of an object.

Gravitation keeps the Earth and the other planets in their orbits around the Sun. It keeps the Moon in its orbit around the Earth. It causes tides, convection and many other things that happen. Gravitation is also the reason that the Earth, the Sun, and most other objects in space exist. Without it, matter would not have come together into these big masses. Without gravitation, life as we know it would not exist.

Physics describes gravitation using the theory of general relativity. Newton's law of universal gravitation is very similar to the theory of relativity but much more simple.

The term "gravity" is often used to mean "gravitation". In science, the terms "gravitation" and "gravity" are used differently. "Gravitation" is the theory about the attraction. "Gravity" is the force that pulls objects towards each other.

In the late 17th century, Galileo did a famous experiment about gravity where he dropped balls from the Tower of Pisa. He later rolled balls down inclines. With these experiments, Galileo showed that gravitation accelerates all objects at the same rate regardless of weight.

In 1687, English mathematician Sir Isaac Newton wrote the book "Principia". In this book, he wrote about the inverse-square law of gravitation. Newton said that the closer two objects are to each other, the more gravity will affect them. His theory about gravitation was used to predict the existence of the planet Neptune based on changes in the orbit of Uranus.

Newton's theory was later used to predict the existence of another planet closer to the Sun than Mercury. When this was done, it was learned that his theory was not entirely correct. These mistakes in his theory were corrected by Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Newton's theory is still commonly used for many things because it is much more simple to work with than the theory of General Relativity and is usually accurate enough for many uses.

The Birmingham to Peterborough Line is an important cross-country train track in the United Kingdom, making a connection from the Midlands to East Anglia. Passenger services are given by CrossCountry and East Midlands Trains, serving the following places:

On other tracks (Ely to Peterborough, Breckland and West Anglia) the trains keep going after Peterborough, through March and Ely to Thetford and Norwich or Wendens Ambo (Audley End) and Stansted Airport. Many of them run to Stansted. Services for Norwich come back out of Ely. 

Other services using part of the Birmingham to Peterborough Line include Birmingham to Leicester local (close by) trains. The tracks also have a lot of cargo on the trains, being one of the big train tracks to Birmingham Freightliner Terminal (on the site of Birmingham Lawley Street railway station).

From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler

From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler is a novel by E. L. Konigsburg that won the Newbery Medal for excellence in American children's literature in 1968.

This book tells the story of Claudia Kincaid, an 11-year-old girl who feels unappreciated by her parents. She decides to run away from home just long enough to show her family what they would be missing without her. Unfortunately, she does not enjoy hardship or discomfort, so running away has lots of problems. To solve this problem, Claudia decides to stay at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. She tells her younger brother Jamie to accompany her: he's quiet, but most importantly, he has a secret stash of cash he's gotten by cheating at card games with his best friend, Bruce.

Much of the first part of the novel details how Claudia and Jamie settle in at the museum: blending in with school groups on field trips during the day to get a free presentation, hiding in the restroom at closing time to stay there, and emerging at night to bathe in the fountain and sleep on antique beds. During their stay, they become fascinated with the newest exhibit: a beautiful statue of an angel, thought to have been crafted by Michelangelo. Their time and money are spent trying to find the secret of the statue, hidden somewhere in the unorganized files of the statue's old owner, Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, who lives in Farmington, Connecticut.
She says you can know the secret only if you can find the truth from her mixed up files. They find the truth under the file "Bologna". They go home, and by their choice, Jamie and Claudia turn out to be the grandchildren of Mrs Frankweiler's lawyer, Saxonberg.

This novel was made into a movie in 1973, starring Ingrid Bergman in the title role. It later became a made-for-TV movie in 1995, starring Lauren Bacall in the title role. 

In the television series "The Simpsons", the plot was mimicked in the episodes "Smart and Smarter," in which Lisa hides in a local science museum in embarrassment at finding her baby sister is smarter than she, and the episode "Last Tap Dance in Springfield" features Bart and Milhouse hiding out in the shopping mall for one week while on a camping trip. The movie "The Royal Tenenbaums" has a scence in which characters Margot and Richie hide in a museum; in the movie's DVD commentary, Wes Anderson states that this was an homage to the novel. There is also a reference to the book in "The Office (US TV series)", when Jim Halpert mentions it to a co-worker Kevin's daughter, Abby, and asks her where she'd rather live: the Met, or the aquarium.

Citizenship of the European Union

Citizenship of the European Union was started by the Maastricht Treaty signed in 1992. It is extra to being a citizen of one of the member countries of the European Union, and gives extra rights to nationals of European Union Member States.

Before the Maastricht Treaty (1992), the European Communities treaties allowed workers, and their families, to travel and live in any member country. This idea started when the European Coal and Steel Community was set up by the Treaty of Paris in 1951. This allowed workers in the coal and steel industries to move to another country for work. In 1957, the European Economic Community was set up by the Treaty of Rome. That treaty allowed all workers to move freely .

The European Court of Justice took a wider idea of freedom of movement. The Court said people should be allowed to move to another country to get a better life style, not just to earn more money by working.. The law made by the European Court, the reason the reason a worker wanted to move abroad does not moatter, , they could start part-time and full-time work, and get extra help from the new country.

Other decisions of the ECJ allowed any citizen of a member country live anywhere in the EU. and be treated the same as a citizen of the new country..

The idea of EU citizenship was started by the Maastricht Treaty, and was extended by the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Treaty of Amsterdam said that union citizenship will not replace national citizenship, but only be extra it.

Article 17 (1) of the amended EC Treaty states that Citizenship of the Union is hereby established. Every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union shall complement and not replace national citizenship.

The amended EC Treaty provides the following rights to EU citizens:


Citizens of new countries which join the EU can have some of the rights limited for up to seven years after they join.

<doc id="92208" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92208" title="Messiah (Handel)">
Messiah (Handel)

Messiah is an oratorio by George Frideric Handel. It is Handel’s most famous work, and in England, the most often performed of any big choral work. The title Messiah means “the anointed one” and is the name given to Jesus Christ in the Christian teaching.

George Frideric Handel was born in Germany. When he was a young man he came to England and he liked it so much that he soon visited England again and stayed there for the rest of his life, becoming a naturalised Englishman says the legend. Actually he was composer for the King of Hannover, who then became King of England, and Handel followed his "employer".

The main reason why Handel liked England at that time was because the people liked his music and gave him support. At this time Handel was known as a composer of operas. For about 20 years Handel spent most of his time working on operas: composing them, organising performances and looking for opera singers to sing his works.

By the late 1730s, however, people’s tastes started to change and opera was not so popular. Handel changed to writing oratorios. Although it is thought that Handel invented the oratorio he in fact did not.Oratorio is Italian, after the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri at Rome, where famous musical services were held in the 16th century. Handel is just one composer of many who wrote oratorios. His oratorios are based on the English tradition of the Masque, which was something between a play and an opera. However, oratorios were about stories from the Old Testament. Instead of ancient Gods or Roman emperors (which is what operas were about at that time) he used dramatic stories from the Bible. Among many great oratorios that he wrote, "Messiah" is his most famous one. However, it is different from his other oratorios in some ways.

The words of "Messiah" were written by a librettist Charles Jennens. He chose several passages from the Bible and made a libretto, which he sent to Handel in 1741 (although people today often call the work “The Messiah”, both Handel and Jennens call it “Messiah” without the word “the”). Handel immediately realized that a great work of music could be made from Jennens’ libretto. He thought that Jennens was a very clever person, and in his letters to him he calls the work “Your Oratorio "Messiah"”. Handel sat down in the front room of his house in Brook Street, London, and wrote the whole oratorio in twenty four days. It is a long work, lasting over four hours, and when one thinks that Handel had to write out all the parts for the choir and orchestra, he must have worked unbelievably hard. When he had finished the work, he put it in a drawer for seven weeks. Perhaps he thought it would never be played in London, because at that time the London audiences did not seem to like him.

Just at that time he got an invitation to go to Dublin. He was asked to give a concert to get money for charity. The main charity for which money was being raised was the debtor’s prison. In those days people who ran into debt (meaning that they owed lots of people money but had no money to pay them) were sent to prison. There they were fed by charity (people who fed them out of kindness). If no one fed them they just starved to death. Handel had nearly been sent to a debtor’s prison himself a few years earlier. 

He went to Dublin as soon as he could, and he was there by November. On 23 December he performed his oratorio "L’Allegro". Unlike the London audiences, people in Dublin loved it. This was followed by "Alexander’s Feast", "Imeneo" and, in April, "Messiah". He was a very great success in Dublin, and he stayed there until August, when he returned to London.

The writer Alexander Pope helped people to change their minds and listen to Handel’s new music. He had just published volume 4 of "Dunciad". In this work he said how wonderful Handel’s choruses were. When he heard "Messiah" he must have known that he had written the truth.

"Messiah" tells the story of Christ. It is divided into three parts. Part One tells of the coming and the birth of Christ. Part Two is about his death on the cross, and his Ascension into Heaven, and Part Three has some thoughts about Christ, with words from the books of Job and Corinthians Book One. Handel usually performed his oratorios in theatres, not in churches, and his audience went as a change from going to the opera. They did not go for religious worship. 

Handel’s oratorios are normally dramatic, with the four solo singers (soprano, alto, tenor and bass) each taking the part of a character from the Bible. "Messiah" is different. The soloists sing about the story of Christ. The great choruses, where the choir sings, praise the Lord in the wonderful music. Some of the music is homophonic (e.g. the "Hallelujah" chorus), some of the choruses are dramatic dialogues (e.g. "Lift up your heads"), or they are a fugue ("He trusted in God" and "Amen"), or they describe things dramatically ("All we like sheep").

The most well known of all the movements in The Messiah is the one popularly known as the "Hallelujah Chorus", because of the frequently sung word “Hallelujah”. It occurs at the end of the Part Two of the oratorio.
There is a famous story about King George II
who attended a royal performance of "Messiah". When it came to the "Hallelujah Chorus" he stood up. Whenever the king stood up, everyone in his presence had to stand up, so the whole audience stood. No one is really sure whether the king stood up because he liked the music or for some other reason, but it has become tradition for the audience to stand up when the "Hallelujah Chorus" is sung.

Major General John Murray

"Major General" John Joseph Murray DSO & Bar, MC (born 26 April 1892 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, died 8 September 1951 in Sydney, New South Wales) was an Australian Army Officer and businessman with a special role in both world wars. During World War I, he was "mentioned in despatches" and got got medals while fighting on the Western Front in France. In World War II and he was made commander of the 20th Brigade that helped beat Erwin Rommell's "Afrika Korps" in "Libya".

Murray was born on born 26 April 1892 in Sydney, New South Wales. His father was working man from Ireland. His father was also called John Murray and his mother was called Margaret. 

When he left the local Catholic school John Murray started training as a salesman for Sydney firm Anthony Hordern & Sons in 1910. He then joined the Australian Citizens Military Forces where he served two years before joining the 33rd Regiment in 1913.

John Murray was already in the Australian Army when World War I started on 28 July 1914. He was quickly (fast) made a Second Lieutenant on 6 March 1915. When he started being Second Lieutenant, Murray was moved to the Australian Imperial Force, and went by ship to Egypt. After being posted to the 1st Battalion at first, in March, 1916 he was moved to the 53rd Battalion, which was part of the 5th Division, when the Australian Imperial Force was helped by new soldiers from Australia. The 5th Division was soon moved from Egypt to France where they were put into the hard fighting of the Western Front.

By 19 July 1916 Murray's 53rd Battalion were in the first fighting by the Australian Imperial Force on the Western Front. It was the Battle of Fromelles. 5,533 Australian soldiers were killed, wounded or taken prisoner, because the fighting plan went wrong. The Australian War Memorial sayss the fighting was "the worst 24 hours in Australia's entire history" 

John Murray became a Major in June 1917 and was soon known for his very good leadership and very brave "night raiding" (crossing at night into enemy trenches). In September 1918 during the very hard fighting of the Second Battle of the Somme, Murray's good leadership was mentioned again, and after fights near Peronne, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.

Murray was still fighting on the Western Front when peace started 11 November 1918. Having been awarded the Military Cross and Distinguished Service Order, and also having twice being told of in dispatches he went back home to Australia in May, 1919.

By 25 August 1919 the all of the men in the Australian Imperial Force had been sent home. Murray was happy to go back to his job at Anthony Hordern & Sons in Sydney, but he did not want to stop being a soldier, and he joined the Australian Citizens Military Forces.

On 4 January 1923 John Murray married Mary Madeline Cannon at St. Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, and soon after became the manager of the delivery department at Anthony Hordern & Sons.

By 1925 Murray became a of Lieutenant-Colonel. From 1934 to 1938 Murray was the Commanding Officer of the Australian Army Service Corps, 1st Division.

With war coming again, John Murray was given the command of the 9th Infantry brigade, and they got ready to move for war in February, 1940. He was chosen for the Second Australian Imperial Force in April 1940 and was given command of the 20th Brigade which went by ship to the Middle East in October 1940 to begin training in Palestine.

Murrays brigade was made a part of the 9th Division. Even though the troops were not ready to fight, the 9th Division was sent to Libya to help the 6th Division win Tobruk. 

On 4 April 1941, the "Afrika Korps" starting fighting Murray's 20th Brigade. The Australians slowed down Rommell's forces, but there were so many Germans they could not be forced back. Murray and his troops moved into Tobruk itself. For his leadership, John Murray was granted a "bar" to his Distinguished Service Order (the bar is given instead of a second medal).

Murray's knowledge of Trench warfare and night-raiding was very helpful to the defenders during the Siege of Tobruk. In November 1941, Murray was mentioned in dispatches for the third time in his career for his excellent resistance to Rommell.

Murray returned to Australia in January 1942, just as the Japan was fighting south towards New Guinea. Instead of the recruiting job he expected, Murray was put in charge of the Newcastle Covering Force, and immediately promoted him to temporary Major-General.

The Newcastle Covering Force was soon re-named the 10th Division and Murray was sent to Western Australia in August 1942 to lead the 4th Division which was then moved to North Queensland due to fears of Japanese invasion during April and May 1943.In October 1944, he was made General of the Rear Echelon at Mareeba, before commanding the Northern Territory Force from March, 1945 until January, 1946, when he retired.

John Murray was made Australian trade commissioner to New Zealand from 1946 until 1949 and then the same role for "Ceylon" in 1949. 

General John Murray died on 8 September 1951 at the Military Hospital, Concord, Sydney. He received a funeral with full military honours, and was buried in French's Forest Cemetery. His wife, three sons and two daughters survived him.

During World War II, a subcamp of Flossenburg concentration camp was in Meißen.

Meißen is famous for the manufacture of porcelain. This is because there are big local deposits of china clay (kaolin) and potter's clay (potter's earth). Meißen porcelain was the first high quality porcelain to be produced outside of China.

The first European porcelain was made in Meißen in 1710, when the Royal Porcelain Factory was opened in the Albrechtsburg. In 1861, it was moved to the Triebisch valley of Meißen, where the Meißen porcelain factory can still be found today.

624 Hektor

624 Hektor is the biggest of the Jovian Trojan asteroids. It was found in 1907 by August Kopff.

Hektor is a D-type asteroid, dark and reddish in colour. It lies in Jupiter's leading Lagrangian point, L, called the 'Greek' node after one of the two sides in the legendary Trojan War. Ironically, Hektor is named after the Trojan hero Hektor, and is thus one of two Trojan asteroids that is "misplaced" in the wrong camp (the other being 617 Patroclus in the Trojan node).

Hektor is one of the most stretched bodies of its size in the solar system, being 370 × 200 km. It is thought that Hektor might be a contact binary (two asteroids joined by gravitational attraction) like 216 Kleopatra. Hubble Space Telescope sightings of Hektor in 1993 did not show an obvious stretched shape because of a limited angular resolution. On July 17, 2006, the Keck-10m II telescope and its Laser guide star Adaptive Optics (AO) system indicated a stretched shape for Hektor. Additionally, since this AO system provides an excellent and stable correction (angular resolution of 0.060 arcsec in K band), a 15-km moon at 1000 km from Hektor was found. The moon's provisional designation is S/2006 (624) 1. Hektor is, so far, the only known binary Trojan asteroid in the L point and the first Trojan with a moon. 617 Patroclus, another big Trojan asteroid located in the L, is made of two same-sized asteroids.

Younha

Younha (Korean: 고윤하; Hanja: 高允河 Go Yoon Ha Japanese: ユンナ Yunna), born 29 April 1988 in Seoul, Korea, is a Korean pop singer.

Younha made her debut at the age of sixteen. Nicknamed the "Oricon comet" for her success in Japan, she has currently released eight singles and one album in that country with varying degrees of success. Also, many of her songs have been featured in TV shows.

Younha was signed to Epic Records, a branch of Sony Music Entertainment Japan, from 2004 to 2008. She then moved to Sistus Records, a Geneon Entertainment label. In South Korea, she is signed to Lion Media and Stam Entertainment.

Born in South Korea to musical parents, Younha began to play the piano at the age of 4. She developed an interest in Japanese drama shows and began to teach herself Japanese. Before long, she was skilled enough to translate to her school friends what happened on recent Japanese TV episodes. What began as an interest in Japanese dramas developed into an interest in Japanese music. At the recommendation of an older student in her school's broadcasting club, she listened to such artists such as Utada Hikaru and Misia. Younha began to dream about debuting as a singer alongside her favorite artists.

In order to seek her dreams, she began to try out in auditions within Korea. She claimed that she went through as many as 20 auditions. She also commented in her interview that certain companies refused to sign her to their labels because they believed she was not "pretty" enough, although she sang very well. Her mother also discouraged her dream and even locked her bedroom door to prevent Younha from leaving the house. Younha, however, climbed out the window and made it to the audition. At one audition, she made an overwhelming impression and signed a contract with a Korean company. Soon after, Younha's voice was heard by a company in Japan. In order to make her childhood dream of debuting in Japan come true, Younha underwent recording while going back and forth between Korea and Japan. Quickly, Younha's Japanese skills advanced so much that she surprised even the staff around her.

After a TV drama producer heard her demo tape, her song "Yubikiri" was chosen as the insert song for the Fuji TV Monday drama show "Tokyo Wankei ~Destiny of Love~". In October of that same year, she debuted with her official first single "Yubikiri".

Younha's second single "Houkiboshi" was used as an ending song for the popular anime show "BLEACH". It became a hit - debuting on the Oricon chart at #18, it peaked at #12 and propelled Younha into the limelight. With this single, she became only the second Korean, after BoA, to have broken the Oricon chart's top 20. Between "Touch / Yume no Tsuzuki" and "Houki Boshi", she released "Motto Futari de". It flopped massively, only reaching #117 on the Oricon Charts possibly due to a lack of promotion. Her later single, "Touch / Yume no Tsuzuki", first charted at the #15, with the tie-in and went as high as #11. After releasing five singles, Younha released her first album entitled "Go! Younha". It reached the #10 spot on the Oricon weekly charts.

"My Lover" was a re-cut single from Go! Younha, her debut album, and was re-cut because it was the theme to the "Bleach GC: Tasogare Ni Mamieru Shini Kami". It was limited to 70,000 copies and flopped, selling only about 2,000 copies, ranking at #58. Because of the limited print, however, it has become extremely valuable and rare to the fans. Younha was also chosen to sing the ending theme to the anime "Jyu Oh Sei". "Tewo Tsunaide" only did slightly better than "My Lover", peaking at #50. 

Younha began to compose her own music. The song "Kaerimichi" released on "My Lover" is the first song released for which she wrote the lyrics and composed the music for. In addition, she composed the music for the song "homegirl", the B-side released on "Te wo Tsunaide".

"Imaga Daisuki" was released, with more live performances than "Te wo Tsunaide", and a tie-in. It seemed that Younha has a bigger budget on this single. It did significantly worse, as her second worst ranking single, at #71. "Imaga Daisuki" was also used as an opening song for the animation Jang Geum's Dream while the b-track "Inori" was used for the animation's ending song.

Younha released a digital Korean single titled "Audition". The single includes "Audition (Time 2 Rock)" and "Waiting (기다리다)". Although it was released as a digital single, very limited hard copies of the single were available as well. Many performances for this song were shown on Korean TV, unusual for Younha as her last appearance on TV was with her single "Touch." Much promotion occurred for this single and it helped for a long charting life for "Audition", lasting well over 3 months in all the Korean charts. She stayed in Korea during this release, as well as January.

Younha was once again chosen to be an anime theme singer for "Kiba". The song "Hakanaku Tsuyoku" was used as the second opening for the show. The single was released on 17 January 2007. This single, unlike her other singles, has only 3 tracks. Surprisingly, this single appeared on the Top 20 Daily Charts for exactly one day, at #16. The Weekly rank was at an above-average #36, but sales were only slightly better. This single did not have a PV because Younha was in Korea during the month before and most likely January as well.

Exactly two months after "Hakanaku Tsuyoku", Younha went back to her home country to release her first Korean Album entitled "고백하기 좋은 날" (Go Baek Ha Gi Jo Eun Nal, translated "The Perfect Day to Say I Love You" or literally translated "Good Day to Confess"). She recorded a MV for the third track "비밀번호 486" (Bi Mil Bun Ho 486, translated "Password 486") which stars fellow Stam artist Yoon Ji Hoo. The video featured many image changes for Younha which include her first ever kiss. The album also features a collaboration with Wheesung.

With the single welcomed well into the market, Younha proceeded to release her Korean debut album. The album received excellent success, peaking at #1 on the charts. The first song to be promoted from the album was 비밀번호 486 (Bi Mil Bun Ho 486, translated "Password 486"). She won the SBS Inkigayo Mutizen award twice for Secret Number 486. This song was also well received by the Korean audience. The second song to be promoted from this album was 연애조건 (Yeonae Jogeon, translated "Love Condition").

On July 14th 2007, Younha appeared on the Korean GomTV MSL Grand Finals (Starcraft tournament) and played in the opening ceremony.

Younha has also been picked as publicity envoy for the anti-corruption Clean Wave Campaign for her pure and clean image.

At the 2007 MKMF held on November 17th 2007, Younha won the Best New Solo Artist award.

With Younha's success rising, she released a new version of Go! Younha, all re-recorded in Korean. The album, with tracklist changes, is now called 혜성 (Comet), and was released on October 23.

On January 18th, Younha left Korea to continue her music career in Japan. She is expecting to release a new Japanese Album/Music Video DVD, "SONGS-Teen's Collection. " This Collection is expected to include all of her music videos so far, plus a 32 page photobook, in the limited edition of the disk. The release date of this album is March 26th, and on-line Music Shops already have started getting pre-orders. For information about pre-ordering, contact http://www.jkm.co.kr or http://www.leesmusic.co.kr/ (both Korean)

Younha sang the song "Boku wa Koko ni Iru" on the tribute album to Masayoshi Yamazaki, ""One More Time, One More Track"". (12.21.05)

Younha was selected as one of 14 female artists to perform in the omnibus album ""14 Princess ~Princess Princess Children~"", a collection of the most famous songs by the top girls band Princess Princess of late 80's and early 90's. Younha performed the song "Diamonds", which was the number 1 seller of the year 1989 in Japan. (03.08.06)

This is the discography of pop artist 'Younha'.

The word Benedictine usually refers to a follower of the Order of Saint Benedict. These people usually lead a life in an abbey. They follow the rule of Benedict of Nursia. Benedict lived in the 6th century. He made some rules, called the Rule of St Benedict these people follow. The rules can be summed up by "pax" ("peace") and "ora et labora" ("pray and work"). 

Most Benedictines see themselves as part of the Catholic Church. Some can also be found in the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Anglican Church. Officially, the order is known as "Ordo Sancti Benedicti" ("OSB").

The term Cistercian is used to refer to an order of Roman Catholic monks. Officially the order is called "Ordo Cisterciensis" ("OCist"), or "Sacer Ordo Cisterciensis" ("SOC"). These people follow the same rules as the Benedictines, that is to say those of St Benedict. Over time, the Benedictines made some changes to the rules and the way of life. 

The Cistercians reject these. They went back to what St Benedict had taught. Sometimes their rules were more strict than those St Benedict had given. They also went back to manual labour, especially work in the fields. Because of this, the Cistercians helped spread technologies around Medieval Europe. In 1882 certain monasteries formed a new order, called the Trappists. With time, they split completely from the Cistercians.

Langston Hughes

Langston Hughes (1902 – May 22, 1967) was a famous American poet, novelist, playwright and short story writer. Hughes was one of the writers and artists whose work was called the Harlem Renaissance.

Hughes grew up as a poor boy from Missouri, the descendant of African people who had been taken to America as slaves. At that time, the term used for African-Americans was "Negro" which means a person with black skin. Most "Negroes" did not remember or think about their link with the people of Africa, even though it was a big influence on their culture and, in particular, their music. Hughes was unusual for his time, because he went back to West Africa to understand more about his own culture. Through his poetry, plays and stories, Hughes helped other black Americans to see themselves as part of a much bigger group of people, so that now the term "African-American" is used with pride.

Hughes became a famous writer, but all his life he remembered how he started out, and he helped and encouraged many other struggling writers.

Langston Hughes was born on February 1,1902 in Joplin,Missouri. His parents were James Nate dog Hughes and Carrie Langston Hughes who was a teacher. Langston's father, James Hughes, was so upset about the racism towards African-Americans that he left his family and moved to Mexico. Young Langston was cared for by his grandmother, in Lawrence, Kansas while his mother worked to support the family. Langston's Grandmother was a great story teller. She told stories that made him feel proud to be an African-American. 

After his grandmother died Hughes went to live with some family friends for a time, and then, as a teenager went to live in Lincoln, Illinois, with his mother, who had remarried. He was often left alone because his mom was at work. Even though his childhood was difficult and had lots of changes, he was able to use these things in the poetry that he started to write while he was at school. He never forgot the stories of his grandmother and tried to help other African-Americans when they were having problems. These were the people that he later wrote about in his own stories.

When Hughes went to school in Lincoln, there were only two African-American children in the class. The teacher talked to them about poetry. She said that what a poem needed most was rhythm. Langston later said that he had rhythm in his blood because, " bib ware
as everyone knows", "all" African-Americans have rhythm. The children made him the "class poet".

At high school in Cleveland, Ohio, Langston learned to love reading. He loved the poetry of the American poets Paul Laurence Dunbar and Carl Sandburg. He wrote articles for the school newspaper, he edited the school yearbook and he wrote his first short stories and plays.

When Langston Hughes was 17 he went to spend some time with his father in Mexico. He was so unhappy while he was there that he thought about committing suicide. Hughes could not understand how his father felt. He said: "I had been thinking about my father and his strange dislike of his own people. I didn't understand it, because I was a Negro, and I liked Negroes very much!"

Hughes later wrote this poem: 

When he was finished at high school in Lincoln in 1920, he went back to Mexico, to ask his father to pay for him to go to university. Hughes' father was a lawyer and a wealthy landowner. He could afford to send his son to university but he made difficulties about it. He said that Hughes could only go to university if he went overseas and studied engineering. Hughes wanted to go to university in the US. After a time, they made an agreement that he should go to Columbia University but study engineering, not an arts degree. He went to Columbia in 1921 but left in 1922, partly because of the racism in the university.

Until 1926 Hughes did many different types of work. In 1923 he went as a crewman on the ship "S.S.Malone" and went to West Africa and Europe. He left the ship and stayed for a short time in Paris where he joined several other African-Americans who were living there. In November 1924, Hughes returned to the U.S. to live with his mother in Washington, D.C.. In 1925 he got a job as an assistant to Carter G. Woodson who worked with the "Association for the Study of African American Life and History". Hughes did not enjoy his work because he did not have enough time to write, so he left and got a job as a "busboy", wiping tables and washing dishes at a hotel. Hughes is sometimes called "The Busboy Poet". Meanwhile, some of his poems were published in magazines and were being collected together for his first book of poetry. While he was working at the hotel he met the poet Vachel Lindsay, who helped to make Hughes known as a new African-American poet.

In 1926 Hughes began studying at Lincoln University, Pennsylvania. He had help from patrons, Amy Spingarn, who gave him $300 and "Godmother" Charlotte Osgood Mason. Hughes graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1929 and became a Doctor of Letters in 1943. He was also given an honorary doctorate by Howard University. For the rest of his life, except when he travelled to the Caribbean or West Indies, Hughes lived in Harlem, New York.

Langston Hughes sometimes went out with women, but he never married. People who have studied his life and poetry are sure that he was homosexual. In the 1930s it was harder to be open about being gay than it is nowadays. His poetry has lots of symbols which are used by other homosexual writers. Hughes thought that men who had very dark skin were particularly beautiful. It seems from his poetry that he was in love with an African-American man. He also wrote a story which might tell of his own experience. "Blessed Assurance" is the story of a father's anger because his son is "queer" and acts like a girl.

Hughes' life and work were an important part of the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, alongside those Zora Neale Hurston, Wallace Thurman, Countee Cullen, Richard Bruce Nugent, and Aaron Douglas, who together started a magazine "Fire!! Devoted to Younger Negro Artists". Hughes and these friends did not always agree with the ideas of some of the other African-American writers who were also part of the "Harlem Renaissance" because they thought their ideas were Middle class and that they treated others who had darker skin, less education and less money with discrimination. All his life, Hughes never forgot the lessons that he learned about poor and uneducated African-Americans in the stories that his grandmother told.

In 1960, the "NAACP" awarded Hughes the "Spingarn Medal" for "distinguished achievements by an African American". Hughes became a member of the "National Institute of Arts and Letters" in 1961. In 1973, an award was named after him, the "Langston Hughes Medal", awarded by the City College of New York.

Hughes became a famous American poet, but he was always ready to help other people, particularly young black writers. He was worried that many young writers hated themselves, and expressed these feelings to the world. He tried to help people feel pride, and not worry about the prejudice of other people. He also tried to help young African-Americans not to express hatred and prejudice towards white Americans.

Hughes wrote: 

On May 22, 1967, Hughes died at the age of 65 after having surgery for cancer. His ashes are buried under the floor of the "Langston Hughes Auditorium" in the "Arthur Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture" in Harlem. Over his ashes is a circle with a beautiful African design called "Rivers." At the centre of the design are words from a poem by Hughes: ""My soul has grown deep like the rivers."

Geographic coordinate system

A Geographical Coordinate System is a Coordinate system. This means that every place can be specified by a set of three numbers, called coordinates. 

A full circle can be divided into 360 degrees (or 360°); this was first done by the Babylonians; Ancient Greeks, like Ptolemy later extended the theory.

Today, degrees are divided further. There are minutes, and seconds; 1 minute (or 1') in this context is 1/60 of a degree; 1 second (or 1") is 1/60 of a minute.

The first concept needed is called "latitude" (Lat, or the Greek symbol "phi", formula_1). For it, the Earth is cut up into 180 circles, from the Equator. The poles are at 90°, the North Pole is at 90° N(orth), the South Pole is at 90° S(outh). Places with the same latitude are on a circle, around the Earth.

The other concept is called "longitude" (Long, or the Greek symbol "lambda", formula_2), sometimes referred to as "meridian". The 0° longitude line (or zero meridian) goes through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. Greenwich is a part of London. Then lines are drawn in a similar way; the opposite (or "antipodal") meridian of Greenwich is considered both 180°W(est), and 180°E(ast).

The third number is the height, altitude, or depth. This is given with respect to some fixed (usually easily calculable point). One of these is called Mean Sea Level.

Weighing scale

Scales are used to measure the weight of an item. To use a scale, the item which needs to be weighed is put on one side of the scale. Then, weigh stones are put on the other side. Once the scale balances (that is the indicator between the two scales is in the middle), the correct weight was chosen.

There are also modern scales, where the item is simply put on the scale. Its weight can then be read from an electronic or analogue display. 

Weighting Scales are used to measure the weight of an item. To use a scale, the item which needs to be weighed is put on one side of the scale. Then, usually stones are put on the other side to compare the weight of the stone with the weight of the object you have chosen. If both cups are in the middle, it means that the weights of the objects are equal. If one cup is more up while the other one is down, it means that the one that is down is the heavier one. For example: If you place a small stone in one cup, and a watch in the other cup, and the cup with the watch goes down and the stone obviously goes up, it means that the watch has a greater weight than the stone.

STS-122

STS-122 is the name of the 121 flight of the Space Shuttle, taking seven people into outer space to visit the International Space Station. The flight is being made to deliver a new module to the space station, called "Columbus". It is being made by the Space Shuttle called "Atlantis". The flight started at 19:45 GMT, on 7 February 2008, from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The flight ended on 20 February, at 14:07 GMT, when the Shuttle went back to the Kennedy Space Center.

Seven people are aboard the Space Shuttle. They are; Stephen Frick, who is the Commander, the man in charge of the Space Shuttle, Alan G. Poindexter, who is the Pilot, the man who flys the Shuttle, Leland D. Melvin, Rex J. Walheim, Hans Schlegel and Stanley G. Love, who are there to fit the "Columbus" onto the space station. Léopold Eyharts is also on board. He will live on the Space Station for a month, after the Shuttle leaves. Daniel M. Tani, who is on the space station will come home aboard the Shuttle.

The flight was originally scheduled to launch, or start, on 6 December 2007. A problem with a part of the fuel tank used to work out how much fuel was left went wrong, which meant the start of the flight had to be delayed. After the same part went wrong in an attempt to start the flight on 9 December, the start of the flight was moved to January 2008, and later to February. The flight started on 7 February 2008. Some people at NASA were worried that bad weather might stop the launch, but the bad weather cleared up in time for a good launch.

<br clear="both">
The people aboard STS-122 had several jobs to do. The main job was to add the new room, or module, "Columbus", to the space station. To do this, a robot arm, called a Remote Manipulator System, or RMS, will be used to lift "Columbus" out of the Space Shuttle, and move it over to a gap in the side of the space station. Two of the crew will then go outside, and fit parts to the module. "Columbus" will be used for scientific research.

Silverwing (novel)

Silverwing is a best-selling novel, written by Kenneth Oppel, published in 1997 by Simon & Schuster It tells the story of a group of silverwing bats. The tone and artistic honour of this series of bestsellers has been compared to the classic animal novel "Watership Down". Silverwing is the second installment of the Silverwing series, following the prequel Darkwing.

The first book has been made into a successful 13 episode, animated television mini-series, shown on the Canadian cable channel Teletoon and currently being shown on Toon Disney's Jetix. These episodes have also been strung together to make 3 movies. The whole series is now available on DVD.

The main character is a runt named Shade. The novel and its sequel, "Sunwing", tell the story of the hard time of Shade and his friends to find his father and free his "fellow bats" from an ancient and unjust punishment. The second sequel, "Firewing", describes the adventures of Shade's child.

The bats' punishment came about long ago when a great war was fought between the birds and the land animals. The bats, sharing aspects of both, declared themselves neutral. As a result, the bats were only allowed to come out at night, never to see the sun again without suffering terrible penalties (the backstory is inspired by one of Aesop's fables). Shade sets the main plot of the novel in motion when he breaks that law, and starts a chain of events that leads to the destruction of his group's home, forcing their premature migration, and his separation from them. 

When he's separated from his group he is found by a Brightwing bat named Marina, and soon the two are in a city where pigeons are very angry with the two bats. They are soon being beaten by the pigeons. The reason is that "two giant cannibal bats" have killed a few pigeons, and Shade and Marina are being held responsible for the killings.

While the two small bats escape, the scene changes to the two giant bats ("Vampyrum spectrum", the False Vampire Bat) on the night they escape. Their names are Goth and Throbb, two carnivorous bats who have only been chasing mice for a while. They escape from the humans who trapped them.

Soon after escaping Shade meets with a bat named Zephyr (who reveals to him that his father is still alive) and is attacked by an owl (who is also chasing him after the death of the pigeons). Goth defends him by attacking and eating the owl, and introduces himself and where he's going. It turns out he needs Shade's help to find his jungle. Shade suggests that he can find his group first and they can help Goth in his search for his homeland. Marina believes that Goth and Throbb should not be trusted, but Shade trusts them since they saved them from the owl. 

Soon Shade realizes the truth when he sees Throbb eating a Brightwing. Shade runs off but runs into Marina, whom he feared had been killed. They soon escape after Goth and Throbb are shot by darts from a human flying machine, which is actually an airplane. Shade saw the dart hit Goth in the chest. Yet he is not sure whether the dart hit Throbb.

Soon after they meet with Goth and Throbb again, but escape into the sewer where they meet the rat twins, Romulus and Remus. They are treated as spies by Prince Remus, and as punishment are sent to be eaten by Remus's crazy brother Romulus (who considers himself half bat because of the skin webbing between his legs and arms)but he turns out to be not crazy after all (he only pretends to be crazy to avoid being killed by his brother Remus, as the elder brother Romulus is the rightful Prince) frees them in the end. 

They are soon captured by Goth and Throbb, and Goth explains about his god, Cama Zotz, saying that the said Zotz has greater power than Shade's Nocturna. When Shade half-believes Goth's story, he soon gives the impression of deciding to go with Goth to the jungle to grow big and strong and have Goth kill his family because he was always mistreated, and never cared for, or so he says. He is given a bat to eat but fakes it first then is forced to eat it by the threat to Marina. This disgusting act gives him the opportunity to drug Goth and Throbb with a soporific herb. While the False Vampires sleep, Shade and Marina escape. They are chased by owls, then by Goth and Throbb. During the fight Throbb gets hit by lightning and bursts into flames. Goth survives, but only by a scant margin.

After they leave, however, Goth moves again, and kills a bird near him. The last moments the bird saw was a set of double rowed teeth. Although weak he tries to fly; once he does, he soon vows revenge against Shade.

Shade and Marina meet up with Shade's group, telling stories of what had happened to them. They decide to find Shade's father, Cassiel, and Chinook volunteers to help. They plan to go after hibernating, but Shade wishes to go now. It ends with Shade starting to fall asleep, with Ariel and Marina roosting beside him.

Shade Silverwing is the protagonist of the series. He is a runt Silverwing, and often made fun of by his peers, who take pride in their size and strength. While Shade's strength may be lower than the other bats', he is a master of the sound, often making illusions or moving materials with echoes. 

Marina Brightwing is Shade's newfound friend. When Shade had been blown away by the storm, she met him. She is a lot bigger than Shade, and does not fail to remind him of it.

Chinook is Shade's competitor and the biggest and strongest newborn of the group. All the bats like him, and he said he caught two tiger moths which are known by all the others in the group to be an extraordinary achievement by such a young bat. Shade loathes him for his airs and size. Shade and Chinook become friends later in the story. His parents are Plato and Isis. 

Frieda is an older bat of the Silverwing group. She is wise in many ways, and makes good decisions. Frieda has a silver band on her forearm. She was a big contributor to the rebellion against the owls fifteen years previous.

Ariel is Shade's mother. She had protected Shade from the wrath of the rest of the group. She had lost her mate, Cassiel, before Shade was born.

Goth is a sly and smooth-talking cannibal bat, half responsible for the killing of many pigeons. He is a prince in his own group, and worships Cama Zotz, the brother of Nocturna, whom the Silverwings and other bats like them believe in. Goth comes from the jungle, and had been captured by humans.

Throbb is another one of the cannibal bats. Unlike Goth, he is a coward and according to Goth he feeds on carcasses already killed by other cannibal bats in the jungle.

Space Shuttle Columbia

The Space Shuttle "Columbia" (OV-102)was a spacecraft used by NASA to fly into outer space. It was the first Space Shuttle to fly into space, on April 12, 1981. It broke apart while re-entering the Earths atmosphere on February 1, 2003, killing all seven people who were on it at the time. The shuttle flew a total of 28 missions. The Columbia was named after a US Navy ship that circumnavigated the world in 1836. It was also the name of the Apollo 11 Lunar Excursion Module.

A piece of insulating foam from the external fuel tank peeled off during the launch 16 days earlier and struck the shuttle's left wing.
A hole was punctured in the leading edge of the wing. During the intense heat of re-entry, hot gases entered the interior of the wing, destroying the support structures and causing the rest of the shuttle to break apart.

So far, Atlas V has made 12 flights:

There are many types of Atlas V, which can be changed for different spacecraft. The type of rocket is denoted by three numbers following the rocket's name. The first of these is either a four or a five, and is the width of the part of the rocket known as the fairing, where the satellite is stored. The second can be anything between zero and five, and gives the number of booster rockets used to increase the load the rocket can carry. The third is either a one or a two, and denotes the number of engines on the upper stage. For example, the Atlas V 401 has a four metre fairing, no booster rockets, and one engine on the upper stage, an Atlas V 552 has a five metre fairing, five boosters, and two engines on the upper stage.

Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (21 March 1768 – 30 May 1830) was a French mathematician and physicist. He is best known for starting the investigation of Fourier series. He used them for work on problems of heat flow. Fourier also discovered the greenhouse effect.

Fourier was born at Auxerre as the son of a tailor. He lost both his parents at the age of 9. He then went on to study at the Convent of St Mark.

He joined the military academy in Auxerre. Aged sixteen, he became a teacher. At age 26, he entered the École normale supérieure in Paris. People like Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Gaspard Monge, and Pierre-Simon de Laplace were among his teachers. 

He took part in the French Revolution of 1789. During the Reign of Terror he was almost executed at the guillotine, but the death of Robespierre saved him this fate. He later took part in the French campaign in Egypt and Syria. 

Later, as a diplomat, he is put in charge of the scientific background of the Institut d'Égypte. On his return, Napoleon put him in charge of the Isère department. 

In 1810, Fourier created the university in Grenoble, and becomes its first head. In 1817, Fourier became a Member of the Académie des Sciences. On the death of Jean-Baptiste Joseph Delambre in 1822 he became head of the mathematics section. In 1826, Fourier was elected to the Académie française.

<doc id="92432" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92432" title="Impressionism">
Impressionism

Impressionism is a style of painting which began in France in the late 19th century. "Impressionist" painting shows life-like subjects painted in a broad quick style, with brushstrokes that are easily seen and colours that are often bright. The name "Impressionism" comes from a painting by Claude Monet, which he showed in an exhibition with the name "Impression, soleil levant" ("Impression, Sunrise"). An art critic called Louis Leroy saw the exhibition and wrote a review in which he said that all the paintings were just "impressions". The word stuck. 

Impressionist painters are mostly known for their work in oil paint on canvas. Some Impressionist painters also made watercolours and prints. There is also some Impressionist sculpture.

In the 19th century, most artists learned to paint by attending an art school, called an academy. The academies were very strict about the way that young artists learnt to paint. The popular style of painting was called "Classicism". Classical paintings were always done inside a studio. They often showed stories from mythology. An artist would prepare for a painting by doing lots of drawings. The paintings were very smoothly and carefully painted. 

At the same time there were several painters who loved to paint the French landscape and the village people in a realist way that was different from Classicism. They would often make small quick paintings out of doors, and then finish them in the studio. These artists include Gustave Courbet and Jean-Baptiste Corot. Edgar Degas wrote in 1883: "There is one master, Corot. We are nothing in comparison, nothing." A group of young painters who admired the work of these artists became friends and started painting together. These artists were Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Frédéric Bazille, Camille Pissarro, Paul Cézanne, and Armand Guillaumin. 

Every year the academy in Paris would hold a big exhibition (art show) called the "Salon de Paris". In 1863 an artist called Edouard Manet put a picture into the show called "Lunch on the Grass" ("Le déjeuner sur l'herbe"). The judges at the Salon refused to hang this work in the gallery because it showed a naked woman sitting on the grass with two men wearing clothes. If the painting had been about Ancient Greek mythology, this would not be a problem but these men were wearing ordinary suits, and the woman's dress and hat were lying on the grass. Perhaps she was a prostitute! The judges said that the painting was indecent (very rude). Monet and his friends also had their paintings turned away. They were angry and they met with Manet to discuss this. The Emperor Napoleon III gave permission for another exhibition called the "Salon des Refuses" which showed all the pictures that had been "refused". Many people went to see this exhibition and soon discovered that there was a new "movement" in art, quite different from the style that they were used to. 
In 1872 Monet and his friends formed a society called the ""Cooperative and Anonymous Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers"". They began to organize their own art show. In 1874 thirty artists held their first exhibition. The critic Louis Leroy made fun of their work and wrote an article called "The Exhibition of the Impressionists". The public who came to the exhibition also began to use this name. The painters themselves soon started to use the name "Impressionists" and they have been called by that name ever since. They had eight exhibitions between 1874 and 1886. They paid a dealer called Paul Durand-Ruel to organise exhibitions, and he arranged shows in London and New York. Bit by bit, their paintings became popular. Some of the Impressionists, Monet and Renoir, lived to be old and famous, but others died very poor. The main artists who are called "Impressionists" include Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Edgar Degas, Berthe Morisot, Armand Guillaumin, Mary Cassatt, Gustave Caillebotte and Frederic Bazille. 

Many artists worked with the Impressionists for a short time, but then began to try out new ideas. These artists all painted in different ways, but together are called the Post-Impressionists. They include Georges Seurat, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Vincent van Gogh. 

While the French Impressionist painters were at work in France, painters in other countries were also beginning to paint outdoors in a broader style. Eventually the Impressionist style spread to many countries across Europe, to North America and Australia. Some artists continued to paint in the Impressionist style right through the 20th century.
<br clear=all>

Before the time of the Impressionists, many artists worked by painting portraits. Before the invention of the camera, painted portraits were the main way to record a person's "appearance" (what they looked like). But by the time the Impressionists started painting, there were many photographers who had studios where people could go to be photographed. As cameras improved, photographers started taking "snapshots" of scenery and people outdoors. 

Photography had two effects on painters. Firstly, it meant that it was much harder for them to live by painting portraits. Many artists became very poor. Secondly, the image taken by a camera often has interesting angles and viewpoints that are not usually painted by artists. Impressionist painters were able to learn from photographs. Many Impressionist paintings make the viewer feel as if they were right there, looking at the scene through the eyes of the artist.

Impressionist painters did not paint from their imagination, from literature, history or mythology like most other painters of the 19th century. They painted what they saw in the world around them: the town where they lived, the landscape where they went on holiday, their family, their friends, their studios and the things that were around their home. Sometimes they were "commissioned" (given a job) to paint a portrait of someone. 

Impressionist painters liked to paint "ordinary" things that were part of everyday life. They painted women doing the washing and ironing, ballet dancers doing exercises, horses getting ready for a race and a bored-looking waitress serving a customer. Nobody, before the Impressionists, had ever thought that these subjects were interesting enough to paint.

Even though many Impressionist artists painted people, they are thought of mainly for their landscape painting. Impressionist painters were not satisfied with doing some drawings or quick painted sketches outdoors and then making grand pictures in the studio. Impressionist painters were not satisfied with painting the shape of the land, the buildings and trees. They wanted to capture the light and the weather.

The Impressionist painters looked for a "technique" (a way of doing something) to paint landscapes that showed the light and the weather. The light and the weather change all the time. The light of the sun on the landscape changes every minute as the Earth turns. Impressionist painters looked at the works of earlier French artists such as Camille Corot and Gustave Coubet. Courbet often took his paints outdoors and made quick coloured sketches that he could then use to make large paintings in his studio. The Impressionist painters were more interested in the sketches than the finished paintings. 

Another artist, Eugene Boudin, used to sit on the beach at Deauville with his oil paints, and make quick paintings of the people on holiday. They would sometimes buy his paintings as souvenirs. 

Claude Monet met Boudin and learnt that the only way to "capture" the way that a landscape looked at a particular time was to paint small pictures, very quickly, and without bothering to mix the paints up to make nice smooth even colours. Impressionist painters would use big brushstrokes of different bright colours and let them get mixed up on the canvas, instead of carefully mixing them up on a palette first. By painting in this way, without bothering with the details, Impressionist painters capture a realistic "impression" of a the world that they saw around them. 

Some of the things that they painted were: snow gently falling over a town, mist rising on a river in the pink morning light, people walking through a field of wheat with bright red poppies growing in it, sunlight dappling through leaves onto people dancing, a train sending up clouds of smoke in a big railway station, and water lillies floating on a pool under drooping willows. 

Most Impressionist landscape paintings are small, so that the artist could carry them outdoors. Some artists, particularly Claude Monet, would take several canvases, and as the day went on and the light changed, he would put down one and take up another. He rented a room from which he could see Rouen Cathedral so that he could paint it from the window at different times of day. Monet also did a series of "Haystack" paintings, showing them standing in the field from different angles and in all sorts of weather, bright sunshine, morning frost and snow. Paintings that are done outdoors are called "plein air" paintings. The Impressionist painters often used to go out together on painting trips, so there are many pictures that can be compared.
<br clear=all>

The term "impressionism" has been used for other forms of art, such as writing and music. Octave Mirbeau is often described as an impressionist writer. In 1887, music critics said the works of Claude Debussy were "impressionist". Later, other composers were also described as "impressionist", including Maurice Ravel, Paul Dukas, Erik Satie and Albert Roussel.

Simlish is spoken by Sims, the characters in "The Sims", "The Sims 2" and "The Sims 3".

All of these phrases are from "The Sims", "not" "The Sims 2".

Written Simlish is only seen on "The Sims 2" and "The Sims 3". It looks similar to Zodiac symbols taken from the Wingdings font on a computer.

His coup failed thanks to King Juan Carlos I. Tejero thought the King would support him because the King had been trained by Spain's old dictator, Francisco Franco. Instead King Juan Carlos I went on television dressed in his uniform as commander-in-chief of the Spanish Army and said the coup was wrong. The coup soon stopped, and Spanish television had pictures of the coup leaders trying to escape by climbing out of the windows of the parliament building

Marcel-François Lefebvre (November 29 1905 – March 25 1991), better known as Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, was a French Roman Catholic bishop. For a long time, he worked as a missionary in Africa with the Holy Ghost Fathers. After returning, he started to be against the changes within the Church. These changes were introduced after the Second Vatican Council.

In 1970, Lefebvre founded the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX), which is still the world's largest Traditionalist Catholic priestly society. In 1988, Lefebvre made four new bishops to continue his work with the SSPX. He took this step against the orders of Pope John Paul II. Because of this, the Holy See announced the following day that he had been excommunicated from the Catholic Church. Those who supported Lefebvre think, this declaration was not valid.

Second Vatican Council

The Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican, or Vatican II, was the twenty-first Ecumenical Council of the Roman Catholic Church. Pope John XXIII started it in 1962. It lasted until 1965, when Pope Paul VI ended it. Four future popes took part in the council's opening session: Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini, who on succeeding Pope John XXIII took the name of Paul VI; Bishop Albino Luciani, the future Pope John Paul I; Bishop Karol Wojtyła, who became Pope John Paul II. Father Joseph Ratzinger, who was only 35 at the time, was there as a theological consultant. More than forty years later, he became the current Pope Benedict XVI. 

Different things were discussed. These aimed at modernising the church, and opening a dialogue with other religions. Many people see these meetings as the most important event in the Catholic Church in the 20th century. They let Mass be in different languages.

Lourdes (Occitan name "Lorda") is a town and commune in the southwest of the Hautes-Pyrénées department. It is in the first Pyrenean foothills, in southwestern France.

It is overlooked from the south by the Pyrenean peaks of Aneto, Montaigu, and Vignemale (3,298m), while around the town there are three summits reaching up to 1,000 m, which are known as the Béout, the Petit Jer and the Grand Jer.

Lourdes was originally a small unremarkable market town lying in the foothills of the Pyrenees. At that time the most prominent feature was the fortified castle which rises up from the centre of the town on a rock. Following the claims that there were apparitions of Our Lady of Lourdes to Bernadette Soubirous in 1858, Lourdes has developed into a major place of Christian pilgrimage.

Today Lourdes has a population of around 15,000 inhabitants but is able to take in some 5,000,000 pilgrims and tourists every season. Lourdes has the second greatest number of hotels in France after Paris with about 270 establishments.

It is the joint seat of the diocese of Tarbes-et-Lourdes.

Thomas Morley

Thomas Morley (born Norwich?, 1557 or 1558; died London, October 1602) was an English composer, music theorist and organist. He was the most important English composer of madrigals. He studied the madrigals by Italian composers and created the tradition of the English madrigal, a tradition that became extremely popular, but which only lasted about 30 years.

Morley’s father was a brewer who lived in Norwich, so it is likely that Morley was born there. He may have been a choirboy in Norwich Cathedral. We know that in 1583 he got the job of organist there. In a book he published later in his life he said that William Byrd was his master. If this means that he had lessons from Byrd he must have travelled away from Norwich. In 1588 he got a degree from Oxford, and soon afterwards he became an organist at St. Paul's Cathedral in London.

In 1588 Nicholas Yonge published a book called "Musica transalpina". It was a collection of Italian madrigals with words translated into English. Soon after this Morley started to publish his own madrigals. In 1592 he became a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal.

In London Morley lived near Shakespeare. We do not know whether the two men worked together, but Morley did set Shakespeare’s words "It was a lover and his lass" from "As You Like It". We do not know whether it was ever used in a performance of Shakespeare's play. It is quite possible, because Morley was well-known.

From 1593 onwards Morley published a great deal of music and also made a lot of money out of music publishing, both of his own and other composers’ music.

It is thought that Morley died in October 1602.

Morley wrote sacred music as well as madrigals. His church music is strongly influenced by William Byrd. 

His madrigals are his most important works. They are often very lively and have tunes that are easy to sing. One of his best known madrigals is called "Now is the Month of Maying". He started by using the Italian style and changed it to make it sound English. The madrigals of Thomas Weelkes and John Wilbye are usually more serious. 

As well as madrigals, Morley wrote music for instruments, including keyboard music. Some of his pieces are in the famous collection called "Fitzwilliam Virginal Book"). He also wrote music for the typically English combination of two viols, flute, lute, cittern and bandora.

Morley wrote a book about music theory called "Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke". It was published in 1597 and was read by many people for two centuries after his death. It tells us a lot about how music was performed in Morley’s

Hans Sebald Beham

Hans Sebald Beham (1500–1550) was a German printmaker who did his best work as an engraver. He also designed woodcuts, painted and worked as a miniaturist. He is one of the most important of the "Little Masters", a group of German artists making old master prints in the generation after Albrecht Dürer.

Beham was born in Nuremberg in 1500 into a family of artists. In 1525, he and his brother were banished from Nuremberg because they were thought to have not accepted the Churches ideas (heresy) and blasphemy. They came back to the city in 3 months, but Beham was banished again in 1528 for publishing a book which was plagiarised from an unpublished manuscript by Albrecht Dürer. 

From 1532 he lived mostly in Frankfurt until he died in 1550.

Most people know him as "Sebald Beham". However, he signed some of his prints before 1532 with "HSP". After he moved to Frankfurt, he signed his prints with "HSB".

Beham made about 252 engravings, 18 etchings and 1500 woodcuts. He worked on small, very detailed engravings (sometimes as small as a postage stamp). This makes him part of the German printmaking school called the "Little Masters", since their works were so small. He created and published his works himself, but his larger works were mostly commissioned work to be sold.

He also made prints to be used as cards, wallpaper, coats of arms, designs for other artists and designs for stained or painted glass. He also painted a table top (now in the Louvre ) for Cardinal Albrecht, Archbishop of Mainz.
Beham mostly engraved pictures of peasants and scenes from myths or history, sometimes with erotic scenes as well. Since he was working at the same time as Dürer, the most recognised artist at the time, one of his early woodcuts, "Head of Christ", was thought to have been done by Dürer. Beham also worked with his brother Barthel, and shared ideas with him. Later, he re-drew some of Dürer's works like gus Melancholia of 1539.

After publishing a book about drawing horses, for which he was exiled, he wrote a book on drawing the human figure. His book was mostly just a simplified book of Dürer's own books, but his book was easier to use and cheaper than Dürer's books, so artists preferred to buy his.

John Wilbye

John Wilbye (pronounce: “WIL-bee”), (born Diss, Norfolk, baptised 7 March 1574; died Colchester, between September and November 1638), was an English composer who was famous for his madrigals.

Wilbye was the son of a tanner. He was supported financially by a rich family called Kytson. The Kytsons were very musical and had lots of musical instruments and sheet music in their house. It is thought that he went with Elizabeth Cornwallis to Hengrave Hall near Bury St. Edmunds in around 1594 when she married Sir Thomas Kytson the Younger. When Elizabeth died, Wilbye moved to Colchester where he lived with Elizabeth’s youngest daughter with whom he had a long friendship. When Wilbye died he was quite rich.

A book of madrigals by him appeared in 1598 and a second in 1608. It is often called the finest book of English madrigals. There were a total of 64 madrigals in these two books.

Wilbye was influenced by Morley’s madrigals, and also learned directly from the madrigals of Italian composers such as Alfonso Ferrabosco. He wrote many madrigals which have become extremely popular, including "Weep, weep o mine eyes" and "Draw on, sweet night". He was very good at making his music match the meaning of the words. He often used a mixture of major and minor modes.

Thomas Weelkes was baptised in the little village church of Elsted in Sussex on 25 October, 1576. His father may have been the rector at that church. There is no information about Weelkes' childhood.

We know that in 1597 he published his first volume of madrigals, and that he was a young man then. After working for a short time at the house of Edward Darcye, he got the job of organist at Winchester College. He was paid 13s 4d (almost 67p in modern money) per quarter (i.e. every three months), but was given food and somewhere to live. He stayed there for two or three years. 

During his time in Winchester Weelkes composed two more volumes of madrigals, published in 1598 and 1600. He got his B. Mus. Degree from New College, Oxford in 1602, and moved to Chichester to take up the job of organist and choir master at the Cathedral.. He was also a lay clerk at the Cathedral, and was paid £15 2s 4d (£15.11 in modern money) in addition to having food and lodgings. The next year he married Elizabeth Sandham, who came from a rich family. They had three children.

Weelkes' fourth and final volume of madrigals, published in 1608, has a title page where he says that he was a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal. However, his name does not appear in the records at the Chapel Royal, so it is likely that he was only there for a short time until someone else was found for the job.

In later years Weelkes got into trouble with the Chichester Cathedral authorities because of his heavy drinking and bad behaviour. In 1609 he was in trouble because he was absent from work. In 1616 he was in trouble again for swearing. In the end he lost his job because he was drunk at the organ and used bad language during the service. However, he got his job back, but his behaviour was still bad.

Thomas Weelkes died in London in 1623, a year after his wife died. He was buried in St Bride’s Church, Fleet Street, London. In Chichester Cathedral there is a memorial stone to him.

Thomas Weelkes is best known for his vocal music, especially his madrigals and church music. Weelkes wrote more Anglican services than any other important composer of the time, mostly for evensong. Many of his anthems are verse anthems, which would have suited the small choir he was writing for at Chichester Cathedral.

Weelkes was friends with the madrigalist Thomas Morley. When Morley died in 1602, Weelkes wrote an anthem called "A Remembrance of my Friend Thomas Morley", (also known as "Death hath Deprived Me".) Weelkes’s madrigals are very chromatic and use counterpoint and unusual rhythms.

Teltow-Fläming

Teltow-Fläming is a "Kreis" (district) in the southwestern part of Brandenburg, Germany. The district was made in December 1993 by joining the old districts of Luckenwalde, Jüterbog and Zossen, but also including small parts from other former districts such as Luckau.

"Fläming-Skate" is a 160 km long route specially for inline skating, the only such route in Germany.

Curiously, the town of Teltow is not a part of the district Teltow-Fläming, just as the town of Dahme is not a part of the district of Dahme-Spreewald.

Black Knight

A black knight is a soldier or knight who either is not in service to a certain liege or does not want his liege, or himself, to be known and so does not have any heraldic standards or has painted them over with black paint. A good and well equipped soldier without a certain fealty was a wild card, or someone who you did not know what would happen, and a group of them could be a big problem for kings. Usually, a black knight is given a bad light, as a solider who has covered up his standards to not be found out where they came from.

In made up stories, black knights are usually evil knights that are good at fighting and usually work alone. A good example of this would be the Arthurian legend of the black knight.

Paladin

A paladin or paladine was a person with a lot of power in many countries during the medieval and in early modern Europe.

The word paladin was first used in Ancient Rome for a chamberlain of the Emperor, and also for the imperial palace guard, called the Scholae Palatinae by Constantine. In the early Middle Ages, the meaning changed and the word was used for one of the highest officials of the Catholic Church in the pope's service and also for one of the big nobles of the Holy Roman Empire, who was then named Count Palatine. The word paladin was also used in 19th century Hungary and in the German Empire and United Kingdom during the early 20th century.

In medieval literature, the paladins or Twelve Peers were known in the Matter of France as the retainers of Charlemagne. Because of the way that this word was used in books, paladin was then known to be a knight with honor. 

The paladins of the imperial guard were named after the Scholae Palatinae.

In the beginning, the word paladin was applied to the Chamberlains and to some soldiers guarding the palace of the Roman emperor. In Constantine's time, the word was also used for the best infantry of the army, the Praetorian Guard, that might guard the Roman Emperor during wars.

After the Middle Ages, the word palatine was put onto many different people of power across Europe. The most important of these was the "comes palatinus", the count palatine, who in Merovingian and Carolingian times, was an official of the lords' household and court of law. 

During the 800s, Carolingean rule came to an end and the title of Holy Roman emperor with it. About a century later, the title was made alive again by Otto I, though the new empire was now centered in Germany rather than France. The term palatine is found again under Charles IV, but they were less powerful than the previous palatines.

In the early days of England, the word "palatinate", or county palatine, was also used in counties of lords who could use powers normally used by the crown. 

In Britain and Germany, paladin was an official rank and was a very good title for one in the service of the emperors. It was a Knight with additional honours, they were allowed to use powers normally used by the crown.

The word "paladin" is still used to describe a good, heroic person, or a defender of a good cause. 

Some role playing games now use paladins as a character class that you can choose when starting a new game.

After a rash of vandalism that was very familiar, I ran a little check to confirm something. This turned into a large check to get to it all. Several socks of were discovered. Many of these were named after En:wp users. Other accounts which have been used for good editing were also a perfect match. All the accounts were centered on two seperate IPs and most crossed over from one to the other at some point. 

The main act of vandalism is centered around the topic "El Punyak" and recreating that page under as many different names as they can in a very short time. The page inaddition to a made-up subject also includes a large image which many people would consider pornographic or unsettling. 


With the exception of the one unblocked account and Alan Leifting (not blocked by me), I have left messages on the En:wp talk pages of those impersonated in case they somehow actually did create these accounts. -- 10:59, 15 January 2008 (UTC)


 is an account created by a self-identified 14 years old user. There are two matters we need to settle about such an account.

1. Do we want shared accounts at all

2. If we do, how are they to be set up? Informally, as this one has been, or by more formal contact with the school?

Anybody got any thoughts -- 19:58, 15 January 2008 (UTC)

One of the big pluses of this wikipedia is the lack of formal ways to do things; Things can be done in different ways, sometimes they are better done in a very specific way. I think, the idea behind having one "user" for a given project is to be easily able to identify which edits are from that specific user (As in; a group project building an article on ...). Personally, I think the same could be achieved by using the respective article's talk page. There it could be mentioned, that users foo, bar and baz from Parksdale School are involved in the creation of this article (as a community project). Perhaps a special tag could be designed to do that. Such a system would be good for both sides: On the one hand it is easy to see who vandalises, if there is vandalism (there does not need to be a "shared secret" password, on the other; it is easy to identify which edits come from the school.
In that way, "shared" accounts should be discouraged. -- () 12:57, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

I'm not sure if this should be posted here or on the Simple talk, but I have noticed a huge amount of vandalism as of late. This is a problem. As far as I know, back in December, the amount of vandalism was nowhere near what it is today. How can we better prevent a greater influx of vandalism? To me, it seems as though we've become a much bigger target for vandalism, and I think that it needs to be addressed. What could some solutions be to this? I urge all of the administrators to be on their guard, because this is troubling. 15:19, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

I also don't know where to post this, but since this involves administrators, then I will post it here. I have added a new rule under the articles section for articles that are not created in English. After a short discussion on Simple talk, I went ahead and added it to the articles section of as per the discussion on Simple talk. The code for it would be A5. Do you think that this is needed? 18:24, 16 January 2008 (UTC)

There are several IP's on there that are probably not used by the suspected scokpuppet anymore, I was wondering if we should delete them or... 03:35, 17 January 2008 (UTC)

This week's mainpage article on evolution had a very troubling lead, which was not supported by the source. I have rewritten the lead para, but cannot change the main page to reflect it. Update the mainpage or revert the lead in the article, it's all the same to me. I will make the observation, though, that I am surprised that article made to to gold star status. () 13:33, 17 January 2008 (UTC)

I know this issue has been repeatedly brought up every week, but I have seen Iamandrewrice's behavior go off the hook since many admins have been repeatedly frustrated about him. Initally, me and other users decided to give him a chance to become a productive editor, but I think that probably a mistake now (or regrets to several users). I have sent a few messages directed to him explaining about his behavior and to stop going on a wiki-mad rampage although it seems that he was overlooked them, just like he has done to the other admins/users. Tygrrr has before restricted his editing ability although it seemed fruitless (no offense Tygrrr:) ). I even tried to help him by pretending that he was "doing" a good job, so he would be moved to be a good editor, although that failed too; in other words I was using reverse-psychology.

So now I think the admins should decided wether to ban him or not. Because from what I have seen (from the sidelines), he seems to be disruptive, unproductive, harrassing, irritating, and up to a point unkind and selfish. He has also been given a lot of more chances than before and seems to be a nuissance to editors when it comes to write/edit articles in a productive and positive way. One of the things that kinda surpisies me his that he has been insulting admins and has still gotten away with a handful of those. From what I here in en wiki, such users would be blocked (maybe banned) for "harassement, personal attack, sock-puppet user, disruptive behavior," etc., from admins who are generally strict.

Right now, I think that he should be banned from wiki for being disruptive/annoying despite being warned repeatedly. I don't know what the admins think, but I have lost all of my sympathies to him to give him a chance to stay. Additionally, he should be banned for breaking numerous wiki policies repeatedly and evading his block(s) using IP proxies. By now, he should have learned his lesson, although he doesn't cares to improve his behavior. I think the admins who have all dealt with him should discuss on wether to ban him. Other than that, I hope that anyone who got stress from him will feel better and help to continue editing here. Peace to all;-))) -- 04:18, 19 January 2008 (UTC)

Obviously a returning vandal user, should suffice for a block I think, as per this and this.

Hey there, I think is a spambot. Can someone please confirm this? 16:39, 21 January 2008 (UTC)

Hello all,

I just wanted to inform you that I have blocked the IP (which is static), Ninja gaiden edited from for 6 months. As far as I can see there have been other problem users from that IP, As far as I can tell no regular (unblocked) users will be affected by this block. Account creation is disabled; the block is the result of a CheckUser. -- () 16:33, 22 January 2008 (UTC)

Greetings. I would like to change my username from its current name (Baccyak4h) to the very similar "Baccyak4H" (emph added for clarity only). This was the name I intended to sign up as, but I simply missed hitting the Shift key. I cannot register that name on account of similarity to my current name. Many thanks, and let me know what else I may need to do to help this process along. () 17:32, 22 January 2008 (UTC)

I propose a permanent ban on . Since his return from a week long ban he has edited some, mostly from ENWP.

Disruption and general edits to admin talk pages has been the main thrust of his "work". 

Today's disruption vandalism was at with the usual claims of "what have I done wrong" at .

I also propose action be taken against IuseRosary. Benniguy's willing aide to disruption. He claims to Rupert who edits from a school in Yorkshire, bit this is again shown to be patent nonsense.

Both users waste our time more than they enable contributions. I suggest a permanent ban for , and invite suggestions as to action to take about 

-- 17:45, 23 January 2008 (UTC)

I would like to apologise for being silly on Gwib's user page, I assure you that that was all we were doing, being silly. At first, we were just trying to get our school soft blocked, because I logged on today in geography and saw that an IP adess, or more were making a lot of vandilistic edits, and only creal was on and the IP adress/es were were working fast. I wanted to revert their edits and help, but I couldn't, but luckily it has all been returned to normol now :-). Yeah, so ben brought up the issue about getting the school soft blocked instead of hard blocked, but then when I joined into the conversation, then ben replkied, we got a bit silly and it was not our original intention, I promise. And, My edits are not directly from enWiki, well they are, but I do try to simplify them, i'm just not all that good at it. Block me if you see fit, but I can assure you that I will make sure I do not involve myself in sillyness again. I realise that that conversation on Gwib's page was not necessary/ or good in anyway and I should have just stopped after the first post, i'm sorry. Thank-You 18:41, 23 January 2008 (UTC)

This comment was left on my talk page by Benniguy. As he cannot edit here, I am going to post it here for him as his one "formal request" to not be banned. I think this is only fair since IuseRosary was allowed an apology to the community and a request to not be blocked. Without further ado...

· () 19:52, 24 January 2008 (UTC)

I think that if you do follow these suggestions, that this will be your sort of "last chance". I think one final chance is in order before a permanent ban. 20:18, 24 January 2008 (UTC)

The first suggestion is fine, but I think he should be allowed to respond to his talk page, and only his talk page. 20:56, 24 January 2008 (UTC)

The overwhelming response has been that User:Benniguy should be banned. I have blocked that Username indefinitly -- 22:14, 24 January 2008 (UTC)

I just wanted to ask why none of the official guidelines or policy pages are semi-protected. Shouldn't they be semi-protected in order to protect them from getting unwanted changes? Just a thought. 18:48, 23 January 2008 (UTC)

IC50

The IC is a measure of how effective a drug is. It indicates how much of a particular drug or other substance is needed to inhibit a given biological process (or component of a process, i.e. an enzyme, cell, cell receptor or microorganism) by half. In other words, it is the half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC) of a substance (50% IC, or IC). It is commonly used as a measure of antagonist drug potency in pharmacological research. Sometimes, it is also converted to the pIC scale (-log IC), in which higher values indicate exponentially greater potency. According to the FDA, IC represents the concentration of a drug that is required for 50% inhibition "in vitro".
It is comparable to an EC for agonist drugs. EC also represents the plasma concentration required for obtaining 50% of a maximum effect "in vivo".

Komitas Vardapet

Soghomon Gevorki Soghomonyan - Komitas Vardapet (also "Gomidas Vartabed") (September 26 1869 in Kütahya, Ottoman Empire - October 22 1935, Paris, France), was an Armenian priest, composer, choir leader, singer, music ethnologist, music teacher and musicologist, known as the founder of modern Armenian classical music. 

He was born into a family whose members were deeply involved in music and were monolingual in Turkish. His mother died when he was one and ten years later his father died. In 1895 he became a priest and obtained the title Vardapet (or Vartabed), meaning a "priest" or a "church scholar".

He established and conducted the monastery choir till 1896 when he went to Berlin, to the Kaiser Friedrich Wilhelm University. Here he studied music at the private conservatory of Prof. Richard Schmidt. In 1899 he acquired the title "doctor of musicology" and returned to Echmiadzin. He traveled extensively around the country, listening and recording details about Armenian folk songs and dances performed in various villages. This way he collected and published some 3000 songs, many of them adapted to choir singing.

His major work is Badarak (Divine Liturgy), still used today as one of the two most popular musical settings of the Armenian Church liturgy. 

He was the first non-European to be admitted into the International Music Society of which he was a co-founder.

On April 24, 1915, said to be the day when Armenian Genocide officially began, he was arrested. The next day he was put on a train with 180 other Armenian notables and sent to the city of Çankırı in northern Central Anatolia, at a distance of some 300 miles. His good friend, Turkish nationalist poet Emin Yurdakul, the authoress Halide Edip, and the U.S. ambassador Henry Morgenthau intervened with the government and, by special orders from Talat Pasha, Komitas was sent back to the capital. In autumn 1916, he was taken to a Turkish military hospital and he moved to Paris in 1919 where he died in a psychiatric clinic "Villejuif" in 1935. Next year his ashes were transferred to Yerevan and buried in the Pantheon. 
The Yerevan State Musical Conservatory is named after Komitas. There also a world famous string quartet named after Komitas.

Bradleys Head Fortification Complex

The Bradleys Head Fort is located not to far from Toronga Park Zoo. This fort was part of Sydney Harbour’s protection plan. It [the fort] remembers a time when the colony of New South Wales became more aware of its isolation and wealth. The fort can be found on Bradleys Head Road, Mosman, New South Wales, Australia.
They first started work to build the fort in 1840-42. It had a gun pit (special place for the cannon to sit and fire from) and firing wall (pictured in intro) that was built out of large blocks of sandstone and carved partly from the original rock that was already there. The first part of the building process around this time was done under the watchful eye of Major George Barney, a Commanding Royal Engineer who used hired workers provided by Governor Gipps.

In 1871 the fort got an extra barracks. The barracks were made from large sandstone blocks and carved out of the rock on the headland. This addition was the work of James Barnet, a colonial architect. This most recent add on had three gun pits and had connecting walkways for the people in the army that worked there. The upgrade of 1871 was complementary to some of the larger fortifications being constructed during the same period.
The site is now part of the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust.

Thousand Islands Bridge

The Thousand Islands Bridge is an international bridge that goes over the Saint Lawrence River. It connects the north part of New York in the United States with south east part of Ontario in Canada. It was made in 1937. Builders added parts in 1959. The bridge goes over the edge that Canada and United States share in the middle of the Thousand Islands area. It gets its name from the name of the area. The bridge is governed by the Thousand Island Bridge Authority, an agency that works around the world. 

The bridge is actually not a one bridge. It is really a lot of bridges that go across parts of the St. Lawrence River, eventually connecting both sides. The south end of the bridge connects with Interstate 81, an interstate. The north side of the bridge connects to Highway 137, a highway in Ontario. There is also an intersection with the Thousand Islands Parkway, a mini highway on the Ontario side.

Thousand Island Bridge Authority is doing a study to find out when the bridge will get to its working limits and how to make no waiting time on the bridge.

The international border is actually between Wellesley Island in the United States and Hill Island in Canada.

Siege of Orleans

The Siege of Orleans (1428 – 1429) was an important event in the Hundred Years' War between France and England. This Joan of Arc's first success and the first big success for the French since the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. 

The city of Orleans was at an important place on the river Loire. The English controlled large parts of France when they started the siege, and Orleans was the last thing stopping them from attacking the rest of France. There was not much south of the river to defend the people who served Charles VII of France, so the English came close to joining their northern lands in France with the land they controlled at Aquitaine.

The siege started on October 12, 1428 and its only major action until Joan of Arc arrived was the Battle of the Herrings. She initiated several attacks that ended the siege on May 8, 1429 - nine days after her arrival.

Metropolis (movie)

Metropolis is a silent science fiction movie created by the famed Austrian-German director Fritz Lang. It was produced in Germany in the Babelsberg Studios and released in 1927 during the height of the Weimar Republic. It was the most expensive silent movie of the time, costing approximately 7 million Reichsmark (equivalent to around $200 million in 2005) to make. 

The screenplay was written in 1924 by Lang and his wife, Thea von Harbou, and novelized by von Harbou in 1926. It is set in a futuristic urban dystopia and examines a common science fiction theme of the day: the social crisis between workers and owners in capitalism.

The movie is set in the year 2026, in the extraordinary Gothic skyscapers of a corporate city-state, the Metropolis of the title. Society has been divided into two rigid groups - one of planners or thinkers, who live high above the earth in luxury, and another of workers who live underground working to sustain the lives of the privileged. The city is run by Johhan 'Joh' Fredersen (Alfred Abel).

One of the workers, the beautiful Maria (Brigitte Helm), takes up the cause of the workers. The son of Frederson, Freder (Gustav Fröhlich), becomes infatuated with Maria, descends into the working underworld and, shocked at the working conditions, joins her cause. To counter the threat of worker dissatisfaction his father has The Robot built by the scientist Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge). The Robot is given Maria's appearance and is directed by Joh to spread disorder and so allow the workers to be crushed.

The movie climaxes with an attack on the upper world, foreshadowing the "destruction of the enemy in the citadel" ending still seen in movies. But through the intervention of Freder, Joh and the worker's leader are persuaded to reconcile their differences and work together - an anti-Communist gesture.

The movie features special effects and set design that still impress modern audiences. The effects expert was Eugen Schüfftan, who worked on the huge set.

According to Lang his inspiration for the settings of the Metropolis came during a trip to Manhattan, New York, New York, USA.

On January 10, 1927 the movie premiered in Berlin and a badly-edited version was released in the United States in March of that year. Following the bankruptcy of the moviemakers, the American print seems to be the only extant copy.

Several restored versions (all of them missing footage) were released in the 1980s and 1990s, running for around 90 minutes. A 147 minutes, digitally restored version was released in 2002 by the F.W. Murnau Foundation. It is believed that the original movie was over 210 minutes.

<doc id="92898" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92898" title="Mathematical proof">
Mathematical proof

A mathematical proof is a way to show that a math theorem is true. One must show that the theory is true in all cases.

There are different ways of proving a mathematical theorem.

One type of proof is called proof by induction. This is usually used to prove a theorem that is true for all numbers. There are 4 steps in a proof by induction.

1. State that the proof will be by induction, and state which variable will be used in the induction step.

2. Prove that the statement is true for some beginning case.

3. Assume that for some value "n" = "n" the statement is true and has all of the properties listed in the statement. This is called the induction step.

4. Show that the statement is true for the next value, "n"+1.

Once that is shown, then it means that for any value of "n" that is picked, the next one is true. Since it's true for some beginning case (usually "n"=1), then it's true for the next one ("n"=2). And since it's true for 2, it must be true for 3. And since it's true for 3, it must be true for 4, etc. Induction shows that it is always true, precisely because it's true for whatever comes after any given number.

An example of proof by induction:

Prove that for all natural numbers "n", 2(1+2+3+...+"n"-1+"n")="n"("n"+1)

Proof: First, the statement can be written "for all natural numbers "n", 2formula_1=n(n+1)

By induction on n,

First, for n=1, 2formula_2=2(1)=1(1+1), so this is true.

Next, assume that for some "n"="n" the statement is true. That is, 2formula_3 = n(n+1)

Then for "n"="n"+1, 2formula_4.

Getting "x" by itself gives

Reservoir Dogs

Reservoir Dogs is a 1992 movie. The movie was written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and starred Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, and Steve Buscemi. It is the first movie directed by Tarantino and is about the events before and after a jewellery shop robbery that went wrong. The movie was released on October 23, 1992. The title, and promo shots associated with the movie, was a take on the violent Sam Peckinpah movie, Straw Dogs. Although Reservoir Dogs failed at the theatre it found new life after being released on VHS and DVD, quickly becoming a cult classic. 

The movie shows the events before and after a robbery at a jewellery shop that went wrong. The men are given nicknames with colours so that they do not know each others names; Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), and Mr. White (Harvey Keitel). They work for a gangster Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) and his son, "Nice Guy" Eddie (Chris Penn). 

The robbery goes wrong and several of the men are killed, and Mr. Orange is shot and bleeding. The rest of the men return to the hideout and talk about what went wrong. Mr. Blonde has captured a police officer, Marvin Nash (Kirk Baltz) and beat him to try to get an answer. Mr. Blonde tries to torture the police officer while the rest of the men are away but is killed by Mr. Orange who is actually an undercover police officer. 

The rest of the men argue and are in a Mexican standoff and are all shot. Mr. Pink, who hid from the shootout, steals the diamonds and runs away.



At the movie's release at the Sundance Film Festival, movie critic Jami Bernard of the "New York Daily News" compared the effect of "Reservoir Dogs" to that of the 1895 movie "L'Arrivée d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat", where audiences watched a moving train approaching the camera and ran away frightened. Bernard claimed that "Reservoir Dogs" had a similar effect and people were not ready for it. Vincent Canby of the "New York Times" enjoyed the cast and the use of non-linear storytelling. He similarly complimented Tarantino's directing and liked the fact that he did not often use close-ups in the movie. Kenneth Turan of the "Los Angeles Times" also enjoyed the movie and the acting, particularly that of Buscemi, Tierney and Madsen, and said "Tarantino's palpable enthusiasm, his unapologetic passion for what he's created, reinvigorates this venerable plot and, mayhem aside, makes it involving for longer than you might suspect."

Roger Ebert was less enthusiastic; he felt that the script could have been better and said that the movie "feels like it's going to be terrific", but Tarantino's script does not have much curiosity about the characters. He also stated that "[Tarantino] has an idea, and trusts the idea to drive the plot." Ebert gave the movie two and a half stars out of four also claiming that he enjoyed it, and that it was a very good movie from a talented director, like other critics, he enjoyed the cast, but stated "I liked what I saw, but I wanted more".

"Reservoir Dogs" has received a lot of criticism for its strong violence and language. One particular scene that viewers did not like was Michael Madsen cutting off the police officer's ear, and Madsen himself reportedly had a great deal of difficulty finishing the scene especially after Kirk Baltz ad-libbed the desperate plea "I've got a little kid at home". Many people have left theaters during the movie and Tarantino commented at the time: 
It happens at every single screening. For some people the violence, or the rudeness of the language, is a mountain they can't climb. That's OK. It's not their cup of tea. But I am affecting them. I wanted that scene to be disturbing. During a screening of the movie at a Film Festival in Barcelona, fifteen people walked out, including horror movie director Wes Craven and special effects artist Rick Baker. Baker later told Tarantino to take the walk out as a "compliment" and explained that he found the violence unnerving because of its heightened sense of realism.

Critic John Hartl compared the ear-cutting scene to the shower murder scene in "Psycho" and Tarantino to David Lynch. He furthermore explored parallels between "Reservoir Dogs" and "Glengarry Glen Ross". After this movie, Tarantino was also compared to Martin Scorsese, Sam Peckinpah, John Singleton, Gus Van Sant, and Abel Ferrara. For its nonlinear storyline, "Reservoir Dogs" has also often been compared to "Rashomon". Critic James Berardinelli was of a similar opinion; he complimented both the cast and Tarantino's dialogue writing abilities. Hal Hinson of "The Washington Post" was also enthusiastic about the cast, complimenting the movie on its "deadpan sense of humor". Todd McCarthy called the movie "undeniably impressive" and was of the opinion that it was influenced by "Mean Streets", "Goodfellas" and "The Killing".

Bad Doberan is a district in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany.

In the Middle Ages the region was made rich because Hanseatic city of Rostock was close. Today the city of Rostock is surrounded by the district, but not a part of it.

In 1793 the bathing resort of Heiligendamm (today a borough of Bad Doberan) was started, and the region became a summer residence for the dukes of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.

In 1952 the districts of Bad Doberan and Rostock-Land were made. They were joined in 1994 to make the present district.

Variety show

A variety show is a television show that features a variety of performing acts. These may include actors, musicians and singers, , comedians, and other kinds of performers. Similar shows appeared earlier on radio, and were a newer kind of vaudeville.

Ed Sullivan hosted a long-running variety show on CBS, from the 1940s to the early 1970s. The Smothers Brothers hosted a comedy/variety show in the late 1960s. Other performers hosted successful variety shows through the years.

Variety shows were a good "breaking ground" for new acts, in the early years of television. They were also useful to established performers, to give them steady work and regular exposure to audiences.

Interest in the format lessened in the United States during the 1970s. Dolly Parton tried to start a new variety show in the 1980s, but it did not last. Performance competition shows, like "The Gong Show", "Star Search", and today "American Idol" became the new breaking ground for performers.

The variety show format is still sometimes imitated by comedy programs. Television talk shows carry much of the spirit of variety shows, in offering a variety of entertainers to appear.

Siegessäule

The or "Victory Column" is a famous sight in Berlin.

It was designed after 1864 to remember Prussia winning the Danish-Prussian war. By the time it was finished on 2 September 1873 Prussia had also beat Austria in the Austro-Prussian War (1866) and France in the Franco-Prussian War (1870/1871). A bronze sculpture of Victoria was added. "Victoria" was high and weighed 35 tonnes. Berliners like to give nicknames to famous buildings. They call the statue "Goldelse", meaning something like "Golden Lizzy". She also has the nickname of "Chick on a Stick".

The column was built in the Königsplatz, now the Platz der Republik, in front of the Reichstag building. It had three blocks of sandstone decorated by cannons taken from the enemies in the three wars. In 1938 the column was moved to its present location, and a fourth ring, decorated with golden garlands was added.

Around the base are four bronze reliefs showing the three wars and the winning army marchimng into Berlin. They were made by four Berlin sculptors:

These reliefs were taken away in 1945. The French occupying army did not want to remind Germans about old victories. French president François Mitterrand returned the reliefs in time for Berlin's 750th anniversary of Berlin.

The monument is now on the "Großer Stern" (Great Star). Many roads meet here, so there are four tunnels under the roads to the monument, and it is possible to climb the steps inside the column and look out over Berlin. If the Nazis had not moved the column it would probably have been destroyed in World War II.

The column is in Wim Wenders' film "Wings of Desire". In the film it is the place where angels meet. The golden statue on the column was in the music video to U2's "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" and inspired Paul van Dyk's 1998 trance music hit, "For an Angel".

"El Ángel" in Mexico City looks a lot like the Berlin victory column.

The Victory Column is open every day: April-October 9:30am-6:30pm November-March 9:30am-5:30pm.

Church music

Church music is music that is intended to be part of Christian worship in churches, chapels, cathedrals or anywhere Christians meet to worship. Church music is sacred (religious) music, but not all religious music is church music. Some music may be inspired by religion, but it may not be church music. For example, some songs are about religion, but they may not be church music. Although it uses the words of the Requiem mass, Verdi’s "Requiem", was composed for performance in a concert hall. Britten’s "War Requiem" was written for performance in a cathedral, but it was not meant to be part of a service of worship, so it would not usually be thought of as “church music”.

Church music has varied enormously during the history of Christianity as different churches kept changing their ideas about what part music should have in religious worship. Most church music is based on singing. Music written for church choirs mostly used the words of the liturgy (the words used in services). The organ is the most important musical instrument in church music, although from time to time many other instruments have been used as well.

During many periods in history composers writing for the church used traditional music rather than the newest fashions. This was particularly the case in the early 17th century when composers such as Claudio Monteverdi often wrote in two different styles: the old style for church music (which, at the time, they called “stilo antico”) and the new style for secular (non-religious) music (which they called “stilo moderno”).

During the early history of Christian worship the churches were spread through many countries in the Roman Empire. The musical traditions that already existed in these countries were used, so there was great variety. Musical instruments were associated with the devil and with dancing, and so they were thought to be wicked and were not allowed in churches. The only music that was allowed in churches was singing. In the 4th century Bishop Ambrosius of Milan introduced the antiphon and encouraged newly composed hymns. Psalms were an important part of the early Christian worship. Responsorial psalms were psalms which were sung by one person (who may have been called a “reader”), and the congregation may have responded at the end of a verse with something simple such as “Alleluia”. Gradually “antiphonal psalmody” was developed. This meant that the choir stands on opposite sides facing one another and they sing the verses of the psalm alternately (first one side has a turn, then the other). Antiphonal psalm singing can still be heard today in Anglican cathedrals.

The kind of music heard in the Catholic church was known as chant or plainchant, often known as “Gregorian chant” (after St Gregory the Great, who was Pope from 590-604). The text (the words that were sung) were the standard words of the liturgy. The words of the Mass were set to music by many composers. Music for the dead was called Requiem Mass. There was also music for Vespers and the Compline. Until the 16th century the organ was only used to accompany the singing. In the Renaissance period many great composers such as Giovanni da Palestrina and Orlande de Lassus wrote polyphonic music for the Catholic church. They often wrote motets: short pieces based on texts which were not part of the liturgy.

During the period called Reformation some Protestant groups broke away from the Catholic Church. From this time on Catholic and Protestant music developed in different ways.

Martin Luther started the Protestant movement in Germany. In the Lutheran church the chorale was the most important part of the musical worship. Luther himself composed many chorale tunes. These are like hymns. The great Johann Sebastian Bach based much of his organ music on the chorale (these pieces are called Chorale Preludes). The choir often sang a motet. Sometimes these choir pieces became very long and turned into cantatas. The words were not from the liturgy but made up by poets or taken from the Bible. Bach wrote about 200 cantatas for the church. He also wrote two great passions which tell the story of Jesus dying on the cross. Other composers who have contributed to Protestant church music in Europe include Heinrich Schütz, Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, Dietrich Buxtehude, Johann Pachelbel, and Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy.

Music for the Catholic church includes instrumental music such as “church cantatas”. Arcangelo Corelli and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote many examples of these. Mozart also wrote several masses. Great Italian composers of the 16th and 17th centuries who wrote church music include Giovanni Gabrieli and Claudio Monteverdi. In the 19th century Rheinberger and Max Reger wrote music in the Romantic style. French composers of this time wrote in a style which was similar to music.

When King Henry VIII broke away from the Catholic Church he founded his own church, known as the Anglican church. Many great composers wrote music for the Anglican service. Their music for choirs was mostly service settings and anthems. They also wrote many hymn tunes. Important composers include William Byrd (who also wrote Catholic church music) and Thomas Tallis in the Renaissance, Orlando Gibbons and Henry Purcell in the Baroque period, and in later periods Samuel Sebastian Wesley, Charles Stanford, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Edward Bairstow, William Mathias and John Rutter.

Church music in American churches developed, at first, in a similar way to European music. The Book of Common Prayer was the basis of American worship. Both Puritans and Baptists thought that congregational singing was important. In the 18th century Singing Masters from Singing Schools in the north eastern states used to travel around to try to teach people in church to sing properly. The most famous of these singing masters was William Billings. Because most people could not read, a system called Lined-out Hymnody developed, in which the priest sang a line and the congregation copied him. Later in the century, during the “First Great Awakening”, the hymn tunes of English composers such as Isaac Watts and Charles Wesley became popular.

In the 19th century people from different churches met at Camp Meetings. These were led by Evangelists. The songs reflect the belief that sinners can be saved by . The music of black people and of folk music became important influences. Songs became tuneful and often had refrains. In the middle of the century Sunday Schools for children became extremely popular and many songs were written for them. Gospel songs and negro spirituals also became very widely used and influenced the development of church music in America.

Church music in the Orthodox Church in East European countries is always sung. It is based on the Byzantine musical tradition.

Independencia is bordered to the north by the Elías Piña and Bahoruco provinces, to the east by Barahona and to the south by the Pedernales province. To the west Independencia borders the Republic of Haiti.

Independencia has a total area of 2,006.44 km². It has 4.1% of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 8th (out of 31 plus the National District) largest province.

There are six municipalities and six municipal districts in the province.

The municipalities and their municipal districts (M.D.) are:

In 2002 (last national census), there were 50,833 people living in the Independencia province, and 31,729 (62.42%) living in towns and cities. The population density was 25.3 persons/km², the second lowest in the country; only Pedernales has a lower population density.

The largest city is Duvergé, with a population (in 2002) of 17,320 inhabitants. It is the only province in the Dominican Republic where the capital city is not the largest city of the province; Jimaní has a population of 11,414.

The Sierra de Bahoruco is found in the southern part of the province, and the Sierra de Neiba runs across the northwestern part of the province, on the border with the Elías Piña province. The rest of the province is part of the "Hoya de Enriquillo" (or "Neiba Valley"). In this valley is the "Lake Enriquillo", and about half of its area is part of the Independencia province.

There are few permanent rivers, with water all the time. The longest river is the Las Damas river (24 km), which flows from Sierra de Bahoruco to the Lake Enriquillo.

The climate of the province is a tropical climate, very hot and dry in the valley, but it is cooler on the mountains.

As in all border provinces in the Dominican Republic, there is little economic development. The trade with Haiti is important in Jimaní, which is not far from Port-au-Prince. On the Sierra de Neiba, coffee and beans are important products.

Digital divide

Digital Divide is the name of the gap, in a branch of technology, between parts of the world where technologies as internet, mobile phones, computers, wi-fi there are, and the parts of the world where there are not. 

A Digital Divide can born for many reasons like socioeconomic problems (few people are rich and lots are poor), racial problems (there is a majority or a minority that control the other), or geographical problems (in the cities there are technologies but there are not in rural areas). 

An example of Digital Divide we can see if we think about countries as Canada, the United States, Japan, South Korea, Western Europe and North Europe and Australasia,where there are big internet connection developments, or where technologies are cheaps, and after we think about Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia,where there are many social problems and where technologies has a long way before to get interest in those countries, for problems as, price of technology, and sometimes because there is not resources for help it. The Digital Divide is a big problem for the world, because it help others problems, and probability the richer parts of the world will be always be the richest, and the poorer parts,will always be the poorest.

In some parts of world there is a large Digital divide. Sometimes it is just in half of a country, or just a region, for example Africa. There are big cities where technologies are really cheap and there are lots of villages and rural communities where there is no technology. In this case the Digital Divide creates others problems. Because a part of the country is rich and another part is poor there are often problems with trading and connections.

Many rich countries (for example, Canada, United States, Japan, Italy, France, United Kingdom) send old computers or make charity projects by no-profit associations or communities or projects for the school in poor countries, as One Laptop Per Child, to fight the digital divide and to make a culture involving internet and other technologies.

Duck Hunt

Duck Hunt is a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) game system. The game was made by Nintendo, and was released in 1984 in Japan. In "Duck Hunt", players use the NES Zapper to shoot ducks on screen to get points. The ducks come onto the screen one or two at a time, and the player is given three shots to shoot them down. 

"Duck Hunt" was one of the two first Pack-in games for the NES. The game did not get many reviews, but many gamers enjoyed playing it, and many people said it was a good game. Before Nintendo made the game, it also made a "Duck Hunt" game about the Laser Clay Shooting System released in 1976.

In "Duck Hunt", players use the Nintendo Zapper Light Gun that must be plugged into their NES consoles. Then they try to shoot down ducks or clay pigeons. "Duck Hunt" was also released as an arcade game in 1984, and was also in the PlayChoice-10 arcade console.

The game has three modes: one-duck mode, with only one duck on the screen; two-duck mode, with two on the screen; and a third mode called "clay pigeon shooting". The clay pigeons are much smaller than the ducks and are harder to hit. Players need faster reaction time when playing this mode than when shooting ducks. In "Vs. Duck Hunt", Clay Shooting mode is the second mode after two-duck mode, because the arcade "Duck Hunt" games never had a one-duck mode. 

During the game, there is a dog that laughs at the player if no duck is hit. If the player hits a duck, the dog will congratulate them. A popular urban legend is that players have found a way to shoot the dog. This cannot happen in "Duck Hunt", but it can happen in a bonus round of the arcade game "Vs. Duck Hunt". 

"Duck Hunt" does not have a way for more than one person to shoot ducks, but a second player may plug in a NES controller in the other controller port and control the duck that appears. This only can happen in one-duck mode, and can not be done with the clay pigeons.

Nobody knows much about the development of "Duck Hunt", but Nintendo Research & Development 1 made the game. They also created the Light Gun used in "Duck Hunt". Work on the game was led by Takehiro Izushi, and was produced by Gunpei Yokoi. 

"Duck Hunt" has been placed in several cartridges with more than one game. In the Action Set cartridge of the NES in the 1980s, "Duck Hunt" came with "Super Mario Bros.". If a player bought the NES system with the Power Pad, then "Duck Hunt" came on a 3-in-1 cartridge that also had "World Class Track Meet" and "Super Mario Bros".

The music was composed, or written, by Koji Kondo and Hirokazu "Hip" Tanaka. Both men made music for other Nintendo games at the time, such as Metroid. Some people have called the sound effects, "pretty much what you'd expect for a game from the early 1980s - that is, awful by today's standards...", but the game's music was played on the Video Games Live concert tour.

Because it was made in the 1980's, "Duck Hunt" did not get very many reviews. Most critics have not reviewed "Duck Hunt". All Game Guide called the game an "attractive but repetitive target shooter" and "utterly mindless ... the game is fun for a short time, but gets old after a few rounds of play." Video Game Critic, another website, gave the game a review in 2004, scoring the game a "D". It said, "there's really not much substance to it ... overall Duck Hunt is pretty lame, and only worth playing for a trip down memory lane." Video game players say that they like the game. IGN users gave it an 8.7 out of 10, and the Gamespot users gave the Mario-Duck Hunt cartridge a 9.1 out of 10. It was rated the 155th best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Powers Top 200 Games list.

"Duck Hunt", and the characters in it, have been in other video games since the game first came out in the 1980s. The dog in "Duck Hunt" has appeared in "Barker Bill's Trick Shooting" and can be shot in the "Balloon Saloon" game. In "Super Smash Bros. Melee", a trophy shows the ducks from "Duck Hunt". Also, games in the "WarioWare, Inc." series have games about "Duck Hunt". Level 19 in Tetris DS is also about "Duck Hunt"

One of the games in "Wii Play" for the Wii console is Shooting, a game that is similar to "Duck Hunt". The game replaces the light gun used in the NES game with the Wii controller, and it has a targeting reticle that "Duck Hunt" did not have. The new game also has different things to shoot, such as UFOs and targets, and has a two player mode.

Hybrid Theory

Hybrid Theory is the first studio album by Linkin Park. It was released on March 25, 2001.

Before Linkin Park was known as "Linkin Park," they were known as Xero. After Mark Wakefield left Xero, Chester Bennington joined, and their name was changed to "Hybrid Theory." They produced a demo tape with nine songs and sent it to several record companies, but they all refused to sponsor Linkin Park. Eventually, they were signed by Warner Bros. Records in 2000.

Most of the songs on "Hybrid Theory" came from early versions of them that Xero recorded with Mark Wakefield.

The songs were mostly about Chester Bennington's problems as a child, such as child abuse, social isolation, the divorce of his parents, and drug abuse. Bennington and Mike Shinoda have said that the songs turned into songs about "everyday emotions that you talk about and think about."

In 2002, all of the songs were remixed for Linkin Park's second album, "Reanimation".


Four of the songs from "Hybrid Theory" were released as singles: "One Step Closer," "Crawling," "Papercut," and "In the End." They were all very popular and appeared on charts. "Runaway" was not a single, but it also appeared on charts.

Critics had mixed opinions of "Hybrid Theory". The magazines "Rolling Stone", "PopMatters", "The Village Voice" and "Sputnikmusic" liked the album. Robert Christgau from "The Village Voice" enjoyed listening to "Papercut" and "Points of Authority."

However, "Allmusic" and "NME" did not like the album. They thought it was a generic rock and heavy metal album, and not very creative.

Hybrid Theory EP

Hybrid Theory EP is an EP by the American nu metal/alternative rock band Linkin Park that was recorded and released in 1999. At this time, Linkin Park were called "Hybrid Theory", making this EP a self-titled album, or an album named after the band.

It was Linkin Park's first record. Before it, in 1997, the band only made a demo tape called "Xero". The band changed its name later in 1999, after Chester Bennington replaced Mark Wakefield as the lead singer.

Only one thousand were made, and the EP was sent to different record labels, such as Warner Bros. Records. The rest of the copies of the EP were sent to the first members of Linkin Park's fan club.

On November 19, 2001, Linkin Park Underground, Linkin Park's fan club, was made. The first fan club package that was sent to members had a new edition of "Hybrid Theory EP", with a note from the band. The first 500 copies of the CD were signed by all 6 members of the band.

The only ways to get the EP are to buy it from eBay, or win a contest in the Linkin Park Underground when the EP is awarded as a contest prize. But the prizes awarded by the LPU are the original EP.

<doc id="93292" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=93292" title="San José de Ocoa Province">
San José de Ocoa Province

San José de Ocoa is a Dominican province; it is located on the southern side of the Cordillera Central. Its capital city has the same name, San José de Ocoa.

It was created on 6 September 2000 but it started on 1 January 2001. It was a municipality of the Peravia province before being raised to the category of province.

San José de Ocoa is bordered to the north by the Monseñor Nouel and La Vega provinces, to the east by San Cristóbal, to the south by the Peravia, and to the west by Azua.

The province is named after its capital city, San José de Ocoa. "Ocoa" is the name of the river that crosses the province; it is a Taíno word that means "a place with many mountains".

Bartolomé de Las Casas was the first person that wrote about the region when he said that "Maniey" (now, "Maniel") was a Taíno province. Maniey or Maniel meant "a place where there are peanuts"; mani (Spanish, "maní") is the Taíno word for peanut. Peter Martyr d'Anghiera did not write about the "Maniey" but he wrote about a lake in the region of Rancho Arriba; there is not a lake (or lakes) there anymore, only a swamp.

For a long time, the region was visited only by "monteros" (men that hunted wild cows and pigs). Then some "maroons" (runaway slaves) came to live here, in the high mountains of the region. One settlement was called "Maniel"; since then, Maniel meant in Hispaniola a place where maroons live and not only the name of the region. 

The first settlement by maroons in the region is from the beginning of the 16th century and was called Maniel Viejo de Ocoa. This settlement lasted until 1666 or 1667 because many people died from smallpox and measles that affected the island in those years. There was also a military action in the region to capture maroons.

The second settlement was during the first years of the 19th century (around 1802), and it is known as Maniel de los Lorenzos ("Lorenzos' Maniel") because of the last name ("Lorenzo") of its founders. It was founded at El Canal, north of the city of San José de Ocoa.

Very soon some families from Baní, on the south, began to move to the region and made their houses at what is now the city of San José de Ocoa.

On December 1858, San José de Ocoa was made a municipality of the old province of Santo Domingo; in 1895, it was changed to a municipality of the Azua province. With the creation of the Peravia, San José de Ocoa was a municipality of that new province. Then, on 6 September 2000, San José de Ocoa was made a new province.

During the Independence War (1844), there were two important battles in the region: the battles of El Memiso and El Pinar, won by Dominican soldiers. So the Haitian soldiers could not go on to Santo Domingo, and had to go back to Haiti.

San José de Ocoa has a total area of 855.40 km. It has 1.8% of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 25th (out of 31 plus the National District) largest province.

There are three municipalities and four municipal districts in the province.

The municipalities and their municipal districts (M.D.) are:

In 2002 (last national census), there were 62,368 people living in the San José de Ocoa province, and 32,920 (52.78%) living in towns and cities. The population density was 72.9 persons/km.

The main economic activity of the province is agriculture; the main products are coffee, beans and potatoes. Other vegetables, such as cabbage and carrots, are also grown as well as some tropical fruits (avocado and mango).

The Land Before Time

The Land Before Time is a 1988 movie produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, and directed by Don Bluth. It was released on November 18, 1988, the same day as Disney's "Oliver & Company". The movie's success led to 12 sequels being made.

An orphaned long-neck dinosaur named Littlefoot goes off in search of the legendary Great Valley, a place with lots of vegetation where dinosaurs can live in peace. Along the way he meets four other young dinosaurs, each one a different species, and they encounter several problems as they learn to work together in order to survive.

There are five main characters known as the "Gang of Five:"

Littlefoot: The leader of the gang, Littlefoot is a "long-neck," the in-universe name for Apatosaurus. He is brave, and good at making decisions. He lives with his grandparents in the Great Valley.

Cera: Cera is a "three-horn," also known as a Triceratops. She is stubborn and does not trust easily. She is the most aggressive of the group. She lives with her father for most of the movies, but gains a new mother in the 11th movie and a younger sister in the 12th movie.

Ducky: Ducky has been called a "Swimmer," "Big Mouth," and "Duckfoot" on screen, so it is not known for sure what kind of dinosaur Ducky is. She looks most like a Saurolophus, but she is called a Parasaurolophus on the Land Before Time Website . She is the nicest of the group, and trusts others easily. She lives with her mother and father (though her father is not often seen) and is one of thirteen twins. She also has her adopted brother Spike.

Petrie: A "flyer," or a Pteranodon, Petrie gets scared very easily and is too trusting, but he is loyal and can be brave at important times. He lives with his mother and brothers.

Spike: Spike is the youngest of the group. He is a "Spiketail," which is a Stegosaurus. Spike does not talk, though it was shown in the 4th movie that he can when he wants to. He enjoys eating and lets Ducky sit on his back if she needs to. Ducky is his older sister, since she adopted him during the first movie. He lives with Ducky's family.

Also of note is a "Sharptooth" named Chomper, who was born in the 2nd movie and was so popular with fans that he returned in the 5th movie and the TV series. He is friends with all the main characters, despite his natural instincts telling him to eat them.


There are rumors that "The Land Before Time XIV" (2010) will be made.

In addition to the movies, there is "The Land Before Time: Sing-Along Songs" (1997) and 
"The Land Before Time: More Sing-Along Songs" (1999)

After the success of the original movie and its sequels, a television series based on the movies began airing on YTV in Canada as a test on January 5, 2007. It aired in Canada, Britain, and the United States of America, and had 26 episodes. It then aired on Cartoon Network in the United States on March 5, 2007 where it was animated after the DVD release of "The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers". In the UK, it was once shown just on Boomerang, showing every day at 4pm, but it is now programmed on its sister preschool channel Cartoonito. It brought back Chomper as a main character, and introduced a new friend, an Oviraptor named Ruby, who helps the other dinosaurs learn lessons and solve problems.

<doc id="93385" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=93385" title="The Gong Show">
The Gong Show

The Gong Show is an American television game show, that was produced in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was created and hosted by Chuck Barris. The show's name came from a used to shorten performances that were not liked. The gong was sounded by celebrity judges, who rated the performers.

In the mid-1970s, Barris hoped to make a new kind of game show, based on the old "amateur hour" contest shows. He held auditions to find talented acts to appear. Nearly all the performers who came to the auditions were ordinary people, who had one or two skills, or thought they had special talent. Many of the performances were "", that people did to amuse others. Others were more serious, and tried hard to perform well.

Most of the acts made Barris and his staff laugh. They thought their idea for a show would not work, because of the strange and funny performances. Barris then realized that audiences might want to watch them for amusement. He and his staff began to look for funny and unusual acts. The show debuted in 1976, and became a hit.

Two versions of "The Gong Show" aired at first: A nighttime version, hosted by Gary Owens, and a daytime version, hosted by Barris himself. Barris later took over the nighttime version also. Each version worked the same, but featured different judges and performers. A live band played music for the performances. Live audiences attended each show, and cheered on the acts they liked. When they did not like an act, they would call on the judges to "Gong 'em!" If a judge sounded the gong, the act had to stop, and lost their chance for a prize. The performer who rated highest with the judges won a cash prize. (The "prize" was mostly for show; all the performers were paid the same, whether they won or not.)

Many celebrities served as judges on the show, including Jaye P. Morgan and Jamie Farr. One well-known comedian, Murray Langston, performed on the show with a paper bag over his head. He called himself the "Unknown Comic", and told simple jokes when he appeared onstage. Langston won his round, and was invited back to appear other times. Many people wondered who the Unknown Comic really was. Langston later admitted he had appeared on the show just for some quick cash, because he needed money. He hid his identity so his performance would not hurt his comedy career, since he was already well-known.

No real stars were made by "Gong Show" appearances, but thousands of people got a chance to perform on national television, and others got the chance to watch. One popular member of the show's cast was "Gene, Gene, the Dancing Machine", who would dance in front of the show's band between acts. Barris himself was also well-liked by the audience. He treated all the performers on the show kindly and seriously, and hosted the show like it was a party.

Many of the acts who auditioned for "The Gong Show" were not suitable for television, or for times when children or families might watch. Some of these acts appeared in a movie, which was released in 1980.

In time, new and unusual acts became hard to find, as more people performed on "The Gong Show". The television audience also lost interest. Barris was tired from working on the show. "The Gong Show" was cancelled by 1982. Reruns came later, but they also stopped with time.

Today, "The Gong Show" is remembered fondly by the people who watched it. Amateur talent contests still sometimes feature a gong, for when an act does not go over well. (They are rarely used.)

Barris wrote a , titled "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind", that talked about his time on the show.

Early in his career, Barris tried songwriting. One of his songs, "Palisades Park", was a hit record for Freddy Cannon, a popular singer.

Barris got his start in television as a page and later staffer at NBC in New York, and eventually worked backstage at the TV music show "American Bandstand".

Barris was promoted to the daytime programming division at ABC in Los Angeles and was put in charge of deciding which game shows ABC would air. Barris admitted to his bosses that the producer/packagers' pitches of game show concepts were worse than Barris' own ideas. They suggested that he quit his ABC programming job and become a producer himself.

Barris first became successful during 1965 with his first game show creation "The Dating Game" on ABC. The next year Barris began "The Newlywed Game".

He went on to create several other short-lived games for ABC in the 1960s and for syndication in the 1970s, all of which revolved around a common theme: the game play normally derived its interest (and oftentimes, humor) from the excitement, vulnerability, embarrassment, or anger of female contestants or participants in the game. 

Barris became a public figure in a big way in 1976, when he produced - and served as the host of - the talent contest spoof "The Gong Show", which he packaged in partnership with TV producer Chris Bearde. The show's cult stature far outstripped the two years it spent on NBC (1976-78) and the four years it ran in syndication (1976-1980).

After "The Gong Show" went off the air, Barris kept a lower , but still worked in television. In the 1980s, he published a , "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind". Barris claimed in the book to have been a CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) agent and assassin, who regretted his earlier life. He also regretted making "" television shows, that to poor taste. It was republished in the 1990s.

Many people believe "Confessions" does not tell a true story. Others are not sure if it is fact or fiction. Some, including celebrities who knew Barris, do not know or care, and enjoy his stories as entertainment. The CIA itself denies Barris ever worked for them.

George Clooney made "Confessions" into a movie, starring Sam Rockwell, Drew Barrymore and Julia Roberts.

<doc id="93455" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=93455" title="Caligula">
Caligula

Caligula (Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, 31 August AD 12 – 24 January AD 41), was the third Roman Emperor. He reigned from AD 37, and was assassinated after less than four years by members of his bodyguard and the Roman Senate. He was popular with the Roman public in his time, but his reign saw the slaughter of many innocent people without fair trials. 

Caligula's father Germanicus, the nephew and adopted son of emperor Tiberius, was a very successful general and one of Rome's most beloved public figures. 

When Germanicus died at Antioch in 19 AD, his mother Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with her six children where she became entangled in a bitter feud with Tiberius. This conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family, with Caligula as the sole male survivor. Unscathed by the deadly intrigues, Caligula accepted the invitation to join the emperor on the island of Capri in 31, where Tiberius himself had withdrawn five years earlier. At the death of Tiberius in 37, Caligula succeeded his great-uncle and adoptive grandfather.

There are few surviving sources on Caligula's reign, although he is described as a noble and moderate ruler during the first two years of his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, extravagance, and sexual perversity, presenting him as an insane tyrant. 

Caligula worked to increase the authority of the emperor. He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself. However, he started the construction of two new aqueducts in Rome: the "Aqua Claudia" and the "Anio Novus". During his reign, the empire annexed the Kingdom of Mauretania and made it into a province.

In early 41, Caligula was assassinated as the result of a conspiracy involving officers of the Praetorian Guard, as well as members of the Roman Senate and of the imperial court. The conspirators' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the Roman Republic was thwarted, as the same day the Praetorian Guard declared Caligula's uncle Claudius emperor in his place.

Surviving sources present a number of stories about Caligula that illustrate cruelty and insanity. He has been accused of killing for mere amusement, committing incest with his sisters and prostituting them with other men, and turning the palace into a brothel. 

He appeared in public dressed as various gods, and demanded to be worshipped as a god. He made his horse, Incitatus, a Senator and citizen of Rome, a consul and a priest.

The history of Caligula's reign is a problem. Only two sources contemporary with Caligula have survived — the works of Philo and Seneca, and they give mostly anecdotes. At one time, there were detailed contemporary histories on Caligula, but they are now lost. Caligula's sister, Agrippina the Younger, wrote an autobiography which certainly included a detailed explanation of Caligula's reign, but it too is lost. No surviving source paints Caligula in a favorable light, but the question of whether or not Caligula was insane remains unanswered.

Jacques Arcadelt (also called Jacob Arcadelt) (born probably in Liège, 1504 or 1505; died Paris, 14 October 1568) was a Franco-Flemish composer in the Renaissance period. He was an extremely popular composer of madrigals and chansons. 

We know hardly anything about his early life, but we know he was living in Rome by 1539 whe was made a member of the Julian Chapel. Soon he joined the Sistine Chapel, where he had the job of "magister puerorum" (director of the boys choir), and later he became choirmaster. In the same year he published four of his total of six books of madrigals for four voices. Probably around 1553 he moved to France, where he spent the rest of his life. He wrote a very large number of chansons (French songs). He also wrote some masses.

Arcadelt's music became extremely popular because it was quite simple and easy to sing with beautiful melodies that people could remember. One very famous madrigal is called "Il bianco e dolce cigno" ("The white and gentle swan"). The style of Arcadelt’s music influenced the next generation of madrigal composers.

Electronic organ

An electronic organ is a keyboard instrument that works with electricity. It has developed today into two kinds of instrument:

Some electronic organs (digital organs) are made to look and sound like pipe organs. They can be used in churches and other buildings. They have some advantages over real pipe organs: they can be moved about easily, they do not go out of tune, they do not take up a lot of room (only the console and some loudspeakers are needed), and they are cheaper. They also have many computerised features which can be useful. The problems are that many people think they do not sound as good as pipe organs, and many organists think they do not feel as good to play as a traditional, mechanical pipe-organ.

The other kind of electronic organ is the one found in many homes today. It is based on the Hammond-type organ. The pedals are straight. It is used for jazz or popular music. Many have lots of different tone generators and synthesis modules which can imitate hundreds of instruments.

The current Madison Square Garden opened in 1968. It is located at 4 Penn Plaza, close to the intersection of 8th Avenue & 33rd Street in Manhattan, New York City.

The arena has six sections of seats. One of them is not open if hockey is played. The other sections used to have different colors. There were red, orange, yellow, brown and blue seats. However, the fans of the New York Rangers only wanted to sit in the blue seats. They did not want to use any of the other sections. They even did not let other fans use the blue seats. For this reason, the MSG does not use these colors today. The most active fans sit in the section 400.

The number of people who can visit the arena changes. If hockey is played, 18,200 people may be there. That is because people can not sit in the first section. 19,763 people is the capacity of MSG if basketball is played. Up to 20,000 people may watch a concert in the arena.

Often he was not able to rule the country because of mental illness and his wife Queen Isabeau of Bavaria ruled with the help of his brother Louis I de Valois, Duke of Orléans.

If we take the first option (a community decision would be nice), I think that the mere extent of this would justify a Wikiproject. This has become too big to be the work of less than 6-8 people. The general work on world history I have are two books, each of about 1500 pages. -- () 21:48, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

If this article is to become a good article, then these articles would need to be created. 

I hope this helps you on your quest to have this article become a good article. Cheers! 16:47, 3 March 2008 (UTC)

This article, a previous VGA nominee, was denied because of multiple redlinks. This has been fixed, and I think this article is probably VGA-worthy, but have decided to nominate it here first. -- () 20:30, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

It was previously a VGA. After the VGA rules changed and GA rules were introduced, it was demoted to the level of regular article because of its size. It is now more than 4KB (-->readability.py?page=Proxy_server&lang=simple&family=wikipedia link) applying the conditions on the 2nd requirement for GAs. It meets all of the other requirements (although item 6 is met in a more or less lame way). - 19:45, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

I have worked quite hard on this article over the past few days. I think that it definately meets the criteria for a GA, if not a VGA. I think it is a great article. 09:25, 19 February 2008 (UTC)


This article does have some good points to it, though:


Clean up these things by the time that this proposal is up for voting, and I am sure that people will be fine voting in support of it becoming a good article. Good luck! 20:41, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

This failed the recent GA vote only because we were short one support vote. It had 100% support, but it only had 4 support votes. This article should definitely be a GA because it meeets all the requirements. Let's try to get this one to pass again! 16:01, 18 February 2008 (UTC)

(unindent) I think this article still needs a few things to be ready:
If I find the time, I will also work on it.-- () 13:13, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

I know that I'm trying to abstain from intervering (i don't know how to spell that) with the VGA/GA process(es), but I think this article could become a GA after the red links are filled in. -- 06:47, 16 February 2008 (UTC)

I think this article is good and ready for GA status. -- () 03:51, 16 February 2008 (UTC)

I'm bothered by the capitalization of "vocabulary" words that don't need to be capitalized. There are probably 20-30+ 50+ words that are unnecessarily capitalized. I also think the amount of new vocabulary to anyone who isn't practically an expert on organs makes the article kind of confusing. I don't know what, if anything, can be done about that though. · 21:19, 12 February 2008 (UTC)






IMO far too many important red links. -- 20:20, 9 February 2008 (UTC)
















I just found out that those in the Isalm tepmlate are also in Muhammad (which is currenlty a VGA). Therefore fixing those should have a higher priority. -- () 22:22, 10 February 2008 (UTC)








The second issue is the killer as it shows the article is not in Simple English which for me is the first and main requirement to be made. While there are always going to be times where it just may not be possible to be entirely in keeping with Simple English, every attempt should be made to do so and this article lacks that in many areas. This article really needs a full peer review before it will be ready for nomination. -- 08:43, 15 January 2008 (UTC)

OneRepublic's song "Apologize" was listed on Timbaland's 2007 release "Shock Value". The song was released as the single in its original form on the band's debut album Dreaming Out Loud. In addition the single is almost double platinum (marking two million copies sold in the U.S.) It peaked at number three on the U.K. Official Top 40 Week on November 11, 2007.

The band performed "Apologize" live on Fox's "So You Think You Can Dance" on August 2, 2007. In October 2007, they performed "Apologize" on an episode of "One Life to Live", along with Timbaland. It was also played at the end of the television show "Cold Case" episode "Sabotage".

Lead guitar means the use of a guitar to perform melody lines, instrumental fills, and solos within a song structure.

In rock and metal bands, the lead guitarist is usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar (chords and ). In some rock or metal bands with two guitarists, the two performers may perform as a "guitar tandem", and trade off the lead guitar and rhythm guitar roles, or both guitarists can play the same role ("dual lead guitars" or "dual rhythm guitars").

Musician Lou Reed used an "interlocking" dual guitar style, with the Velvet Underground and on his solo records, where two guitarists would play riffs in different rhythms. The Eagles and other bands also used this style.

Coburg is a rural district in Upper Franconia in north Bavaria, Germany.

The history of the district is largely influenced by the city of Coburg. From 1826 to 1918, the region was part of the small duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. After World War I, the Coburg portion of this state decided to join Bavaria. The present district is identical to that portion, but excludes the city of Coburg and the exclave of Königsberg, which is part of Haßberge district. The city of Neustadt was a district-free city until 1972 and was then made part of the district.

The district is located in the hilly country between the Thuringian Slate Mountains and the Main valley.

The arms consist of the blue and white checkered pattern of Bavaria and the arms of the Wettin dynasty of Saxony. These arms represent the historic affiliations to both states.

Trautmann is in Germany nearly unknown and had never played in the national team of his country. But in Manchester, he's until today one of the most popular player.

Bert Trautmann was born at October 22 in 1923. He began playing football at age 10, when he was 18 he had to go to do his military service for the German Nazi-Regime. The paratrooper was first imprisoned by the Sowiet, later by the British army. He did not left the island after his shank and became a professional football player.

After some years he went to Manchester City. In the first time, the fans hate the "Nazi boy". But after the 1956 FA Cup final, the fans accept Trautmann as a good player for their team. At the 75th minute of this game, Trautmann was hit by a player from Birmingham. The crash broke his neck, but Trautmann finished the game. Today it's often called a medical miracle that Trautmann did not die at this day.

Just a few days after the game his five years old son died in a car crash. In 1950 he had married the first time, in 1990 again. In the year 2004 he was honored by Queen Elizabeth II.

Stone Temple Pilots (often called STP) is an American rock band that played in the 1990s and early 2000s. They broke up in 2003 but reformed in 2008. The band has Scott Weiland (vocals), brothers Robert (bass guitar, vocals) and Dean DeLeo (guitar), and Eric Kretz (drums, percussion). The band's five albums have sold more than 17.5 million in the United States alone and more than 30 million albums worldwide. The band had fifteen top ten singles, or songs sold on their own, on the Billboard rock charts, including six #1's, and one #1 album on the pop charts (1994's "Purple"). In 1994, the band won a Grammy for "Best Hard Rock Performance" for their song "Plush". Stone Temple Pilots were also ranked at #40 by VH1 on the 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock list. 

The band released the greatest-hits album "Thank You" in 2003. The band then fell apart. Since the band's end, Weiland moved on to become the frontman of Velvet Revolver with former members of Guns N' Roses. The DeLeo brothers started the band Army of Anyone with Richard Patrick from the band Filter. Army of Anyone released its first album in 2006, which was also called "Army of Anyone". Kretz started Bomb Shelter Studios in Los Angeles. 

In 2008, Stone Temple Pilots reformed. They went on a concert tour that began on May 1 and ended on October 30. In a short time, they will return to the studio to record a seventh album.

Scott Weiland and Robert DeLeo met during a concert. They formed a band with two of Scott's friends from Edison High School, Corey Hicock (guitar) and David Allen (drums). They then named their band "Mighty Joe Young" and recorded a demo tape that was completed around 1990. During the recording, they got a call from their lawyer who told them that there was a blues man who had already claimed the name Mighty Joe Young. They changed the band's name to Shirley Temple's Pussy and performed under this name for a short time, but then changed the name again due to record label pressure. They decided to use the initials STP and soon used the name Stone Temple Pilots in 1992.

Urinal deodorizer blocks are the small disinfectant blocks found in urinals. There are many other words for them, such as: "piss biscuit", "urinal cake", "urinal mint", or "urinal puck".

The blocks are used to kill germs and take away the bad smell of urinals in public bathrooms. They are put over the urinal drain and evaporate very slowly. Because they do not dissolve or break apart in water, they do not take away the smell of the flushing water or urine. Different blocks are made with different chemicals, like paradichlorobenzene or naphthalene. The block is something scented to smell like different things, such as cherries.

New York Philharmonic

The New York Philharmonic is the oldest symphony orchestra in the United States which still exists, and one of the most famous orchestras of the world. It performs most of its concerts at the Avery Fisher Hall in New York.

The orchestra started in 1842. At that time it was called the Philharmonic Society. At its first concert the orchestra played a very long programme which included Beethoven’s "Symphony No. 5" conducted by Ureli Corelli Hill. The musicians worked as a cooperative or "communistic" society. This meant that the musicians themselves made up the rules about how the orchestra should be run: who would become a member, which music would be performed, and who would conduct. At the end of each season they divided any money the orchestra had earned amongst themselves.

The orchestra were a great success, but they needed a new concert hall. They gave a fund-raising concert which included Beethoven's "Symphony No. 9". It was the first time it had ever been played in America. The concert took place in Castle Garden on the southern tip of Manhattan. There were about 400 performers in the orchestra and choir. The words that the choir sings were translated into English. It was the first time this work had been sung in English anywhere in the world. However, the tickets cost a lot of money: US$2.00 each, so not so many people came. It was some time before the orchestra got their concert hall. Many people thought Beethoven's 9th symphony was a strange piece of music because the choir only sing in the last movement which is called "Ode to Joy". In 1865 Theodore Eisfeld conducted the Orchestra’s memorial concert for the recently assassinated Abraham Lincoln, but the last movement was not performed because it was thought that the "Ode to Joy" was not suitable for the sad occasion.

Leopold Damrosch, who had been Franz Liszt's concertmaster at Weimar, was the orchestra’s conductor for the 1876-1877 season. But the public did not like him, so he started his own orchestra: the Symphony Society of New York. When he died in 1885, his 23-year-old son Walter Johannes Damrosch took over and continued the competition with the old Philharmonic. It was Walter who would make the rich Scotsman Andrew Carnegie realize that New York needed a really good concert hall and on May 5, 1891 both Walter and the Russian composer Tchaikovsky conducted at the first concert of the city's new Music Hall. A few years later this new hall was renamed Carnegie Hall after the man who gave the money for it to be built.

Theodore Thomas began conducting the Philharmonic in 1877 and made it a very good orchestra. In 1891 Thomas left New York to found the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

Anton Seidl conducted the orchestra until 1898. Seidl had worked as Wagner's assistant and was famous for conducting Wagner’s music. He gave the first performance of Antonín Dvořák's Ninth Symphony "From the New World." Many people were sad when Seidl suddenly died in 1898 from food poisoning at the age of 47. Twelve thousand people applied for tickets to his funeral at the Metropolitan Opera House at 39th Street and Broadway and the streets were jammed with people and traffic.

In 1909 the orchestra was organized differently. Instead of a cooperative, they were run by a small group of people called . They persuaded Gustav Mahler to be principal conductor. Instead of 18 concerts a season they gave 54, which included a tour of New England. Mahler was used to conducting opera, but now he could conduct symphonies, and he introduced audiences to his own compositions. During his time the orchestra were given regular salaries for the first time.

Between 1911 and 1920, the Philharmonic's conductor was Josef Stransky, who led every single one of the orchestra's concerts during this period.

When the Philharmonic joined together with the National Symphony in 1921, they had the Dutch conductor Willem Mengelberg. He stayed there for nine years, although other conductors, including Bruno Walter, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Igor Stravinsky, and Arturo Toscanini, led about half the concerts. They started to have an outdoor symphony series, playing low-priced summer concerts at Lewisohn Stadium in upper Manhattan. In 1920 the orchestra hired Henry Hadley as "associate conductor" to perform concerts which included works by American composers.

In 1924, the Young People's Concerts were started, and soon grew to 15 concerts per season by the end of the 1920s. They started to make recordings. In 1928 they joined together with another orchestra, the New York Symphony Society. Toscanini conducted the newly organized orchestra, and continued until 1936.
The English conductor John Barbirolli and the Pole Artur Rodzinski, were joint replacements for Toscanini in 1936. The next year Barbirolli was made the main conductor, a post he held until the spring of 1941. In 1943, Rodzinski became conductor. He had also been conducting on the Sunday afternoon radio broadcast when CBS listeners around the country heard the announcer break in on Arthur Rubinstein's performance of Brahms's Second Piano Concerto to tell them about the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Artur Rodzinski, Bruno Walter, and Sir Thomas Beecham made a series of recordings with the Philharmonic for Columbia Records during the 1940s.

Leopold Stokowski and Dimitri Mitropoulos were the orchestra’s two conductors in 1949, with Mitropoulos becoming conductor in 1951. Mitropoulos often conducted new music and music that was not well known. In 1957, Mitropoulos and Leonard Bernstein served together as Principal Conductors until, in the course of the season, Bernstein was made conductor, becoming the first American-born-and-trained conductor of the Philharmonic.

Leonard Bernstein was Music Director for 11 seasons. Many new things happened during this time. Two television series were started on CBS: the "Young People's Concerts" and "Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic." The first of these started in 1958. It was a new idea and it won every award for educational television. Bernstein continued the orchestra's recordings with Columbia Records until he retired as music director in 1969. He got lots of composers, especially American composers such as Aaron Copland, to write new works for the orchestra.
In 1971 Pierre Boulez became the first Frenchman to have the job of conductor of the Philharmonic. Boulez had new ideas about music to be performed. He was a composer himself and often performed modern music.

Zubin Mehta became conductor in 1978. He, too, conducted a lot of new music. 
Kurt Masur, who had often been conducting the Philharmonic since 1981, became conductor in 1991. During his time he included a series of free Memorial Day Concerts at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and annual concert tours abroad that included the orchestra's first trip to mainland China. His stayed until 2002, and was then given the honorary title “Music Director Emeritus of the Philharmonic”.

On 26 February 2008 the Philharmonic gave a concert in Pyongyang in North Korea. It was the first time since the end of the Korean War in 1953 that there had been an important cultural visit from the United States to North Korea .

In September 2002, 60 years after conducting the Orchestra at the age of twelve at Lewisohn Stadium, Lorin Maazel became conductor of the Philharmonic. In his first subscription week he conducted the first ever performance of John Adams' "On the Transmigration of Souls". This work had been composed in memory of those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. He performed new music as well as music of the well-known composers. He will stay with the orchestra until the end of the 2008-2009 season.

Lake Enriquillo

Lake Enriquillo is a lake in western Dominican Republic, near the border with Haiti. Its Taíno name was "Hagueygagon" but, in colonial times, it had the name "Jaragua Lake". 
It is in the "Hoya de Enriquillo" valley, a long valley between the "Sierra de Neiba", to the north, and the "Sierra de Bahoruco", to the south.

The lake has an area of 265 km², and its surface is around 44 meters below sea level, the lowest point in the Caribbean. There are three small islands in the lake: Isla Cabritos, Barbarita, and La Islita.

Only small rivers flow into the lake. The rivers that flow from the Sierra de Neiba always have water. Those rivers that flow from the Sierra de Bahoruco sometimes do not have water.

It is a salt water lake with a higher concentration of salt than the sea water because the rivers that flow into the lake are small and the evaporation of its water is high.

Many water birds visit the lake to feed, including flamingos. There are also American crocodiles and some fishes as tilapia. Because it is an arid region, the vegetation around the lake is poor with cacti and small shrubs.

The lake is part of the "Lago Enriquillo e Isla Cabritos National Park" and of the "Jaragua - Bahoruco - Enriquillo Biosphere Reserve".

The main cities on the coast (or very near) of the lake are:

The Battle of Patay (18 June 1429) was an important battle in the Hundred Years' War between the French and the English in north-central France. The French won and the English lost badly. Many men in the English longbow corps died. Many English leaders of the battle were killed or taken prisoner. This battle changed the course of the war and made the French more powerful. Joan of Arc gets credit for the victory, but most of the fighting happened when the very first men reached the field, before most of the army had arrived.

Battle of Crécy

The Battle of Crécy happened on 26 August 1346 near Crécy in northern France, and was one of the most important battles of the Hundred Years' War. The smaller English army won against the much larger French army. New tactics and weapons make this an important battle in the history of warfare because the English used longbows to win against French knights. The longbow was a faster weapon to fire than the French and Genoan crossbow and could send arrows farther than the crossbow could and could send an arrow through a suit of armour. Before this battle during the Middle Ages, knights had been the most important part of an army. Because of this change some historians call this battle the beginning of the end of chivalry.

In the battle, the French knights, protected by chainmail reinforced with metal plate, were nearly exhausted by charging several miles into the battle (against their king's wishes). Their horses had to to walk through deep mud and charge up a hill into English and Welsh arrow storm. They were cut down. Many French nobles died.
The knights' horses were barely protected at all. The storm of arrows killed or disabled the knights' mounts, and left the knights floundering in the mud on foot beneath a hail of arrows.

The bolts (heavy arrows) of the hired Genoese crossbowmen at the forefront of the battle could not reach the English. They fell short because the crossbow strings were wet. The archers had also misjudged the range and shot too early and too low. The English, controlling the high ground, were able to run a short distance down the hill and pick off the Genoese with volleys of arrows. As the Genoese attempted to retreat, they were cut down by the French knights, who thought the withdrawal was cowardly. This wasted the first charge of French cavalry, and left them disorganized for the charge on the English.

In a strong defensive position, Edward III ordered that everyone fight on foot. He split the army in three divisions, one commanded by his sixteen-year-old son, Edward, the Black Prince. The archers were set in a 'V-formation' along the top of the hill. While they waited, the English built a system of ditches, pits and caltrops, to hurt and bring down the enemy cavalry.

Arthur Schlesinger Jr

Arthur Meier Schlesinger, Jr., born Arthur Bancroft Schlesinger (October 15, 1917 – February 28, 2007), was a American historian and social critic. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. His work explored the liberalism of American political leaders, especially that of Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, and Robert F. Kennedy. He served as Special Assistant and Court Historian to the President in John F. Kennedy's administration. He wrote a lot about the Kennedy administration. These writings have the title "A Thousand Days". 

When the United States thought about invading Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, he was one of only two people who opposed the invasion. The other was William Fulbright. Schlesinger sat silent, except for a private memorandum to the president. He did this, because he did not want to undermine the President's desire for a unanimous decision. 

When it had become clear the invasion had failed, Schlesinger later wrote: "In the months after the Bay of Pigs, I bitterly reproached myself for having kept so silent during those crucial discussions in the cabinet room ... I can only explain my failure to do more than raise a few timid questions by reporting that one's impulse to blow the whistle on this nonsense was simply undone by the circumstances of the discussion."

Schlesinger contributed many things to liberal theory. He was mostly for the kind of liberalism Kennedy did. He was admired for his wit, scholarship, and devotion to delineating the history and nature of liberalism. Since 1990 he had been a critic of multiculturalism.

He popularized the term "imperial presidency" during the Nixon administration by writing the book "The Imperial Presidency".

I think that these would be very helpful in many parts of the website where we do voting, more specifically, the , , , , and pages. I am suggesting that these two templates be transwikied or added to the Simple English Wikipedia for use in the aformentioned pages. What do other people say about this idea? 20:25, 15 February 2008 (UTC)

Nobody has a say about this? 02:05, 16 February 2008 (UTC)

I support this idea. The template surely looks better. How about a template for Neutral also? ( ▪ ) 09:31, 16 February 2008 (UTC)

Kamikaze and Jimi Hendrix haven't been discussed about what will happen to them. I would like to propose that since just by looking at both of the pages makes me believe that they are indeed VGA's, that we put both of them back up for voting to see if the articles still make it under the new criteria for VGA's. Any other ideas? 21:17, 15 February 2008 (UTC)

Both are at the lower limit of the about 5k; despite this, I think they should keep their tag



If the community agrees that the subtropical cyclone complex tag is not really needed, we can discuss about its future as a GA; we can also discuss about extending the delay for fixing for a few days, if work is apparent on the resp. articles.

So the ball is up to the community. -- () 09:56, 17 February 2008 (UTC)

This date will be linked; in our case, this mostly produces ugly red links. Using the monthname day, year; or day monthname, year format; with the components linked produces an extra set of braces (<nowiki>..</nowiki>). I think we have the following options here:

(unindenting) I have no idea about the academic background of our editors or readers; As to the languages, we are still pretty Europe-centric. This means most of our editors have English, a Latin-based (French, Spanish, Italian...), a Germanic (German, Dutch, ..), or a Slavic (Russian-derived) language as their first language; there may be some with Arabic as their first language; that is for the high yield contributors. As to the "prototype user": He or she has some knowledge about something, but for whatever reason prefers to use the Simpler English over the more complex EnWP. I am aware that a (possibly uneducated) Thai or Korean (who has not even learnt his mother tongue well) will face other issues here than a Brazillian who has learnt Spanish before he had a go at English.

Please have a look at the guideline, recent changes include:

This also means that we can start the promotion process for good articles. We still need to go over all the VGAs, and identify which of them do not meet the current VGA standard. Which would mean the two week delay for fixing VGAs to again meet the standard would start now for the ten already discovered.

Someone mentioned a tool that could print out nice statistics about articles; it would be worth mentioning that again, so it can be added to the proposed demotions page. -- () 08:46, 9 February 2008 (UTC)

Hello All...
I have recenlty put Moulin Rouge! up to be a GA.

Since the demotion process has now also been unfrozen, I want to add a few comments about it:

Now demoting such an article is a matter of minutes (replace a tag); I would however rather go for another procedure:

For this reason, please think twice before you support a VGA being demoted, rather than spending 10 minures fixing what is amiss. -- () 20:50, 9 February 2008 (UTC)

I was on the login page a moment ago, and wondered whether the phrase "Create an account" was simple enough. Couldn't it be "Make an account" or "Get an account?" We already have "Talk" instead of "Discuss," and "Change" instead of "Edit." Just a thought. () 02:09, 10 February 2008 (UTC)

I think that we should stick the 'create' I have just looked up the words for 'create', 'get' and 'make' in most major european languages as well as some major non -european language. From this, I have noticed that our word, 'create' is much closer to their words for create than the corrolation between our and their words for 'get' and 'make'. So, Keeping it as 'create' will make it easier for foreign people to understand rather than 'make' or get' 15:09, 10 February 2008 (UTC)


You're right - "get" is a little misleading. I think that "make" is better, though - it would probably be learned before the word "create." I've been learning Japanese and Russian, and I have learned the word "make" in both languages, but "create" still eludes me. () 21:36, 12 February 2008 (UTC)

Frankly I find registered users a fairer game. Anons you have to remember and they lie and the whole blah-blah-blah. Because in my view, registered users, who are much more helpful just get a userpage, a nice little name and the power to move. Even some users per example like don't have userpages.

Megiddo () is a hill in Israel. It is near the modern settlement of Megiddo, known for theological, historical and geographical reasons. 

In ancient times, Megiddo was an important city state. It is also known alternatively as Tel Megiddo (Hebrew) and Tell al-Mutesellim (Arabic). According to some interpretations of the Christian Bible, this will be the place for Armageddon (that derives from the name's place in Hebrew) or the final battle between the forces of light led by Jesus Christ and the forces of darkness led by Satan or the Anti-Christ after the End of Days.

It works because its many parts are either on the front or the back end, which are linked by a steel hinge. It is manufactured by Corner Shot Holdings, LLC, a company in Miami with offices in Israel. Units have been sold in 15 countries. The CornerShot was recently evaluated by the UK Ministry of Defence.

The CornerShot is available in several different types. A standard pistol version is available, along with a 40 mm grenade launcher. Because they are fitted with really good digital cameras, any type can also be used as a tool to spy with. All the models come with the same camera and 2.5 in. color LCD screen, providing video and sighting system with transmission capability. The flashlight and camera let it work in either day or night. A variety, or group of different types, of cameras, as well as a folding stock, are available, and an accessory rail is standard. 

The standard CornerShot can put a normal semi-automatic pistol in the front part of the weapon, with a remote linkage to the trigger mechanism in the rear part, it has a trigger pull of 21 newtons (4.7 lbf). It is 820 millimetres (32.67 in) long, with a weight of 3.86 kilograms (8.5 lb).

The 40 mm Grenade Launcher is a breech-loading, single shot grenade launcher. Manually operated, or it can only fire one at a time, it fires all 40 mm grenades, less-deadly and non-deadly ammunition (or what a gun fires), and tear/irritant gas capsules (the container in a liquid or gas is stored); spent ammunition is ejected for easier reloading. The same system is available in 37 mm size for police. The 40 mm model has a rifling of 1:1.224, is 900 mm long, and weighs 4.4 kg (9.5 lb). The muzzle velocity, or velocity when it comes out of the gun is 74.7 m/s (M-406 grenade). Its range for normal fire, single target is 150 meters; and for area coverage, with fragmentation munitions, or ammunition that blows apart when it hits its target, is 350 meters.

The Assault Pistol Rifle mounts an assault pistol in the front part of the weapon to allow the use of rifle bullets. It fires 5.56 mm ammunition. The APR pistol can be removed from the CornerShot frame.

First shown at the Eurosatory 2004 military trade show in Paris, based on the system for use against armored vehicles is designed to fire Panzerfaust anti-tank rockets. It can turn 90 degrees instead of the standard 60 degrees.

In the standard version a pistol is mounted in the front end of the weapon, which bends horizontally (like a door does) at a mid-gun sixty-degree hinge. There is a digital camera and a flashlight attached to the barrel in the bayonet position. On the butt side of the hinge are the trigger, camera screen (which is on a horizontal hinge just like the mid-gun hinge but it is off of the left side of the gun), and controls for the camera and light.

The Krummlauf was a bent barrel designed for the Sturmgewehr 44, which was used by the Germans in World War II. It allowed for looking and firing around corners with its 30 degree barrel and a periscope-style sight.

Local government of Germany

There are five levels of government in Germany. The local government means the lowest two levels. The levels are all legally independent political levels. This means that each level has a job to do in running the country, and is recognised in the German constitution, the Grundgesetz. The levels can only be reorganised if they agree and if it does not give too much power to a higher level.

The five levels are:

Some states have "regierungsbezirke" which are a group of counties and cities in an area to help run certain tasks across the area.

Other states have "Amt" which is a collection of municipalities in a district usually because the municipalities themselves are too small to run many services

Regierungsbezirke and Ämte are not guaranteed by the constitution, they are a way of helping the various levels of government to do their job.

The idea of subsidiarity means that government jobs should be done by the lowest possible level.

There are two types of tasks (jobs) for a municipality. "Voluntary" which a town or municipality can do if it wants, and "mandatory" or things which must be done because of a federal or state law.

Setting up a theatre, a museum, a sports field or a meeting hall is a voluntary task. If the municipality can afford to set these things up, the "Land" cannot stop them. Also the "Land" cannot order the municiaplity to set these things up.

The mandatory self-government tasks are things which a municipality must do itself, or must arrange to be done on its behalf. For example one of the most important jobs of any local council is to providing the citizens with water, electricity, district heating, gas as well as wastewater services and waste removal.

A council could run its own waterworks or join with others to share a larger facility. Modern electricity supply means that a council does not have to run their own power station anymore. But they must help private companies get the electricity supply to local houses and factories.

Although the Federation or state might have the right to control some things, the idea of subsidiarity means that they are "administered" (carried out) at the lowest possible level. For example marriage ceremonies and issuing birth and death certificates are arranged by the town registrar, the Federation and the Land arrange legal and expert supervision so that the task is done properly and is the same across Germany.

Other transferred tasks include:


Who runs the town or district government depends on where in Germany the town is.

The town council, or town council meeting is responsible for all jobs not given to the "magistrat". The magistrat is the executive responsible for administering services. It is chosen by the town council, and can have both professional and honorary members. The mayor is head of the magistrat, but not of the town council meeting. The mayor is chosen separately by the people not the council. the system is only used in Hesse. It is the oldest system, and the only system where a group of elected people are responsible for the administration, instead of just one, the mayor.

The mayor is head of the council and the administration.

Power is split between the Mayor and the town clerk. The Mayor has some functions, but day to day administration is done by the professional town clerk.

Used in Bavaria and the old eastern länder. The mayor is elected by the people, and he heads the council and the town government. The council is responsible for nearly all decisions. Some deision are taken by the mayor. The council can give some its tasks to the mayor, but in that case they cannot change the mayor's decision.

Mendelian inheritance

Mendelian inheritance is a set of rules about genetic inheritance. 
The basic rules of genetics were first discovered by a monk named Gregor Mendel in the 1850s, and published in 1866. For thousands of years, people had noticed how traits are inherited from parents to their children. However, Mendel's work was different because he did experiments on plants, and designed those experiments very carefully. 

In his experiments, Mendel studied how traits were passed on in pea plants. He started his crosses with plants that bred true, and counted characters that were either/or in nature (either "tall" or "short"). He bred large numbers of plants, and expressed his results numerically. He used test crosses to reveal the presence and proportion of recessive characters.

Mendel's laws apply widely, but not to all living things. They apply to any organism which is diploid (has two paired sets of chromosomes) and which engages in sexual reproduction. They would not apply to bacteria, for example, or to asexual reproduction. They do apply to the great majority of plants and animals.

Mendel explained the results of his experiment using two scientific laws:


Mendel's laws explained the results he got with his pea plants. Later, geneticists discovered that his laws were also true for other living things, even humans. Mendel's findings from his work on the garden pea plants helped to establish the field of genetics. His contributions were not limited to the basic rules that he discovered. Mendel's care towards controlling experiment conditions along with his attention to his numerical results set a standard for future experiments. Over the years, scientists have changed and improved Mendel's ideas. However, the science of genetics would not be possible today without the early work of Gregor Mendel.

It is formed at Beattyville, Kentucky, which is in Lee County, which is where the North and South Forks come together.

The river is formed in eastern Kentucky at Beattyville, in Lee County, when the North, Middle and South Forks meet at about 670 feet (204 m). The river flows generally northwest, and is highly meandering in the mountains. It then flows through Daniel Boone National Forest, then past Irvine and Boonesborough, then southwest, passing south of Lexington, then north through Frankfort. It joins the Ohio at Carrollton.

Approximately 15 mi (25 km) southwest of Boonesborough it is joined by the Red River. About 20 mi (30 km) southwest of Boonesborough it is joined by Silver Creek. At High Bridge, it is joined by the Dix River. At Frankfort, it is joined by Benson Creek. 10 mi north of Frankfort, Elkhorn Creek flows into the river.

Between Clays Ferry in Madison County and Frankfort, the river passes through the Kentucky River Palisades. The latter is a series of steep gorges approximately 100 mi (160 km) in length.

According to Robert F. Collins of the United States Forest Service, Dr. Thomas Walker named the river, in 1750, Louisa River, after Princess Louisa, the wife of Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland.

Maurizio Giuliano

Maurizio Giuliano (born 1975) is a person from Italy and England, who travels a lot, writes books, and writes in newspapers. In 2004 he was in the Guinness Book of World Records as the youngest person who has been to all the countries in the world. In 2006/2007 he worked for the UN.

Maurizio Giuliano was born on 24 February 1975 in Milan, Italy, with a lawyer as a father and a housewife as a mother. He lived in Cuba, Chile, and Indonesia, among other countries. As of 2004, he knew eight languages according to one source, while another source specified that he "spoke" five and had a "passion" for two more.

He went to school in Milan and Manchester, and then studied at the University of Oxford in 1996
and the University of Cambridge in 1997.
to know about Oxford's inter-disciplinary course in "Philosophy, Politics, and Economics" (PPE), especially Latin America and eastern Europe. 

As of 1998, he was a research fellow at the Centre for Social Studies (CESOC) in Santiago, Chile.

He wrote two books and some articles on Cuban politics, especially on the US embargo (which usually stops Americans from doing business with Cubans), which he thinks (in the book ""La Transición Cubana y el "Bloqueo" Norteamericano"" and other works) is not good.

In an article published in the British academic journal "Democratization" in 1998, he focused in particular on how the US embargo against Cuba helps create "empathy" by third parties towards Cuba, so that Cubans think it is support for Cuba's government. So he argued that the US Government – in addition to the embargo's direct influence on supporting Cuba's regime – indirectly interferes with the possibility of improving Cuba. That is because third countries, foreign non-governmental organizations and prominent individuals lend support to Cuba's resistance to the US embargo, and this offsets external pressures for democracy, thereby allowing the Cuban regime to convert such "empathy" into a source of legitimacy at home.

His scholarly work on internal Cuban politics, notably on the 1996 purge of Havana's Centre for American Studies (CEA) (contained in the book ""El Caso CEA"" published in 1998), has been the object of academic reviews, as it exposed the internal conflicts between Cuba's political apparatus and the country's intelligentsia (most intelligent people), previously unknown.
According to some reviews, the book, a work of investigative journalism helped by academic analysis, dealt a strong blow to hard-liners within the regime,
by exposing for the first time the internal conflicts between Cuba's apparatus and its intelligentsia.
In 2001, Cuban exiled scholars Alberto Álvarez and Gerardo González, who were among those purged from the CEA, wrote the book ""¿ Intelectuales vs. Revolución ? El caso del Centro de Estudios sobre América"", which strongly built upon Giuliano's book to offer further insights on relations between Cuba's political apparatus and the country's intellectuals.

Besides work on Cuba, other countries Giuliano covered in his journalistic work include East Timor and Myanmar (formerly known as Burma).

In 2000, he visited North Korea and published an essay about his visit, essentially describing his tour around the country as being like a movie made by the North Korean authorities.

In his journalistic work, he reportedly ran into problems with the authorities of at least two countries. In 1998, he was denied entry to Myanmar after making contact with the National League for Democracy and taking photos of its leader Aung San Suu Kyi. And on 30 October 2002, he was reportedly detained and manhandled by Israeli authorities while crossing the Allenby Bridge.

Giuliano's writings have also included lighter topics. During his time in Kabul, for example, he wrote restaurant reviews for a local English-language magazine.
In the early 2000s, Giuliano was a consultant for the Italian Senate's Committee on Human Rights. At that time, at least some of his writings were also intended to influence the positions of the Italian Government on certain human rights issues, as was the case with material that he wrote on North Korea.

In 2004, Giuliano worked for the International Organization for Migration in the elections for Afghan refugees in Pakistan,
and in 2005 worked in Afghanistan for the United Nations Development Programme.
In both cases, he was working in the field of communications with the media.

Between 2006 and 2008, he served with the United Nations, again in the field of media relations, in the Central African Republic,
Sudan,
Chad,
and Cameroon following the refugee crisis caused by the battle of N'Djamena of February 2008.
According to the Guinness Book, through his work, he had travelled to every single sovereign country in the world (which totalled 193 according to the Guinness Book) by 20 February 2004, aged 28 years and 361 days. He claimed that he had visited a total of up to 238 territories (including the 193 sovereign countries recognized by Guinness), and stated that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) had been the hardest country to get into, after numerous attempts and long waits to get a visa.

He started travelling at age 14, and believes that, as of 2004, he had travelled at least two million miles, including on the Trans-Siberian Railway and through 11 round-the-world air journeys. Some of his earliest journeys were to Albania and Sierra Leone in 1991, aged 16, and to Mongolia in 1992 for their national festivities Naadam. Most of his later travels were related to his journalistic work.

On 20 February 2004 he visited Suriname, thereby completing his visit to all sovereign nations of the world. He held a press conference there on 24 February, where he stated that he had chosen Suriname to complete his record, as the country had always fascinated him due to its richness and variety in cultures and ethnicities.
He then travelled from Suriname to London, with 42 passports (of which 30 were Italian and 12 British) filled with immigration stamps, in order to prove his record to Guinness World Records.

He claimed that most of his travels were unrelated to the record, and that only since 2001, on the suggestion of friends, did he have the Guinness Record in mind when planning his travels. In explaining his record, however, he stated that he might have an "addiction to crossing borders".

<doc id="93934" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=93934" title="Aang">
Aang

Aang is a fictional character and the main hero in Nickelodeon's television series "". The character was made by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko and voiced by Zach Tyler Eisen. He has take part in all the episodes of "Avatar", except "Zuko Alone" (7th episode of ). Aang is also in the first episode, "The Boy In The Iceberg". Aang appears in other media, like trading cards (a card that is collected), video games, T-shirts, and web comics.

Aang is the last Airbender. They were the only race of people who could control the air. He is 112 years old. He has not become older because he had been frozen in an iceberg for 100 years, and is still like a 12 year old, because he used Avatar State to protect himself and his bison. In the second show, it is discovered that Aang is the living form of the Avatar. This is the spirit of the planet in human form. As the Avatar, Aang controls the elements and must keep the Four Nations at peace. The show follows Aang's journeys to do this.

Most of Aang's habits, such as vegetarianism, are based on Buddhist and Taoist tradition. Aang is the series' unwilling hero. He shows hesitation when joining his friends to save the world from the Fire Nation. His "lighthearted" personality has been praised by critics. The creators wanted Aang to "win enemies with his wits" and be a "trickster hero".

Aang's character was created by Bryan Konietzko. The sketch showed a middle-aged man with an arrow on his head. Konietzko changed the character into a picture of a child with a flying bison. At the same time, Michael Dante DiMartino was interested in a documentary about explorers trapped in the South Pole. The idea caused the pair to think:
The plot they described relates with the first and second episodes of the series, where the "water people" (Katara and Sokka) find the "air guy" (Aang) while "trapped in a snowy wasteland" (the Southern Water Tribe) with "some fire people [that] are pressing down on them" (Fire Navy and Zuko). The creators of the show made Aang to be frozen in an iceberg for 1000 years. He was to wake inside a futuristic world, where he would have a robot named Momo and a flying bison named Appa. The creators lost interest in the theme, and changed it to 100 years of suspended animation. The robotic Momo was changed to a flying lemur, and the herd of bison was reduced to one.

Aang's character has a well grown cultural belief. According to the show's creators, ""Avatar" based on the belief of Buddhism and Taoism." A important part of the character is his vegetarian diet, regular with Buddhism or Taoism. In the Brahmajala Sutra, a Buddhist code of ethics, vegetarianism is encouraged. In "The King of Omashu" (the 5th episode of first season), Aang shows his vegetarian beliefs by refusing to eat meat. Aang shows a reluctance to fight and an dislike of killing. In "The Spirit World (Winter Solstice, Part 1)", Aang gets into a fight with an angry spirit who is destroying a village because the people burned his home (one forest). Instead of fighting the spirit, Aang talks with it. 

Airbending, the element that Aang mainly uses in the show, is based on Baguazhang, an "internal" Chinese martial art. This fighting style focuses on circular movements, and does not have many finishing moves. These characteristics were meant to show the unpredictability of air and the peaceful nature of Airbenders in the show.<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml"></ref>

In the episode "Tales of Ba Sing Se" (the 15th episode of ), Aang’s name was written as 安昂 (ān áng) in Chinese.

The creators of the show call each a "book" and each episode a "chapter"; each of these books was take the name of element that Aang must control, except the air. Flashbacks also reveal events that happened before the show opened. In a flashback during "The Storm", Aang remembered the day when elder monks told him that he was the Avatar. Monk Gyatso, Aang's teacher and father-figure, said that Aang must be raised as a normal child. Nearing the end, the monks began to believe that Gyatso interfered too much, so they decide to send Aang to the Eastern Air Temple. Aang refuses to be torn away from his mentor; he writes a note for Gyatso before flying away on his bison, Appa. It is revealed in the first episodes of the show that a violent storm catches Aang and sends him into the ocean during his escape. Aang then enters the Avatar State, unknowingly, for the first time to encase himself and Appa in a frozen air bubble. An image of this air bubble, resembling an iceberg, ends the flashback.

After the 100 years he was in the iceberg with his bison, the story starts when Katara and her brother Sokka free Aang and Appa in the . In the next episode, they all started the trip to the Northern Water Tribe, with hope to find a waterbending master to teach Aang and Katara how to control the water. During their journey they are chased by Zuko, the banished prince of the Fire Nation, who must capture the Avatar to return his honor. In one episode, Aang meets his previous incarnation, Avatar Roku (born on Fire Nation), who said him that he must learn all four bending arts and win Fire Lord Ozai before the end of summer. When the team, named team "Avatar", arrived in the Northern Water Tribe, a Waterbender named Master Pakku teaches Aang (and later Katara) waterbending. Later, in the , Aang meets Toph Bei Fong, a blind earthbending, who becomes his earthbending teacher. Later, Aang and his friends learn about the solar eclipse, which will occur before the end of the summer, and will block the Firebenders powerless. During the season finale, a guru tried to teach Aang how to open up his seven "chakras" in order to control the Avatar State. When Aang has a vision of Katara being in danger, he leaves the Air Temple where he is being taught before the seventh "chakra" is opened, locking it. He then battles in the underground caverns of Ba Sing Se. He is killed when Azula strikes him with lightning, but is brought back to life thanks to Katara's special water that has healing abilities, and also her healing abilities.

In the , Aang and his friends had to win a new enemy - an killer hired by Zuko who shoots with his third eye. Aang and his friends from Earth Kingdom attack the Fire Nation capital during the solar eclipse, but the invasion failed because Azula knew about it. In the next episode, Zuko offers to teach Aang firebending. Aang accepts, despite the group's strong opposition. In "The Firebending Masters" (the 13th episode of third season) Aang learns firebending with the help of the last two dragons.

Before the , he is trapped with his friends because he does not find correct he kills Ozai. After he sleepwalks into a forest, he speaks with four previous Avatars (Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, Yangchen), and asking for advice. Each gives him a reason to kill the Fire Lord Ozai, discouraging him. After discovering that the forest is atop a swimming lion-turtle, and receiving advice from said lion-turtle, he prepares to confront the Fire Lord. Once Ozai arrives, Aang engages him in battle. After sparing Ozai when redirecting his lightning and then being backed into a corner, Aang enters the Avatar State. The Avatar State tips the battle in Aang's favor, and makes swift work of Ozai. Using a technique taught to him by the lion-turtle, which called Energybending, Aang removes Ozai's ability to firebend, effectively eliminating the threat. Later, in the Fire Nation capital, Aang is seen in monk robes, standing beside Zuko while he become Fire Lord. He is later seen relaxing with his friends in Ba Sing Se. The series ends with Aang and Katara kissing.

Michael Dante DiMartino, one of the show's creators, said:
Aang is a vegetarian, as shown in "The King of Omashu" (the 5th episode of first season) and "The Headband" (the 2nd episode of third season) when he refuses to eat meat since the Air Nomads taught him that life is holy. Aang states a reluctance to fight in "The Spirit World (Winter Solstice, Part 1)"; Aang hopelessly negotiates with a spirit who is destroying a village instead of fighting. Due to his non-violent nature, he also shows ethical reluctance refusing to killing Firelord Ozai, and eventually strips Ozai of his bending instead of killing him. In the show, Aang has a complex network of friends extending over all four nations.

Aang, in "The Storm" (the 12th episode of first season), said that he wishes he had been there to help Air Nomads a century ago, but would rather live a child's carefree life. Many times in the show, Aang shows how much he cares for those are close to him. He also showed that he can act immaturely, and once tried to deceive others in order to keep the group together. In "Bato of the Water Tribe" (the 15th episode of first season), Aang thinks Katara and Sokka might leave to visit their father. Aang hides the map showing their father's whereabouts and lies about having it in the first place.

In some episodes, he shows flight abilities with airbending. One technique for this is to make a sphere of air and ride on it, which Aang calls the Air Scooter. Other methods of flying include his glider, and Appa. In the Avatar State, Aang can also fly inside a ball of air.

In the show's intended demographics, Aang has been received very well. Kendall Lyons said that, "Aang seems to be the happy kid that you can easily familiarize yourself with", and that he "seems to bring comfort in the most dangerous or trouble situations." There are many similar descriptions about Aang as a child-like character who is "reckless and excitable". Reviews point out that "as the Avatar, Aang seems unstoppable, but as Aang, he is just another like an airbender". The review says later that the show continues to focus on a more realistic character instead of a perfect one by showing many weaknesses in his character.

Aang's character showed in the "". He is 1 of the 4 characters of , a video game based on the first season of the show. Two sequels were made: "", a video game based on the second season of the show, and "", a video game based on the third season. Avatar T-shirts, some with Aang's face on them, are being sold on the Nickelodeon Shop website. Tokyopop has published a films comic (sometimes referred to as cine-manga), in which Aang is the main character, like in "Avatar: The Last Airbender".

Aang is in "Escape from the Spirit World", an online video game that is on Nickelodeon's real website. The game has some plot changes that are not in the show. The show's directors, Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, say the events are canon.

In 2008, M. Night Shyamalan, a film director, cast 12-year-old Tae Kwon Do practitioner Noah Ringer as Aang in the film adaptation of the series, "The Last Airbender". The casting of a white actor in the role of Aang (as well as a primarily Caucasian cast) in the Asian-influenced "Avatar" universe triggered negative reactions from some fans marked by accusations of racism, a letter-writing campaign, and a protest outside of a Philadelphia casting call for movie extras. The casting decisions were also negatively received by several critics who stated that the original casting call expressed a preference for Caucasian actors over others.

Jak and Daxter (series)

Jak and Daxter is a series of video games, developed by the company Naughty Dog. It is named after the two heroes of the games. Right now, five games are in the series.

All of the "Jak and Daxter" games happen on a planet that is similar to Earth, where many creatures who look like humans with long ears live. A long time ago, beings called "Precursors" lived on the planet, but disappeared, and the people use the machines the Precursors left behind. Outside of cities and villages, there are many wild and dangerous animals. 

A substance called "Eco" is also used by the people. It can be found as gas, liquid, or even solid crystals. There are several different kinds of Eco, and all the different Ecos can do special things. Green Eco can heal injuries or damage, and Blue Eco can make things move faster. There is also Dark Eco, a dangerous kind of Eco which can kill or mutate. In the first "Jak and Daxter" game, "", the character Daxter falls into a pit full of Dark Eco and turns into an "Ottsel", a fictional, or not real, cross between an otter and a weasel.

When Naughty Dog first told people about "Jak and Daxter", people were very excited, because Naughty Dog had made the famous "Crash Bandicoot" series. "Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy" was one of the first video games to use something called streaming, which means that the game loads while it is being played, so there are no loading screens. It was also very similar to the games "Super Mario 64" and "Banjo-Kazooie", because players need to jump, explore, and collect a special kind of object to win the game.

After "The Precursor Legacy", the "Jak and Daxter" games started to be about other things, not just jumping and finding things. "Jak II", the second game, gives the player guns to shoot and vehicles to drive. This is like in the "Grand Theft Auto" video games. 

The first three games of the "Jak" series; "Precursor Legacy", "Jak II", and "Jak 3"; are still mainly about platforming. The player controls the character Jak or the character Daxter in jumping puzzles to get to a goal. The character can only get hit by wild animals or monsters only a few times before dying and having to start the goal over, but the character can get life back by touching Green Eco. In "Jak 3", the player can get armor that lets Jak be hit more before dying. 

The player can also use attacks or guns to kill the monsters before Jak or Daxter is hit and hurt.

Matrixism or The path of the One is a new religion based on the movie "The Matrix". It was started by a group of people in the year 2004. By the year 2005, Matrixism had over 300 members and it was seen in books and newspapers. There are now 16,000 members of Matrixism.

Matrixism is a syncretic religion (a religion that joins together all religions). The words "the matrix" are seen in a Baha'i book from the year 1912 named "The Promulgation (starting) of Universal (complete international) Peace". Matrixism uses this fact to make a connection to the history of world religion but the three "Matrix" motion pictures are Matrixism's Bible (prime book).

Matrixism has four beliefs called "The Four Tenets (rules) of Matrixism". The four rules are; 1) Belief in the prophecy of the One. 2) Use of psychedelics (mind expansion medicine) as sacrament. 3) Seeing the relative nature of the world. 4) Acting by the rules of one of the world's religions. For Matrixism April 19th is a holiday (special day) named Bicycle Day. November 22nd is another holiday for Matrixism named the Day of Remembrance and Reflection. Aldous Huxley, John F. Kennedy and C.S. Lewis all died on this day in 1963.

The sign for Matrixism is , the Japanese kanji for the word "red". This sign was used in the computer game "Enter the Matrix". The color is a reference to the "red pill", from the motion picture "The Matrix", which is representative of being able to see that which is true. The word (sign) 赤 is also a Chinese word (character). In fact, the Japanese kanji is from a Chinese character.

In , Toad's hat is available after getting 3000 points in Tom Nook's Point Tracking system.

Toad ranked in the seventh slot on Game Daily's top 10 Nintendo characters that deserve their own games list; the site explained that he has a strong appeal that Nintendo has yet to tap into. Toad is listed as number 2 in the most neglected Mario Bros. characters list as he has been described by the site to have been ignored by Nintendo for quite a while due to the lack of starring roles he gets in the more recent games.

IGN editor Matt Casamassina criticized Nintendo for including the Toads over more notable characters in the "Mario" series for New Super Mario Bros.

The musical movie is a movie genre in which several songs sung by the characters are linked into the story line. The songs are used to advance the plot or develop the movie's characters.

The musical movie was a natural development of the stage musical.

Musical movies usually contain elements similar of theater; performers often treat their song and dance numbers as if there is a live audience watching.

Carbon footprint

The term carbon footprint is how much carbon goes into the air because of something done by people (not by nature). Doing something that burns fuel will make carbon dioxide gas in the smoke. Carbon dioxide has carbon in it. Just as walking on the sand leaves a footprint, burning fuel leaves carbon dioxide in the air, which is called a carbon footprint.

Oil, gas, and coal are called "fossil fuels" because they come from fossils of ancient plants and animals. Those plants and animals had carbon in them. So when we burn oil, gas, and coal, the carbon becomes carbon dioxide and goes into the air as smoke. This makes pollution. It also makes the greenhouse effect, which means that the carbon dioxide makes the earth warmer, like a greenhouse. A carbon footprint is the carbon dioxide that is put into the air because of a person, a group of people, an event or a product.

The words "carbon footprint" are often seen in the news. They are used with the word sustainability, which means that we can keep doing something without making something bad happen. That is, if there is too much of a carbon footprint, then there is no sustainability. People and businesses are often asked to think about how much carbon they are putting into the air, and how this changes the environment and maybe causes global warming. This is often said about traveling by airplane or by car, because burning fuel makes carbon dioxide gas.

Louisiana Purchase

The Louisiana Purchase was a land purchase made by United States president Thomas Jefferson in 1803. He bought the Louisiana territory from France, which was being led by Napoleon Bonaparte at the time, for $15,000,000 USD. At first the men sent to France were allowed to spend up to $10,000,000 USD in order to buy New Orleans and, if possible, the west bank of the Mississippi River. But then the French government said that for five million more dollars they would sell all of the Louisiana territory. Thomas Jefferson approved the deal and used his constitutional power to sign treaties to buy the land. Napoleon sold the land because he was desperate for money and he was afraid of losing his North American territories to the British.
Napoleon Bonaparte had been busy with a war in Europe, and no matter how badly that Bonaparte wanted to go about in his interests with America, there was no way that he could do so with what he had been occupied in Europe with. Thomas Jefferson took this as an opportunity to make America larger, even if it meant going against his republican principles of only doing exactly what the Constitution said he could do (because nothing in the Constitution specifically said that he could buy the land).

The Louisiana Purchase is important because it gave the U.S. control of the Mississippi River and the port city of New Orleans, both of which were used by farmers to ship their crops and get paid. It also got rid of one country that might try to harm the new nation because France sold all of their North American territory. 

The Lewis and Clark expedition explored the Louisiana Purchase and the Oregon Territory. They started from St. Louis. Their route traced the Missouri River.

According to several reports in the German media, several human remains of the bronze period have been found in the region named Tollense valley since 1997. 

Many showed signs of injury and violent death. In 2008 research was concentrated on an area of . Hundreds of bone fragments, as well as wooden weaponry and flintstone arrowheads have been discovered. The finds were possible due to the preservation of the former swamp ground and the fact that the Tollense has never really changed its flow. 

It is now estimated that about 200 people died in a battle-like scenario in that valley about 1250 BC. Since the population then was about 5 people per square kilometre, about 13 people per square mile, this would've been the most important battle in bronze age Germany yet to be discovered. More investigation of the grounds is planned for the years 2010 to 2015.

Fritz Reuter

Fritz Reuter (7 November 1810–12 July 1874) was a German novelist. He was born at Stavenhagen in Mecklenburg-Schwerin.

In 1831, Reuter started to study at the University of Rostock, and in 1832 went to the University of Jena. At Jena he joined a "Burschenschaft" (political students' club). In 1833 he was arrested in Berlin by the Prussian government. He had only been only wearing the club's colours, but he was condemned to death for high treason. King Frederick William III of Prussia changed this to imprisonment for thirty years. In 1838 he was sent to a prison in Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and he spent two years in the fortress of Dömitz. Reuter was set free in 1840, when Frederick William IV became king of Prussia.

After his release from prison, Reuter started studying law again at the University of Heidelberg but had to leave and go back to Stavenhagen and help to run his father's farm. When his father died, he gave up farming, and in 1850 became a private teacher in a little town then called Treptow-an-der-Tollense in Pomerania. Here he married Luise Kunze, the daughter of a Mecklenburg pastor.

Reuter's first book was written in Low German. It was published in 1853. Three years later Reuter decided to give up teaching to become a writer, so he left Treptow and moved to Neubrandenburg.

"Ut de Franzosentid" and "Ut mine Stromtid" are Reuter's best books. In them he describes the men and women he knew in the villages and farmhouses of Mecklenburg. "Ut de Franzosentid" is set at the time of the fight against Napoleon. "Ut mine Stromtid" describes the revolutionary movement of 1848.

In 1863 Reuter moved from Neubrandenburg to Eisenach and here he died on 12 July 1874. In the books he wrote at Eisenach were not as good as his earlier writings.

 The article is available here: 

A complete bibliography of Fritz Reuter can be found in the "Niederdeutsches Jahrbuch" for 1896 and 1902.

Oppose demotion I just removed all of the extra stuff to see how long the article is, and it is still 6.05kbs. 16:41, 12 February 2008 (UTC)

Visually looks like a short article, doesn't have a very satisfying references section, doesn't have very good sentence structure, and overall, feels like an article that has need of much more work to be done before it can be ready to be a VGA. I would suggest this be promoted down to a regular article unless someone is able to do an extensive copyedit of this article to make it more appropriate for this Wikipedia. 16:13, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

This article was recently demoted from VGA status to GA status, however, I have concerns that it doesn't meet all of the GA requirements. As per the page, I have decided that the template should count as a article improvement template, meaning that this page doesn't meet all of the requirements to be a GA. 16:20, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

This article fails the requirements for no redlinks. It could also use some copyediting. I know for a fact that this article doesn't meet all the requirements for either VGAs or GAs, so therefore, I am recommending that this article be demoted to regular status unless these 2 issues are fixed. If the 2 issues are fixed, I will gladly withdraw this request. 16:30, 19 February 2008 (UTC)


This article fails the requirements for references; it has no references. It also fails requirement #8, because it has the template on it. It could also use a copyediting for sentence fluidity and general spell checking. I am in full support of this being downgraded to regular article status, but will happily withdraw this request if these issues are fixed. 17:08, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

This article fails the requirement for redlinks; it has a red link. It could also use a bit of copyediting, mainly to make the sentences shorter, and to make some of the sentences flow smoother. I support this article be demoted to regular article status if the red link isn't fixed; if both the red link and copyediting are fixed, then I will withdraw this request. 17:15, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

This article, for its size has way too little references, and has numerous POV problems, for example: ""People should choose an instrument that they enjoy playing, because playing regularly is the only way to get better. Finally, it helps to have a good teacher." Another excerpt: "There is so much music today, in elevators, shopping malls, and stores, that music it often becomes a background sound that we do not really hear." -- () 02:40, 23 February 2008 (UTC)

The main problem with this article is the size. With all extra fluff removed, this article is only 3.6 kb, and it is short visually. -- () 00:37, 24 February 2008 (UTC)


This article has over 10 red links (none are allowed for a "good" article status). Some of the structure didn't fit, so overall the article doesn't, in my opinion, meet the "full" criteria. 00:27, 8 May 2008 (UTC)

Li Bai

Li Bai or Li Po (李白 Lǐ Bái / Lǐ Bó) (701-762) was a Chinese poet. 

His fellow poet Du Fu counted him to the group of Chinese scholars that he called the "Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup" in a poem. Li Bai is often regarded, along with Du Fu, as one of the two greatest poets in China's literary history. Today we know about 1,100 of his poems. 

The first translations in a Western language were published in 1862 by Marquis d'Hervey de Saint-Denys in his "Poésies de l'Époque des Thang". The English-speaking world was introduced to Li Bai's works by a Herbert Allen Giles publication "History of Chinese Literature" (1901) and through the liberal, but poetically influential, translations of Japanese versions of his poems made by Ezra Pound.

Li Bai is best known for the extravagant imagination and striking Taoist images in his poetry,and for his great love for . He spent much of his life travelling. People tell the story that he fell from his boat when he tried to embrace the reflection of the moon, and therefore drowned in the Yangtze River.

One of Li Bai's most famous poems is "Drinking Alone by Moonlight" (, pinyin: Yuè Xià Dú Zhuó), which is a good example of some of the most famous aspects of his poetry -- a very spontaneous poem, full of natural images. Li Bai actually wrote several poems with the same title; Arthur Waley's version of the most famous reads:

Li Bai is influential in the West partly due to Ezra Pound's versions of some of his poems in the collection "Cathay", such as . In the east he influenced poets like Mi Fei in the Song Dynasty.

A crater on the planet Mercury has been named after him.

Naguib Mahfouz

Naguib Mahfouz (, ) (December 11, 1911 – August 30, 2006) was an Egyptian novelist who won the 1988 Nobel Prize for Literature and who managed to modernize Arabic literature. He is one of the few writers of Arabic literature, who explored themes of existentialism. 

Mahfouz was born in the Gamaliya quarter of Cairo and was named after Professor Naguib Pasha Mahfouz (1882-1974), the renowned Coptic physician who delivered him. In his childhood Mahfouz read extensively. His mother often took him to museums and Egyptian history later became a major theme in many of his books.

The Egyptian Revolution of 1919 had a strong effect on Mahfouz, although he was at the time only seven years old. From the window he often saw English soldiers firing at the demonstrators, men and women. "You could say," he later noted, "that the one thing which most shook the security of my childhood was the 1919 revolution." 

Before the Nobel Prize only a few of his novels had appeared in the West. 
Because of his outspoken support for Sadat's Camp David peace treaty with Israel, his books were banned in many Arab countries until after he won the Nobel prize.

Like many Egyptian writers and intellectuals, Mahfouz was on a "death list" by Islamic fundamentalists. He defended Salman Rushdie after the Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini condemned him to death, but later he criticized Rushdie's Satanic Verses as "insulting" to Islam. 

Before his death, Mahfouz was the oldest living Nobel Literature laureate and the third oldest of all time, only Bertrand Russell and Halldor Laxness were older. At the time of his death, he was the only Arabic-language writer to have won the Nobel Prize for Literature.

Puritanism

The Puritans were a significant grouping of English-speaking Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries. Puritans felt that the English Reformation had not gone far enough, and that the Church of England was tolerant of practices which they associated with the Catholic Church.

A Puritan was any person seeking 'purity' through worship and doctrine. Piety, simplicity of dress and modesty of life were hallmarks. Many of their beliefs were similar to those of Calvinists and Scottish Presbyterians. They did not have an all-embracing theology, beyond a devotion to the Bible and moral purity. Puritans believed that political leaders are accountable to God to protect and reward virtue (including 'true religion'), and to punish wrongdoers. They opposed the supremacy of the monarch in the church, and argued that the only head of the Church in heaven or earth is Christ.

Personal biblical interpretation is central to Puritan beliefs, and is shared with Protestantism in general. Puritans sought conformity to the teaching of the Bible, with moral purity pursued down to the smallest detail as well as ecclesiastical purity to the highest level. They believed that man existed for the glory of God; that his first concern in life was to do God's will and so to receive future happiness.

Like some of Reformed churches on the European continent, Puritan reforms were typified by a minimum of ritual and decoration, and by an emphasis on preaching. Puritan ideals were highly influential in New England, to where many groups emigrated. John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's progress was an important work. Very often, hell was the subject of sermons. A well-known sermon is "Sinners in the hands of an angry god" by Jonathan Edwards.

Munshi Premchand

Munshi Premchand (July 31, 1880 - October 8, 1936) was a writer of modern Hindi and Urdu literature. 

Premchand (Hindi: प्रेमचंद, Urdu: پریمچںد), whose original name was "Dhanpat Rai Srivastava", was born on 31 July 1880, in village "Lamahi" near Varanasi, where his father was a clerk in the post office. Premchand's parents died young - his mother when he was seven and his father while he was fourteen and still a student. Premchand was left responsible for his stepmother and step-siblings. 

Early in life, Premchand faced immense poverty. He earned five rupees a month tutoring a lawyer's child. He was married at the early age of fifteen but that marriage failed, later he married again, to Shivrani Devi, a balavidhava, (child widow), and had several children, she supported him through life struggles. 

Premchand passed his exam with great effort in 1898, and in 1899 he took up school-teaching job, with a monthly salary of eighteen rupees. In 1919 he passed his B.A. with English, Persian and History. 

Later, Premchand worked as the deputy sub-inspector of schools.

Premchand lived a life of financial struggle. Once he took a loan of two-and-a-half rupees to buy some clothes. He had to struggle for three years to pay it back.

When asked why he does not write anything about himself, he answered: "What greatness do I have that I have to tell anyone about? I live just like millions of people in this country; I am ordinary. My life is also ordinary. I am a poor school teacher suffering family travails. During my whole lifetime, I have been grinding aay with the hope that I could become free of my sufferings. But I have not been able to free myself from wsuffering. What is so special about this life that needs to be told to anybody?". 

During his last years,he became terribly ill. The money his wife used to give for his treatment was used in running his press "The Saraswati". He was also writing a book "Mangalsutra" which would never be completed. All this had serious impact on his health leading to his early death on 8th October 1936, at the age of 56.

The main characteristic of Premchand's writings is his interesting story-telling and use of simple language. His novels describe the problems of the rural peasant classes. He avoided the use of highly Sanskritized Hindi (as was the common practice among Hindi writers), but rather he used the dialect of the common people.

Premchand has written about 300 short stories, several novels as well as many essays and letters. He has also written some plays. He also did some translations. Many of Premchand's stories have been translated into English and Russian.

"Godaan" (The Gift of a Cow), his last novel, is considered the finest Hindi novel of all times. The hero, Hori, a poor peasant, desperately longs for a cow, a symbol of wealth and prestige in rural India. Hori gets a cow but pays with his life for it. After his death, the village priests demand a cow from his widow to bring his soul to peace.

In "Kafan" (Shroud), a poor man collects money for the funeral rites of his dead wife, but spends it on food and drink.



 prem ki vedi

Satyajit Ray filmed two of Premchand's works — "Sadgati" and "Shatranj Ke Khiladi". "Sadgati" (Salvation) is a short story about poor Dukhi, who gets exhausted to death while he hews wood for more or less nothing. "Shatranj ke Khiladi" (The Chess Players) tells the story of chess players who are so concentrated on a game that they forget their responsibilities in the midst of a crisis.

A Dependent territory is a territory that belongs to another state or nation. As an example, Greenland is a dependent territory of Denmark, Saint Helena is a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, and Pakistan-administered Kashmir is a disputed and dependent territory of Pakistan.

Dependency claims without general international recognition, including all claims in Antarctica, are listed in "italics". The list includes several territories that are not included in the list of non-self-governing territories listed by the General Assembly of the United Nations, as well as those that are not legally classified as dependencies by their respective sovereign government. 

Although all territories of Australia are considered to be fully integrated in its federative system, and the official status of an external territory does not differ largely from that of a mainland territory, debate remains as to whether the external territories are integral parts of Australia, due to their not being part of Australia in 1901, when its constituent states federated. They are often listed separately for statistical purposes.

Overseas France consists of 4 overseas departments ("Départements d'outre-mer") and all overseas territories ("Territoires d'outre-mer"). Overseas departments, along with those of Metropolitan France, are constituent units of the French Republic. Overseas territories are listed below.

In contrast, Svalbard is fully a part of Norway. Svalbard is subject to several special laws, but its government is not independent and does not decide laws on its own.

When a direct connection between two computers (clients) is not possible for some services (eg. HTTP, FTP, or chat protocols like MSN and AOL), a user can use these services via a so-called SOCKS server (routing).

Example: Bill wants to chat with Jane. Bill has a bad service provider who limits internet access. Bill's computer then connects to the SOCKS server, which is able to "chat" with Jane's computer without restrictions.

Eldest is the second book in the "Inheritance Cycle" written by Christopher Paolini in 2005. It comes after "Eragon", and was first published in hardcover on August 23, 2005, and was released in paperback in September of 2006.

In this book Eragon, with his dragon Saphira visits the elf city Ellesmera to complete his training. He is accompanied by a dwarf Orik and the elf, Arya. Here he finds out that the mysterious Mourning Sage had been another rider named Oromis, and his dragon Glaedr. Oromis is an Elf and is very old so he cannot fight Galbatorix but he can teach Eragon and Saphira. Eragon now has his own disability; his back pains him very much when ever he fights or exerts himself. During his stay, in a celebration of the elves the dragons grant Eragon with a gift, he is transformed, gaining the physical features of an elf. His back is also healed. He becomes much faster, stronger and his lessons become easier. His training is disrupted by news that the Varden are being attacked by a huge army sent by Galbatorix. Eragon goes to their aid and helps them in battle and has an encounter with another dragon rider and his red dragon. The Rider turns out to be Murtagh. Galbatorix had captured him after the battle in Farthen Dur and when a dragon hatched for him, Galbatorix made them swear oaths in the Ancient Language (so they cannot break them) that they would only serve him. They are bound by their oath to try and capture Eragon and Saphira. Eragon loses but Murtagh leaves him because he has "tried", telling him that Galbatorix will make sure Murtagh's oaths are stronger next time. He takes Za'roc from Eragon, because it was Morzan's sword. He also tells Eragon they are brothers and that Eragon is also the son of Morzan.

Treaty of Verdun

The Treaty of Verdun (843) happened several generations after Charlemagne and divided his empire into three parts. When Charlemagne's grandson Louis the Pious died in 840, his oldest son Lothair I said that he ruled his younger brothers and their lands. But his brothers Louis the German and Charles the Bald won the Battle of Fontenay (841).

Each of the brothers already had one kingdom - Lothair in Italy, Louis the German in Bavaria, and Charles the Bald in Aquitaine.

Steeping

Steeping may mean:

One example is the steeping of corn, part of the milling process. As described by the US Corn Refiners Association, harvested kernels of corn are cleaned and then steeped in water at a temperature of 50 degrees for 30 to 40 hours. In the process their moisture content rises from 15% to 45% and their volume more than doubles. The gluten bonds in the corn are weakened and starch is released. 

The corn is then ground to break free the germ and other components, and the water used (steepwater), which has absorbed various nutrients, is recycled for use in animal feeds.

<doc id="95380" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95380" title="Gluten">
Gluten

Gluten is a composite of the proteins "gliadin" and "glutenin". These proteins are found in the endosperms of some grass-like grains such as wheat, rye and barley. Gliadin and glutenin make up about 80% of the protein contained in wheat seed. As they are insoluble in water, they can be got by washing away the starch in the grain. Worldwide, gluten is an important source of food protein, both in foods prepared directly from grains with gluten in them, and as an additive to foods that are low in protein.

Some people are very sensitive to glutens in their food. When they eat foods which contain gluten, these people may experience stomach cramps, bloating, gas and diarrhoea. This sensitivity is called coeliac disease (in North America, it is usually spelled "celiac disease").

<doc id="95383" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95383" title="Octal">
Octal

The octal numeral system is a base 8 numeral system. It uses the numerals 0 through 7. The system is similar to binary (base 2) and hexadecimal (base 16). Octal numerals are written using the letter "o" before the numeral, for example, o04 or o1242.

At one time, the octal system was used mainly for work with computers. It provided an easier way to work with binary numbers. As computers changed from using 24-bit systems to 32- and 64-bit systems, hexadecimal replaced octal for most uses. Certain groups, for example, Native Americans using the Yuki language in California and the Pamean languages in Mexico, also use an octal numbering system. They do this because when they count, they use the spaces between their fingers instead of counting the actual fingers.

The octal numeral system uses a three-bit binary coding. Each digit in an octal numeral is the same as three digits in a binary numeral. The grouping of the binary digits is done from right to left. The first three binary digits from the right are grouped into the last part of the octal numeral, then the next three digits form the next to the last part of the numeral.
In the decimal system (base 10), each digit in octal is equal to that digit multiplied by the exponent of 8 that is equal to its location minus one.
Example: o3425 to decimal
Octal is similar to hexadecimal because they are both easily converted to binary. Where octal is equal to three-digit binary, hexadecimal is equal to four-digit binary. Where octal numerals start with the letter "o", hexadecimal numerals end with the letter "h". The easiest way to convert from one to the other is to convert to binary and then to the other system.

Gardenia

Gardenia is a genus of about 250 species of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. Gardenia can be found in the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, southern Asia, Australasia and Oceania. 

The genus was named by Carl Linnaeus after "Dr Alexander Garden" (1730-1791), Scottish-born American naturalist.

They are evergreen shrubs and small trees growing to 1-15 m tall. The leaves are opposite or in whorls of three or four, 5-50 cm long and 3-25 cm broad, dark green and glossy with a leathery texture. The flowers are solitary or in small clusters, white or pale yellow. Flowering is from about mid-spring to mid-summer and many species are strongly scented.

Gardenia plants are prized for the strong sweet scent of their flowers, which can be very large in some species.

Gardenias have a reputation for being difficult to grow. Because they originated in warm humid tropical areas, they demand high humidity.

Radical (Chinese character)

A radical (from Latin "radix", meaning "root") is the portion bearing the meaning of an inflected European word in Chinese. Early Western sinologists borrowed this term to refer to the semantic component of a Chinese character (Hanzi). Later, the term was also borrowed for a "second" meaning, the 部首 (Pinyin: "bùshǒu", Japanese "bushu", Korean "busu"). This literally means "section header". It refers to the place where a character is listed in the dictionary. 

For example, in the character 媽 "mā" or “mother” (shown right), the left part 女 (pronounced nǚ in Mandarin Chinese) happens to be the semantic component and also the section header under which dictionaries list the graph. However, not all section headers function in a particular character as the semantic component; some are based on phonetics, while others are merely chosen for convenience, and play neither a semantic nor a phonetic role. These two meanings of “radical” are not synonymous, though they may coincide in a particular example, causing a great deal of confusion. (For clarity, both semantic component and section header terms are used here.)

The equivalents in cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphics are called determinatives.

Chinese character components, whether semantic or phonetic in role, are the building blocks for all Chinese Hanzi as well as in the derived forms of Japanese Kanji, Korean Hanja, and Vietnamese Chữ nôm and Chữ nho.
Since the Kangxi dictionary of 1716 was indexed using the 214 
"Zìhuì" section headers, the standard list thereof has remained unchanged. Section headers are foundationally important for the organisation and use of Hanzi, Kanji, and Hanja dictionaries.

Gladwyn Jebb

Hubert Miles Gladwyn Jebb, 1st Baron Gladwyn, GCMG, GCVO, CB, known as Gladwyn Jebb ( – ), was a prominent British civil servant, diplomat and politician as well as the first Acting Secretary-General of the United Nations.

After World War II, he served as Executive Secretary of the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations in August 1945. He was appointed Acting United Nations Secretary-General from October 1945 to February 1946 until the appointment of the first Secretary-General Trygve Lie.

Returning to London, Jebb was Deputy to the Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin at the Conference of Foreign Ministers before serving as the Foreign Office's United Nations Adviser (1946-47). He represented the United Kingdom at the Brussels Treaty Permanent Commission with personal rank of Ambassador. He became the United Kingdom's Ambassador to the United Nations from 1950-1954 and to Paris from 1954-1960.

In 1960 Jebb was made a hereditary peer and as Baron Gladwyn became involved in politics as a member of the Liberal Party. He was Deputy Leader of the Liberals in the House of Lords 1965-1988 and spokesman on foreign affairs and defence. An supporter of the European Union, he served as a Member of the European Parliament 1973-1976 where he was also the Vice-President of the Parliament's Political Committee. He tried to be elected to the European Parliament in 1979.

When asked why he had joined the Liberal party in the early 1960s, he replied that the Liberals were a party without a general and that he was a general without a party. Like many Liberals, he passionately believed that education was the key to social reform.

He died in 1996, and is buried at St. Andrew's, Bramfield in the county of Suffolk.

Jebb's wife, Cynthia, Lady Gladwyn, was a noted diarist of their times in Paris and a hostess of Liberal and London politics. She was the great-grand daughter of Isambard Kingdom Brunel.

Trygve Lie

Trygve Halvdan Lie () (July 16, 1896 – December 30, 1968) was a Norwegian politician. From 1946 to 1952 he was the first elected Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Lie was born in Oslo (then Kristiania) on 16 July 1896. He joined the Labour Party in 1911 and was named as the party's national secretary soon after getting his law degree from the University of Oslo in 1919. He married Hjørdis Jørgensen in 1921; the couple had three daughters, Sissel, Guri, and Mette.

Later he was elected to the Storting (Norway's Parliament). He was appointed Minister of Justice when a Labour Party government was formed by Johan Nygaardsvold in 1935. Lie was later named Minister of Trade and Industries and Minister of Supply and Shipping.

In 1940, when Norway was invaded by Germany, Lie ordered all Norwegian ships to sail to Allied ports. Lie was named as Foreign Minister of the Norwegian government-in-exile.

Lie led the Norwegian "delegation" (group) to the United Nations conference in San Francisco in 1946 and was a leader in drafting the rules to set up the United Nations Security Council. He was the leader of the Norwegian delegation to the United Nations general assembly in 1946. On February 1, 1946, he was elected as the first United Nations Secretary-General as a result of a compromise between the major powers, having only missed being elected President of the first General Assembly by a small margin. He gets much of the credit for securing the current site for the United Nations headquarters from John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and establishing the offices there.

As Secretary General, Lie supported the foundation of Israel and Indonesia. He worked for the withdrawal of Soviet forces in Iran and a stop to fighting in Kashmir. He attracted the anger of the Soviet Union when he helped gather support for the defence of South Korea after it was invaded in 1950 and later worked to end the Soviet boycott of UN meetings, though his involvement has only little to do with the eventual return of the Soviet Union to the UN. He was opposed to Spain's entry into the United Nations because of his opposition to the Franco government. He also sought to have the People's Republic of China recognized by the United Nations after the Nationalist government was exiled to Taiwan, arguing that the People's Republic was the only government which could fulfill the membership obligations in full. This did not happen until the 1970s.

He has been criticized for his failures to facilitate negotiation in the Berlin Blockade, as well as his failure to bring about a more swift end to the Korean War. His critics argue that he was under the influence of a select few in the UN Secretariat. He has also been criticized for his arrogance and stubbornness.

Over objections from the Soviet Union, his term of office was extended by the General Assembly 46 - 5 in 1950. This was the result of a Security Council impasse, in which the US refused to accept any candidate but Lie, and the Soviet Union's absolute refusal to accept him again, due to his involvement in the Korean War. The Soviet Union refused to acknowledge him as secretary general in his second term, and after having been accused by Joseph McCarthy of hiring "disloyal" Americans (an allegation which he attributed to the rapid hiring of civil servants necessary after the creation of the organization), Lie resigned on November 10, 1952.

Lie remained active in Norwegian politics after his resignation from the UN. He was the Governor of Oslo and Akershus, Chairman of the Board of Energy, Minister of the Interior, and Minister of Trade.

Lie died on December 30, 1968 of a heart attack. He was 72 years old.

<doc id="95509" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95509" title="U Thant">
U Thant

U Thant 22 January 1909 – 25 November 1974) was a Burmese diplomat and the third Secretary-General of the United Nations, from 1961 to 1971. He was chosen after his predecessor Dag Hammarskjöld was killed in a plane crash in September 1961.

"U" is a word in Burmese, roughly equal to "Mister." "Thant" was his only name. In Burmese he was known as Pantanaw U Thant. His home town is Pantanaw, so this means "Mr Thant of Pantanaw"

When U Nu became the Prime Minister of the newly independent Burma, he asked Thant to join him in Rangoon and appointed him as Director of Broadcasting in 1948. In the following year he was appointed Secretary to the Government of Burma in the Ministry of Information. From 1951 to 1957, Thant was Secretary to the Prime Minister. He also took part in a number of international conferences and was the secretary of the first Asian-African summit in 1955 at Bandung, Indonesia which gave birth to the Non-Aligned Movement.

From 1957 to 1961, he was Burma's Permanent Representative (Ambassador) to the United Nations, and became actively involved in negotiations over Algerian independence. In 1960 the Burmese government awarded him the title "Maha Thray Sithu" as a commander in the Pyidaungsu Sithu Thingaha Order (similar to an order of knights).

Thant began serving as Acting Secretary-General from November 3 1961, when he was unanimously appointed by the General Assembly, on the recommendation of the Security Council, to fill the unexpired term of Dag Hammarskjöld. He was then unanimously appointed Secretary-General by the General Assembly on November 30 1962 for a term of office ending on November 3 1966. During this first term he was widely credited for his role in defusing the Cuban Missile Crisis and for ending the civil war in the Congo.

U Thant was appointed to a second term as Secretary-General of the United Nations by the General Assembly on December 2 1966 on the unanimous recommendation of the Security Council. His term of office continued until December 31 1971, when he retired. During his time in office, he oversaw the entry into the UN of dozens of new Asian and African states and was a firm opponent of apartheid in South Africa. He also established many of the UN's development and environmental agencies, funds and programmes, including the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN University, UNCTAD, UNITAR and the UN Environmental Programme.

He had also led many successful though now largely forgotten peace making efforts, for example in Yemen in 1962 and Bahrain in 1968. In each case, war would have provoked a wider regional conflict, and it was Thant's quiet mediation which prevented war.

Unlike his two predecessors, Thant retired after ten years on speaking terms with all the big powers. In 1961 when he was first appointed, the Soviet Union had tried to insist on a "troika" formula of three Secretaries-General, one representing each Cold War bloc, something which would have maintained equality in the United Nations between the superpowers. By 1966, when Thant was reappointed, all the big powers, in a unanimous vote of the Security Council, affirmed the importance of the Secretary-Generalship and his good offices, a clear tribute to Thant's work.

The Six Day War between Arab countries and Israel, the Prague Spring and subsequent Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 leading to the birth of Bangladesh all took place during his time as Secretary-General.

He was widely criticized in the US and Israel for agreeing to pull UN troops out of the Sinai in 1967 in response to a request from Egyptian President Nasser. U Thant tried to persuade Nasser not to go to war with Israel by flying to Cairo in a last minute peace effort.

His once good relationship with the US government deteriorated rapidly when he publicly criticized American conduct of the Vietnam War. His secret attempts at direct peace talks between Washington and Hanoi were eventually rejected by the Johnson Administration.

Thant followed unidentified flying object reports with some interest; in 1967, he arranged for American atmospheric physicist Dr. James E. McDonald to speak before the UN's Outer Space Affairs Group regarding UFOs.

On January 23 1971 U Thant categorically announced that he would "under no circumstances" be available for a third term as Secretary-General. For many weeks, the UN Security Council was deadlocked over the search for a successor before finally settling on Kurt Waldheim to succeed U Thant as Secretary-General on December 21, 1971 — Waldheim's 53rd birthday — and just ten days before U Thant's second term was to have ended.

In his farewell address to the United Nations General Assembly Secretary-General U Thant stated that he felt a 'great sense of relief bordering on liberation' on relinquishing the 'burdens of office'. In an editorial published around December 27, 1971 praising U Thant, "The New York Times" stated that "the wise counsel of this dedicated man of peace will still be needed after his retirement". The editorial was entitled "The Liberation of U Thant".

U Thant died of lung cancer in New York on November 25 1974. By this time Burma was ruled by a military junta which refused him any honors. The then Burmese President Ne Win was envious of U Thant's international stature and the respect that was accorded him by the Burmese populace. Ne Win also resented U Thant's close links with the democratic government of U Nu which Ne Win had overthrown in a coup d'etat on March 2 1962. Ne Win ordered that U Thant be buried without any official involvement or ceremony.

From the United Nations headquarters in New York, U Thant's body was flown back to Rangoon but no guard of honour or high ranking officials were on hand at the airport when the coffin arrived.

On the day of U Thant's funeral on December 5 1974, tens of thousands of people lined the streets of Rangoon to pay their last respects to their distinguished countryman whose coffin was displayed at Rangoon's Kyaikasan race course for a few hours before the scheduled burial.

The coffin of U Thant was then snatched by a group of students just before it was scheduled to leave for burial in an ordinary Rangoon cemetery. The student demonstrators buried U Thant on the former grounds of the Rangoon University Students Union (RUSU), which Ne Win had dynamited and destroyed on July 8 1962.

During the period of December 5 through December 11 1974, the student demonstrators also built a temporary mausoleum for U Thant on the grounds of the RUSU and gave anti-government speeches. In the early morning hours of December 11, 1974, government troops stormed the campus, killed some of the students guarding the make-shift mausoleum, removed U Thant's coffin, and reburied it at the foot of the Shwedagon Pagoda, where it has continued to lie.

Upon hearing of the storming of the Rangoon University campus and the forcible removal of U Thant's coffin, many people rioted in the streets of Rangoon. Martial law was declared in Rangoon and the surrounding metropolitan areas. What has come to be known as the U Thant crisis — the student-led protests over the shabby treatment by the Ne Win government of U Thant — was crushed by the Burmese government.

In 1978, U Thant's memoirs "View from the UN" was published, by the American publishing house Doubleday.

Javier Pérez de Cuéllar Guerra (born January 19, 1920 in Lima) is a Peruvian diplomat who was the fifth Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1 1982 to December 31 1991. He studied in Colegio San Agustín of Lima, and then at Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú.

In 1995, he ran unsuccessfully against Alberto Fujimori for President of Peru. He was President of the Council of Ministers, as well as Minister of Foreign Affairs from November 2000 until July 2001, during the turbulent period following Fujimori's resignation over corruption charges. In September 2004, he stepped down from his position as Peru's Ambassador to France. When Kurt Waldheim died in June 2007, he became the oldest living former Secretary General of the United Nations.

Pérez de Cuéllar joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1940 and the diplomatic service in 1944, serving subsequently as Secretary at Peru's embassies in France, where he met and married his first wife, the former Yvette Roberts; the United Kingdom, Bolivia, and Brazil. He later served as ambassador to Switzerland, the Soviet Union, (concurrently in Poland), and Venezuela. From his first marriage, Mr. Perez de Cuellar has a son, (Francisco, b. Paris), and a daughter, Agueda Cristina (b. London).

He was a junior member of the Peruvian delegation to the General Assembly at its first session - held in London in 1946-, and a member of the delegations to the 25th through 30th sessions of the Assembly. In 1971, he was appointed permanent representative of Peru to the United Nations, and he led his country's delegation to all sessions of the Assembly from then until 1975.

In 1973 and 1974, he represented his country in the Security Council, serving as its President at the time of the events in Cyprus in July 1974. On 18 September 1975, he was appointed Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Cyprus – a post he held until December 1977-, when he rejoined the Peruvian Foreign Service. During his time in Cyprus, Mr. Perez de Cuellar married his current wife, the former Marcela Temple Seminario.

On December 31 1981, Pérez de Cuéllar followed Kurt Waldheim as Secretary-General and was re-elected for a second term in October 1986. During his two terms, he led mediations between Britain and Argentina in the aftermath of the Falklands War and promoted the efforts of the Contadora Group to bring peace and stability to Central America. He also interceded in the negotiations for the independence of Namibia, the conflict in Western Sahara between Morocco and the Polisario Front, and the Cyprus issue.

Shortly before the end of his second term, he was unofficially requested by members of the Security Council to run for a third term of two years,to give time for a successor to be found.

Boutros Boutros-Ghali

Boutros Boutros-Ghali (Arabic: بطرس بطرس غالي, Coptic: Bουτρος Βουτρος-Γαλι) (born November 14, 1922) is an Egyptian diplomat who was the sixth Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1992 to December 1996.

He had long been closely associated with the ruling party in Egypt. His political career took off during the days of former president Anwar El-Sadat. He was a member of the Central Committee of the Arab Socialist Union (1974-77). He had served as Egypt's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs from 1977 until early 1991. He then became Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs for several months before moving to the UN. As Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, he played a part in the peace agreements between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.

Elected to the top post of the UN in 1991, Boutros-Ghali's term in office remains controversial. He was criticised for the UN's failure to act during the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, which officially left about 937,000 people dead, and he appeared unable to muster support in the UN for intervention in the continuing Angolan Civil War. One of the hardest periods for his office during his term was dealing with the crisis of the Yugoslav wars after the disintegration of former Yugoslavia. His reputation thus became entangled in the larger controversies over the effectiveness of the UN and the role of the United States in the UN. For his detractors, he came to symbolise the UN's alleged inaction in the face of humanitarian crises.

In 1996, ten Security Council members, led by African members Egypt, Guinea-Bissau and Botswana, sponsored a resolution backing Boutros-Ghali for a second five-year term, until the year 2001. However, the United States vetoed a second term for Boutros-Ghali. In addition to the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, South Korea, and Italy did not sponsor this resolution, although all four of those nations voted in support of Boutros-Ghali after the US had firmly declared its intention to veto. Although not the first vetoed (China vetoed the third term of Kurt Waldheim in 1981), Boutros-Ghali was the first and only UN secretary-general not to be elected to a second term in office. He was succeeded at the UN by Kofi Annan.

US counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarke, Michael Sheehan, and Jamie Rubin participated in what they called "Operation Orient Express." From page 201 of Clarke's book Against All Enemies: "Albright and I and a handful of others (Michael Sheehan, Jamie Rubin) had entered into a pact together in 1996 to oust Boutros-Ghali as Secretary General of the United Nations, a secret plan we had called Operation Orient Express, reflecting our hope that many nations would join us in doing in the UN head. In the end, the US had to do it alone (with its UN veto) and Sheehan and I had to prevent the President from giving in to pressure from world leaders and extending Boutros-Ghali's tenure, often by our racing to the Oval Office when we were alerted that a head of state was telephoning the President. In the end Clinton was impressed that we had managed not only to oust Boutros-Ghali but to have Kofi Annan selected to replace him. (Clinton told Sheehan and me, 'Get me a crow, I should eat a crow, because I said you would never pull it off.')"

From 1997 to 2002 Boutros-Ghali was Secretary-General of La Francophonie, an organisation of French-speaking nations. From 2003 to 2006, he served as the Chairman of the Board of the South Centre, intergovernmental research organisation of developing countries. He is currently President of the Curatorium Administrative Council at the Hague Academy of International Law. In 2003 Boutros-Ghali was appointed as The Director of the Egyptian National Council of Human Rights, he is still holding this position till today.

Since April 2007 Boutros-Ghali has supported the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly and was one of the initial signatories of the Campaign's appeal. In a message to the Campaign, he stressed the necessity to establish democratic participation of citizens at the global level.

Boutros-Ghali has published two memoirs:

José Saramago

José de Sousa Saramago, (pronounced|ʒuˈzɛ sɐɾɐˈmagu; born November 16, 1922; died June 18, 2010) was a Portuguese writer, playwright and journalist.

Saramago was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1998. He lived on Lanzarote in the Canary Islands, Spain.

Saramago was born into a family of landless peasants in Azinhaga, Portugal, a small village in the province of Ribatejo some hundred kilometers north-east of Lisbon.

Saramago married Ilda Reis in 1944. Their only child, Violante, was born in 1947. Since 1988, Saramago has been married to the Spanish journalist Pilar del Río, who is the official translator of his books into Spanish.

José Saramago was in his mid-fifties before he had international success; his novel "Baltasar and Blimunda" brought him an international readership. This novel won the Portuguese PEN Club Award.

Saramago was a member of the Portuguese Communist Party from 1969, until his death as well as an atheist and self-described pessimist. His views have aroused considerable controversy in Portugal, especially after the publication of "The Gospel According to Jesus Christ".

Saramago uses for his works fantastic scenarios. In his 1986 novel, "The Stone Raft", the Iberian Peninsula breaks off from the rest of Europe and sails about the Atlantic Ocean. In his 1995 novel, "Blindness", an entire country is stricken with a mysterious plague called “white blindness”.

Finntroll

Finntroll is a folk metal band from Finland. They mix elements of extreme metal with Finnish polka, called "humppa". Finntroll's lyrics are in Swedish, one of Finland's two national languages, because they say "Swedish just sounds damn trollish". Finntroll means "Troll from Finland" or "a spotty troll".

Finntroll was founded in 1997, by Teemus Raimoranta. One year later they recorded their first demo, "Rivfader". After the demo Samu Ruotsalainen (drums),Samuli Ponsimaa (guitar), Henri Sorvali (keyboard) and Sami Uusitalo joined the band. The record company Spinefarm got interested in the band and then their first album "Midnattens Widunder" was recorded.
In 2001 the album "Jaktens Tid" (English: "The time of the Hunt") was released. As they became more and more popular, Century Media started to promote Finntroll. That summer Finntroll played their first open air festivals in Finland. The year after the release of the album "Jaktens Tid" the band could not go on tour, because their singer had a tumor in his vocal cords. That is why he stopped singing in the band after the album "Visor om Slutet" (English: "Songs about the End"). This album was recorded in January 2003, in a forest cabin near Helsinki. Shortly before the release of "Visor om Slutet" Raimoranta died, because he fell of a bridge in Helsinki. He had drunk too much alcohol. Finntroll went on tour to Europe anyway, together with the band Katatonia. The guitarist Mikael Karlbom replaced Raimoranta. In 2004, the band released an EP, "Trollhammaren" (English: "The Troll Hammer"), and an album called "Nattfödd" (English: "Nightborn").

On January 29th, 2006, Tapio Wilska, vocalist of the band since 2003, left the band.

A new album, called Ur Jordens Djup (English: "From the Depths of the Earth"), was released March, 2007. This album had more epic keyboard riffs to make it sound more like polka.

Rural Districts of Germany

In Germany a Rural District, () is a level of local government about the same as a county in the United Kingdom.

Urban districts are large towns or cities which handle their own local government. Rural districts provide services for the smaller towns and villages in an area. In some states the towns and villages in a district are joined into ämter (although "amt" is not always the name used). This is because the towns and villages in the area are too small to provide the local services (for example fire brigade or cemeteries). If the "Amt" system is used towns or settlements might be "amtfrei" that is, not part of an amt because the town can handle its own local affairs.

In some states there is another level of government, the Regierungsbezirk or governmental district. Several urban and rural districts are joined together to make a regierungsbezirk, which does some of their jobs, especially things like land-use planning which can affect several districts.

Ratchet &amp; Clank (video game)

Ratchet & Clank is a platforming and shooting game for the PlayStation 2. It was made by Insomniac Games and published by Sony. It was released on November 7, 2002 in North America, November 8, 2002 in Europe, and December 3, 2002 in Japan. It is the first game in the Ratchet & Clank series.

The game is about the character Ratchet, a made-up animal called a Lombax, and his robot friend Clank. Ratchet and Clank travel around the galaxy to defeat an evil alien named Chairman Drek, who is trying to destroy planets. The player is able to use many weapons and machines to attack enemies and solve puzzles.

In this game, the player plays as Ratchet most of the time, but can play as Clank sometimes. Ratchet can use lots of weapons and gadgets to attack enemies, solve puzzles, and jump over gaps. Clank can control smaller robots called "Gadgebots" who do things for him that Clank can not do on his own. There are lots of different places the player can go to. 

A factory making lots of big robots is seen. One day a small robot is made by accident. He sees a video of an alien leader called Drek. Drek wants to break up lots of planets, and then use the pieces to make a new planet for his people, because his people'sold planet has become too polluted to live in. The video scares the robot, and he gets away in a spaceship, but crashes on a made-up planet called Veldin.

Ratchet is a made-up animal called a Lombax, who lives on Veldin. He wants to leave Veldin in his spaceship, and have adventures. Ratchet finds the small robot and calls him "Clank". Clank wants to stop Drek, and wants Ratchet to help him find a superhero called Captain Qwark, who he thinks will stop Drek. Clank fixes Ratchet's ship, so that Ratchet will help him.

Later on, Ratchet and Clank find Qwark. But Qwark is working for Drek, and he tries to kill Ratchet and Clank. They both get away from Qwark, but Ratchet is angry at Clank. Clank wants to stop Drek, but Ratchet only wants to find Qwark and kill him.

Soon, Ratchet shoots down Qwark's spaceship. After this happens, he sees a video with Drek's army destroying a city. The video makes Ratchet feel bad, and he says sorry to Clank for not helping him to find Drek.

They soon find out that Drek has a weapon called the "Deplanetizer". He is going to destroy Veldin, Ratchet's home, and this makes Ratchet angry. They find Drek, but he tells them he only did he whole thing to get money. People bought parts of his new planet, and Drek has made lots of money. But after the whole planet has been bought, he is going to pollute it. Then he will have to make another new planet, and get lots more money. But Ratchet and Clank kill Drek after a long fight, and use the Deplanetizer to destroy Drek's new planet. This makes lots of rocks fall down to Veldin. Clank gets his arm hurt, and Ratchet asks if he wants it fixed, and they both walk away together.

Pollyanna

Pollyanna is a book for children written by Eleanor Hodgman Porter. It was published in 1913.

A girl called Pollyanna is an orphan (her parents are dead). She goes to live with her Aunt Polly (who did not marry) in Beldingsville, Vermont. Pollyanna is happy all the time, and makes other people happy. She plays a game called the "glad game", where you find something to be happy about even when you are sad. Soon, everyone in the town is happy. But then Pollyanna falls out of a tree and she is sad because she cannot walk. She has to learn to be happy again, and then she gets better because a doctor makes her well again. Aunt Polly and the doctor marry.

Miss Polly Harrington is known around town for being a stern, hard woman who is set in her ways. So it is only a sense of duty that causes her to Pollyanna, her newly orphaned niece. But Pollyanna is a very special little girl, with a very special game that she teaches to the town's people. Soon, everyone in town is happier, and glad that Pollyanna came into their lives—everyone that is but Aunt Polly H. But then a terrible accident threatens to ruin her game forever and everybody wonders who can teach this little girl to be glad again and that is only Dr. Chilton, Ms. Polly's ex-lover.

If someone is called "Pollyanna", it means they are always happy like Pollyanna is. The "Pollyanna principle" means people say yes to positive statements (For example, instead of "What do you think of green?", you can say "Don't you agree that green is a nice colour?").

Pollyanna was an irrepressibly, cheerful child. So cheerful that her name survives in any standard American Dictionary. - 'an excessively or blindly optimistic person.'

Middle Chinese (), or "Ancient Chinese" as used by linguist Bernhard Karlgren is a name given to an older version of the Chinese language. People spoke it during Southern and Northern Dynasties and the Sui, Tang, and Song dynasties (6th century - 10th century). The term "Middle Chinese", in contrast to Old Chinese and Modern Chinese, is usually used for historical Chinese phonology, which wants to reconstruct the pronunciation of Chinese used during these times.

Middle Chinese can be divided further. There was an early period and a later period. These can be told apart by the pronunciation of certain sounds that changed.

Mecklenburg-Strelitz Duchy

Mecklenburg-Strelitz was a duchy and later grand duchy in northern Germany. It was about the same as the modern rural district of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The duchy also had three exclaves near the town of Fürstenberg and the area around Ratzeburg in modern Schleswig-Holstein. 

The Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was set up in 1701. The capital was Neustrelitz. In 1808, the duchy joined the Confederation of the Rhine. The Congress of Vienna made it a grand duchy and member of the German Confederation. Mecklenburg-Strelitz joined the North German Confederation in 1867, and became a part of the German Empire in 1871. On January 1 1934 it was joined with the neighbouring state of Mecklenburg-Schwerin to form the State of Mecklenburg (today part of the federal state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern).

The US county Mecklenburg (Charlotte, North Carolina) is named after Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Strelitz-born Princess Charlotte (queen consort of King George III of the United Kingdom). The flower "Strelitzia" ("Bird of Paradise") also is in honor of her home country. Queen Luise of Prussia also was a born princess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

Household Cavalry

The British Household Cavalry, is an army corps (pronounced "core") of two regiments of soldiers. Cavalry regiments, until the end of World War I, were always "mounted" on horses. Nowadays "cavalry regiments" are mounted on tanks. The British Household Cavalry is unusual because half of them are also still mounted on horses. The two Regiments of Household Cavalry, the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, which parades with horses and the Household Cavalry Regiment, which is equipped with light armoured vehicles, are manned by equal numbers of soldiers from The Life Guards and The Blues and Royals both of which are part of the "Household Division". In Britain the "Household Division" has the special privilege of guarding the Sovereign and the Royal Household. The term "Household Division" is used in all Commonwealth countries. 

In many other countries there are similar highly-trained army corps which guard the head of state and have ceremonial duties as well as operational military roles. Regiments of this sort can be found in Australia, Brunei, Belgium, Canada, Denmark and many other countries. But when speaking in English of the "Household Cavalry", the term generally refers to the "British Household Cavalry". 

In Britain there are seven regiments in the Household Division. They are generally referred to as "The Guards". Five of the Guards regiments are "infantry", which means that they are "foot soldiers" and are Foot Guards, and the senior two regiments are "cavalry" meaning they are first and foremost armoured soldiers who also have a ceremonial role "mounted" on horses for ceremonial duty. 

The British Household Cavalry is made of two regiments: The Life Guards and The Blues and Royals. They are the senior regular regiments in the British Army, with traditions dating from 1660. The "Horse Guards", (as they are known, for short), have their barracks in Hyde Park Barracks in Knightsbridge in London and perform their principal duty of forming daily The Queen's Life Guard at a building in London which was formerly the headquarters of the British Army. There are always mounted guards on duty ouside the "Horse Guards" building in front of which lies the famous Horse Guards Parade where The Queen's Birthday Parade takes place. There, the daily ceremony of the "Changing of The Queen's Life Guard" takes place. (This is a different Changing of the Guard to the one at Buckingham Palace.) 
The Colonel-in-Chief of both Regiments of Household Cavalry is Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The Colonel of The Life Guards is General Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank GCB, LVO, OBE. The Colonel of The Blues and Royals is Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal KG, KT, GCVO, QSO. 

The motto of both regiments is "Honi Soit Qui Mal Y Pense" (Shame on him who thinks evil of it). 

As military regiments, The Life Guards and The Blues and Royals have served in these places:

The ceremonial uniform of the Household Cavalry has two features that are not often seen on other soldiers. They wear a shiny brass helmet, with a long "plume" of horse hair hanging from the top. When on "mounted guard" duty they also wear a "cuirasse" (metal chest armour). The two regiments can be told apart by the colour of their jacket (which is called a "tunic") and by the "plumes" on their helmets. The Life Guards wear red tunics with white plumes while The Blues and Royals wear blue tunics and have red plumes to their helmets. While on guard, the soldiers carry swords. When mounted on horses, the soldiers wear white riding-breeches, known as buckskins, and tall black winged leather boots, which are called jack boots, having been "jacked" or reinforced against sword blows (Fr. Jaque: chainmail). 

The "farrier" assists the Regimental Veterinary Officer in of taking care of the horses. When the farrier is mounted on parade, he carries the traditional symbol of an axe. In battle, one of the farrier's jobs was to kill horses that were badly injured. They also had to cut off one of the hooves so that there was proof of the horse's death so that a new one could be purchased. The horses are all black three quareter bred Irish draught horses except for the trumpeters' horses, which are grey, and the drumhorses which are large draught horses. They are almost invariably coloured horses, Shires or Clydesdales and are "piebald" (black and white), "skewbald" (brown and white) or roan. The drumhorses each carry two solid silver kettle drums on parade.

The trumpeter, whose job is to relay messages by trumpet, can be told apart because he does not wear a cuirrass, and has a grey (white) horse. On "State occasions" when The Queen or another member of the Royal Family is present, the bands of The Household Cavalry wear gold coats designed at the time of King Charles II made of gold braid and dark blue velvet jockey hats. Each regiment has its own Quick March and Slow March. They both use a Scottish tune the "Keel Row" for a ceremonial "trot past".

The Household Cavalry Regiment is an armoured reconnaissance regiment based in Windsor. Most Household Cavalry soldiers begin their careers on mounted duty before being posted, normally after about two years at ceremonial duty, to the reconnaissance regiment, which is equipped with Scimitar light tanks, where they are trained in driving, gunnery ands signals. This regiment has deployed more than almost any other in the British Army to operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan. Gallantry medals awarded to soldiers of the Household Cavalry since 2003 include: a George Cross (GC) to Trooper Christopher Finney of The Blues and Royals, a Conspicuous Gallantry Cross (CGC) and a Military Cross (MC) to Staff Corporal Michael Flynn of The Blues and Royals (making him the most decorated serviceman in the British Army), a CGC to Lance Corporal of Horse Andrew Radford, a Distinguished Service Order to Major Richard Taylor of The Life Guards, and MCs to Captain Paddy Williams of The Blues and Royals and to Staff Corporal Shaun Fry of The Life Guards. All these were awarded on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Camillo Berneri

Camillo Berneri (also known as Camillo da Lodi; 1877, Lodi—May 5 1937, Barcelona) was an Italian professor of philosophy, anarchist militant, propagandist and theorist.

Berneri, a World War I veteran, University of Florence professor of humanities, and a member of the Unione Anarchica Italiana, fought always Fascists, and he started to fight fascism until1926, when he was forced to escape from Italy and he went in France, then Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, and finally the Netherlands. In all these countries, Berneri was frequently placed under arrest, and then often expelled, because he was an anarchist. When he was in these countries he wrote lot of anti-clerical and anti-fascist articles.

With Carlo Rosselli, Berneri organized the first troop (column) of Italian volunteers to fight in the Spanish Civil War against Francisco Franco. After months he became highly critical of the involvement of Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) members in the Popular Front government, and he sent a letter to Federica Montseny (Anarchist minister for Healt in the government against fascism).

During the Barcelona May Days, as troop of Communist Party of Spain members (apparently under orders from Joseph Stalin) searched and than murdered him. His body, riddled with bullets, was found during the night, near the headquarters of the Generalitat de Catalunya.

He was married to Giovanna Berneri, and was father of Marie-Louise Berneri and Giliane Berneri, the children's were anarchists as the father Camillo.

Scenario

In context with theatre and movies a scenario (from Italian, "that which is pinned to the ") is a description of an event or series of actions and events. In the "Commedia dell'arte" it was an outline of entrances, exits, and action describing the story of a play that was literally pinned to the back of the scenery. 

Surviving scenari from the Renaissance contain little other than character names, brief descriptions of action, and references to specific lazzi with no further explanation. It is believed that a scenario forms the basis of a fully improvisational performance though it is also likely that they were simple reminders of the plot for those members of the cast who were literate. 

In the creation of an opera or ballet, a scenario is often developed initially to indicate how the original source, if any, is to be adapted. This sketch can be helpful in "pitching" the idea to a prospective producer, director, or composer.

In policy planning and, generally, when organizations wish to test strategies against uncertain future developments, a scenario is also an account or synopsis of a projected course of action, events or situations. Scenarios are widely used by organizations of all types to understand different ways that future events might unfold.

Lev Chernyi

Lev Chernyi (18??-1921) was a Russian anarchist poet who was imprisoned in Siberia under the Russian Czarist regime for his revolutionary activities. 

In 1907, he published a book entitled "Associational Anarchism", in which he speak about the "free association of independent individuals.". Chernyi was greatly influenced by individualist-anarchist Max Stirner.

On his return from Siberia in 1917 he enjoyed great popularity among Moscow workers. He was also Secretary of the Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups, which was formed in March, 1917. 

In the spring of 1918, in reaction to the growing repression of all opposition and free expression, the anarchist groups within the Moscow Federation formed armed gangs, the Black Guards, and Lev Chernyi played an active part in these. 

On the night of April 11, 1918 the Cheka, the secret police, attacked the building of the Moscow Federation, and the Black Guards offered armed resistance. About forty anarchists were killed or striked and about five hundred were imprisoned. 

In 1919 Chernyi joined a group called the Underground Anarchists, who published two numbers of a broadsheet which denounced the Communist dictatorship as the biggest tyranny in human history. On September 25, 1919, a little group of social revolutionaries and anarchists bombed the headquarters of the "Moscow Committee" of the Communist Party in protest at the growing repression. Twelve Communists were killed and forty-five others were mutilated. 

August, 1921, the Moscow "Izvestia" published an official report announcing that ten "anarchist bandits" had been shot without hearing or trial. Among the dead was Lev Chernyi although Paul Avrich indicates in two of his books on the Russian anarchists that Chernyi was executed in September of that year, not August. Although he was not involved in the bombing of the Moscow Communist headquarters, he was, because of his association with the Underground Anarchists, a likely candidate for a frame-up. The Communists refused to turn over his body to his family for burial, and there were persistent rumors that he had in fact died of torture.

Francisco Ferrer y Guardia

Francesc Ferrer y Guàrdia (January 10 1859 - October 12 1909), (known as Francisco Ferrer i Guardia in Englishpr shortly Francisco Ferrer), was a Spanish Catalan "free-thinker" and anarchist.

He was born in Alella (a small town near Barcelona). A supporter of Spanish republican leader Ruiz Zorilla, Ferrer was exiled to Paris with his wife and children in 1885. Divorcing his first wife in 1899, he remarried a wealthy Parisian teacher some time after.

In 1901 he returned to Spain and opened la Escuela Moderna ("The Modern School") to teach middle-class children (then) radical social values, the school was free. In 1906 he was arrested and accused of helping with Mateu Morral's attack on King Alphonso XIII and released a year later. His school failed and closed while he was incarcerated.

Early in the summer of 1908, after his release from jail, he wrote the story of the Modern School. The book was called "The Origins and Ideals of the Modern School" and was translated into English by Joseph McCabe and published by the Knickerbocker Press in 1913.

When the martial law was reused in 1909 during the Tragic Week, he was arrested and executed without any proof by firing squad at Montjuich Fortress in Barcelona on October 13.

After his execution, numerous supporters of Ferrer's ideas in the United States formed what were called Modern Schools, or Ferrer Schools. The first and most important Modern School was formed in New York City in 1911, and then later a community was founded around a school, known as Ferrer Colony and Modern School.

Gaetano Bresci

Gaetano Bresci (November 11, 1869 - May 22, 1901) was an Italian American anarchist who killed Italian King Umberto I. He is still considered a hero by many anarchists and republicans.

Bresci was born in Tuscany, and he went from Italy to the United States, he lived for many time Paterson, New Jersey, where there was a large Italian-American community. He was one of the founders of "La Questione Sociale", the Italian language anarchist paper published in Paterson. 

In 1898, the high bread prices led to demonstrations all over Italy. In Milan, an unarmed group of workers, women and children marched together for protesting, near the palace, which was surrounded by a strong military force under command of General Fiorenzo Bava-Beccaris. The people ignored the order to stop, so the General gave the signal of fire with rifles and cannons, resulting in a massacre of innocent people. Ninety people died, one of whom was Bresci's sister.

King Humbert later decorated Bava-Beccaris, and the king after said thanks to him,for "the defense of the royal house"",the king did not do anything for the innocent people died, he decorated the murtder, this is the reason that made Bresci determined to kill the king.Bresci had his loan to the paper returned (without telling his comrades why), and with the money he went to Italy. In Monza, where the king was visiting on July 29, 1900, he shot him three times.

Bresci was captured and put on trial, where he was defended by the anarchist lawyer Francesco Saverio Merlino. He was sentenced in Milan on August 29, 1900, to life imprisonment on the jail of Santo Stefano Island near Ventotene, where lot of other anarchists had also been sent over the years. Less than a year later he was found dead in prison. It is not clear whether he committed suicide, as officially announced, or whether he was murdered by his guards.

Diode

A diode is an electronic component with two electrodes which a signal can flow between (but thermionic diodes can have one or two more electrodes).

The most common function of a diode is to allow an electric current to flow in one direction and to block it in the opposite direction.

Today, the most common diodes are made from semiconductor materials such as silicon or germanium.

Here are some common semiconductor diode symbols used in schematic diagrams:
The first types of diodes were called Fleming valves. They worked inside a glass tube (much like a light bulb). Inside the glass bulb there was a small metal wire and a large metal plate. The small metal wire would heat up and emit electricity, which was captured by the plate. However, the large metal plate would not heat up enough to emit electricity because it was too big. So, electricity could go in one direction through the tube but not in the reverse direction. Flemming valves are mostly obsolete now, because they have been replaced by semiconductor diodes.

Semiconducting diodes are usually made of two types of semiconducting metals connected to each other. One type of metal has atoms connected together with a few electrons to spare. The other metal has atoms connected together and needs a few electrons to be complete. Because one metal has too many electrons and the other metal has too few, the electricity will flow easily from the metal with too many electrons into the metal with too few. However, electricity will not flow easily in the reverse direction -- from the metal with too few electrons to the metal with too many. Silicon with arsenic dissolved in it makes a good metal with electrons to spare, while silicon with aluminum dissolved in it makes a good metal with too few electrons to be complete. There are actually many types of combinations of metals that will make p-type and n-type semiconductors.

If you give positive voltage to the p-side and negative voltage to the n-side, the electrons from the n-side will want to go to the positive voltage at the p-side and the holes of the p-side will want to go to the negative voltage at the n-side. Because of this, current flow is able to exist. This is called breakdown. The breakdown voltage of a silicon diode is at about 0.7 V. A germanium diode needs a breakdown voltage at about 0.3 V.

If you give negative voltage to the p-side and positive voltage to the n-side, the electrons of the n-side go to the negative voltage at the n-side. The holes of the p-side go to the positive voltage at the p-side. So there will not be a current flow between p- and n-side. If you give too much voltage to the diode in negative direction, the diode will be destroyed.

When the temperature increases, the voltage needed for the breakdown to happen goes down.

The standard rectifier diode is the actual original diode. It has different requirements. It should have high current densities in the forward area, and a high barrier permissible temperature. It should also have a minimum passing-voltage and a high cut-off-frequency. You should also have a high blocking voltage, whereby the blocking flows should remain low.
Their applications are the whole modern analog and digital electronics. Especially it becomes straightening of changing and turning tension, and to limit power supply voltage used. The diode is often needed for measurement and drive. 

The Z-diode (Zener diode) operates in the direction lock and so the direction of their work area is located in the 3rd Quadrant. In working towards the passage it is like a normal diode. The name comes from Zenereffekt, the man with the name Zener discovered. The term Z-diode is only a shortcut. A Z-diode can vary how high it is doped and then has different properties breakthrough. With a high allocation to the diode it has a low and a small space charge zone. Is it high, it works with Zener \ tunneleffect. At low doping, it has a large breakdown voltage and space charge zone and works with the avalanche effect. For medium-doping is the breakdown voltage 5-8 volts and there are two effects.
Z-diodes are best suited to stabilize voltage for circuits with low power consumption. But the limitation of voltage spikes is a possibility to use it. With appropriate Zener voltage they can be used as donors in nominal value of measuring and control technology, or where reference voltages are required. It can also be used as a protective diode.

Top diodes are actually the exact opposite of junction diodes. They have a small barrier layer capacity and are also in high-frequency applications up to several GHz. But they must ensure only at low currents and voltages to operate. As a particular example the gold wire germanium diode is mentioned.
Junction diodes have a p-n-transition over a large area and are often made of silicon. They are designed for high currents and voltages. Because they have a pretty big barrier layer capacity, they are not suitable for high frequency applications. A specific example of the application is called the power diode. 

The capacity diode is a semiconductor diode barrier in the direction of running, so does the barrier layer or space charge zone on pn-transition as a capacity. If the voltage on the diode is changing, then the capacity of the barrier will change, too. Then you look at the capacity diode you see the barrier layer capacity is especially great. Because of the capacity variation can be set 3 different p-n-transitions. With a 1:3 ratio, it is a linear transition, in an abrupt 1:6 and 1:30 a hyper-abrupt p-n-transition. 
They are used as a substitute for rotary capacitors for the swing vote in the district of radios and televisions, and they will also find use in circuits for the generation of frequency modulation.

The symbol of this diode is the usual symbol of a diode with a kind of snag.
It is especially used in circuits with high frequencies up to GHz.
The idea is, to work with the current that flows after the polarity was reversed. It has also an intrinsic layer between the p- and the n-layer. After the polarization has changed, there develops a layer without carriers. That means, there is a layer that is almost not conducting. So you can achieve a high slew rate.
This diode is used with high gigahertz-frequencies.

This diode has no special symbol.
The construction of this diode is, that there´s not only a pn-junction, but also an intrinsic layer between the n- and the p-layer. This means, this layer is nearly nonconducting. If it´s forward biased, especially at lower frequencies, it has almost the same characteristics as a usual standard diode. But if it runs in reverse direction, there develops two space charge regions with different extensions. Because of this broad space charge region in the i-zone, the i-zone becomes very conductive.
The pin-diode is useful for a high block voltage. It´s a quite fast diode and also used at very high frequencies.

The symbol if this diode is the usual symbol with a ‘S’ at the peak.
It consists of a pn-junction with a metal layer, which is oxidized on the n-doped silicon.
This metal can be e.g. aluminum or nickel.
In forward direction, the threshold voltage is about 0.3 volt. This is about half of the threshold voltage of a usual diode.
The function of this diode is that no minority carriers are injected.
So, there´s no diffusion capacitance, because there are no carriers, that could diffuse.
This explains why this diode is a very fast one. So it is always used, when speed plays a role.
The advantage of this diode is, that it is faster, but has otherwise no restrictions and works like a usual diode.
The only disadvantage is, it isn´t appropriate in reverse direction.

In the symbol of the tunnel diode there´s a kind of additional square bracket at the end of the usual symbol.
A tunnel diode consists of a high doped pn-junction. That means both, the n- and the p-layer are high doped. Because of this high doping, there is only a very narrow gap, where the electrons are able to pass through. This so called tunnel-effect appears in both directions.
After a certain amount of electrons have passed, the current through the gap decreases, until the normal current through the diode at the threshold voltage begins.
This causes an area of a negative differential resistance.
These diodes are used to deal with really high frequencies (100 GHz) and are of course mostly used in the area of the negative differential resistance.

The symbol has at the end of the diode a sign that looks like a big I.
This diode has a construction that is similar to the tunnel diode, but the n- and the p-layer aren´t doped as high.
It works with small negative voltages, because it has no threshold voltage in the third quadrant. The current increases immediately, there.
From this reason, this diode works in most times in this area.

Pomp and Circumstance Marches

The "Pomp and Circumstance Marches" are a group of five marches for orchestra composed by Sir Edward Elgar. Their full title is: "Pomp and Circumstance Military Marches"). Elgar started to write a sixth march, but never finished it.

The first of the marches is especially famous and has a tune which is one of the best known tunes in Britain. It is often sung to the words " Land of Hope and Glory".

The title “Pomp and Circumstance”is taken from Act III, Scene iii of Shakespeare's "Othello":

The "Pomp and Circumstance" marches are

The first five were all published by Boosey & Co. as Elgar's Op. 39. Elgar dedicated each march to one of his musical friends.

Each march takes about five minutes to play.

" March No. 1 in D " is the best known of the set. It was completed, together with March No. 2, in 1901, soon after the first performance of his “Dream of Gerontius” which had been badly performed. Elgar dedicated it to Alfred Rodewald who conducted its first performance with the Liverpool Orchestra Society on 19 October 1901. Both marches were played two days later at a Promenade Concert in the Queen's Hall London, conducted by Henry Wood. Elgar knew that the audience would love the big tune in the middle of March No. 1, so that march was played second. Henry Wood tells in his autobiography that “the people simply rose and yelled. I had to play it again – with the same result; in fact, they refused to let me get on with the programme….merely to restore order, I played the march a third time.” 

The next year King Edward VII was due to be crowned in June. The King liked the big tune, and wanted it performed with words at the coronation. So Elgar used it at the end of his "Coronation Ode" with words by A.C. Benson. The coronation did not take place because the king became ill just before the big day. "Land of Hope and Glory" was sung in June 1902 by Clara Butt, and the whole Ode was performed in Sheffield four months later.

In Britain "Land of Hope and Glory" is sung every year at the Last Night of the Proms in the Royal Albert Hall as part of the Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1.

The words are:

In the United States the tune is sometimes known as "Pomp and Circumstance" or as "The Graduation March", and is played as the processional tune at high school and college graduation ceremonies.

" March No. 2 in A minor " was dedicated to the composer Granville Bantock". It was first performed at the same concert as March No. 1. It the shortest and simplest of the marches.

" March No. 3 in C minor " was finished in November 1904 and published in 1905. It was dedicated to Ivor Atkins". It was first performed on 8 March 1905, in the Queen's Hall, London, conducted by the composer. It sounds quite serious at first, then it becomes very energetic.

" March No. 4 in G " is very grand, like No. 1. Again there is a big tune in the middle. It was dedicated to Dr. G. Robertson Sinclair, the organist of Hereford Cathedral. It was first performed on 24 August 1907, in the Queen's Hall, London, conducted by Elgar himself.

" March No. 5 in C ", composed in 1930, was dedicated to Percy Hull, a friend from Hereford. It has some brilliant orchestral effects.

" March No. 6 in G minor " was started, but when Elgar died there were only sketches left. The musician Anthony Payne recently discovered some more sketches for it in the library of the Royal School of Church Music. He finished composing in the way that Elgar might have done, and the work was first performed on 2 August 2006 with Andrew Davis conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra at The Proms at Royal Albert Hall.

704 Interamnia

704 Interamnia is a very big asteroid. Scientists think it is 350 kilometers wide. Its mean distance from the Sun is 3.067 (AU). It was found on October 2, 1910 by Vincenzo Cerulli. It is named after the Latin name for Teramo, Italy, which is where Cerulli worked. It is the fifth heaviest asteroid after Ceres, Vesta, Pallas and Hygiea, and scientists think that it makes up 2.0% of the mass of the whole asteroid belt.

Although the biggest asteroid apart from the "big four", Interamnia is not studied a lot. 
It is easily the biggest of the F-type asteroids, but there exist very few details of what the inside is made of or shape and no lightcurve analysis has yet been done to find out the ecliptic coordinates of Interamnia's poles (and hence its axial tilt). Its apparently high bulk density (though subject to much error) suggests a very solid body entirely without internal porosity or traces of water. This also strongly suggests that Interamnia is big enough to have fully withstood all the collisions that have happened in the asteroid belt since the Solar System was made.

Its very dark surface and fairly far distance form the Sun means Interamnia can never be seen with 10x50 binoculars. At most oppositions its magnitude is around +11.0, which is less than the "minimum" brightness of Vesta, Ceres or Pallas. Even at a near-perihelion opposition its magnitude is only around +9.9, which is over four magnitudes lower than Vesta.

Its orbit is a bit more eccentric that of Hygiea (15% versus 12%) but is different because Hygiea's orbit is much more inclined and takes a bit shorter to complete one orbit. Another difference is that Interamnia's perihelion is at the other side of the perihelia of the "big four", so that at Interamnia at perihelion is actually closer to the Sun than Ceres and Pallas are at the same longitude. It is unlikely to collide with Pallas because their nodes are located too far apart, whilst although its nodes are located on the opposite side from those of Ceres, it is generally clear of Ceres when both cross the same orbital plane and a collision is again unlikely.

River Ocoa

The River Ocoa is a river in the southern side of the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic. It is 68 km long and flows through mountains except near its end in the Caribbean Sea.

Ocoa is a Taíno word that means "a place with mountains"; "coa" meant "place" and "o" meant, in some cases, "mountain".

The source of the Ocoa is at the La Chorreosa mountain (also known as La Chorriosa), on the eastern side of Valle Nuevo (Cordillera Central). It flows through the San José de Ocoa province and then form part of the limits between the Azua and Peravia provinces.

It ends at the eastern side of Ocoa Bay, on the Caribbean Sea.

The city of San José de Ocoa is the most important city near the river. Other towns are Las Carreras, Sabana Buey and Villa Fundación, in the Peravia province, and Palmar de Ocoa in the Azua province, near its mouth. The water of the river is used for irrigation in those towns; it is not used for the houses because it has too much solid materials because mountains have very few trees.

The most important tributaries are Banilejo, Canal and Arroyo Parra, all in the higher part of the river. There is not any important tributary in the lower part.

In the 16th century, sugar cane was grown near the mouth of the river to produce sugar.

On April 1849, there was an important battle (the "Battle of Las Carreras") here during the Dominican-Haitian War; the fight was on the western side of the river in Las Carreras, a place at about 20 km from the mouth. The Dominican army won the battle against the Haitian army.

Louise Michel

Louise Michel (1830-1905) was a French anarchist, school teacher and medical worker. She sometimes used the pseudonym "Clémence" and was also known as "the red virgin of Montmartre".

Louise Michel was born at the Château of Vroncourt (Haute-Marne) on 29 May 1830, the daughter of Marianne Michel, and of Etienne Charles Demahis. She was brought up by her father's parents, and received a libertaria education. After her grandfather's death in 1850 she was trained to teach, but after few times she saw that Napoleon III prevented her from serving in a state school. She became violently anti-Bonapartist, and is said to have thought about the assassination of Napoleon III. She became anarchist in 1866 to a school in the Montmartre quarter of Paris, where she saw that his destiny was to work for charity and follow the revolution.

She was active during the Paris Commune as an ambulance woman, she helped mutilated or injured on the barricades. During the Siege of Paris she was in resistance against the Prussians. On the establishment of the Commune, she joined the National Guard. She offered to shoot Thiers, and suggested the destruction of Paris for its surrender.

She was with the Communards who made their last stand in the cemetery of Montmartre, and was closely allied with Théophile Ferré, who was executed in November 1871. Michel dedicated a moving farewell poem to Ferré, "l’œillet rouge" ("The Red Carnation"). It is without a doubt that upon learning of this loss, Victor Hugo dedicated his poem to Michel, "Viro Major". This ardent attachment was perhaps one of the sources of the exaltation which marked her career, and gave many handles to her enemies. After December 1871, she was making propaganda, for help poor people,trying to destroy the government, and supporting people to arm themselves, and herself using weapons and wearing a military uniform. She never renounced the Commune, and few times later the judges to sentence her to death. She spent twenty months in prison and was sentenced to deportation.

She was pun onto the ship "Virginie" on the 8th of August, 1873, to be deported to New Caledonia where she arrived 4 months later. On board, she met Henri Rochefort, a famous polemist, who became her friend until her death. She also met Nathalie Lemel, another figure active in the commune. Louise rest in New Caledonia for seven years, refusing special treatment reserved for women. After in 1878 she was a leader in a revolt. The following year, she received authorisation to become a teacher in Noumea for the children of the deported—among them many Kabyles (Kabyles du Pacifique) from Cheikh Mokrani's rebellion (1871)—and later in schools for girls.

Michel returned to Paris in 1880 after amnesty was granted to the Communards. Her revolutionary never died and she controlled freely a libertarian school.She travelled everywhere in France, supporting revolution, and in 1883 she led a Paris mob which pillaged a baker's shop. For this she was condemned to six years imprisonment, but was released in 1886, at the same time as Kropotkin and other prominent anarchists. After a short period of freedom she was again arrested for speaking bad about the social system.

She was soon free again, but, hearing that her enemies hoped to put her in a lunatic asylum, she went to England in 1890. She returned to France in 1895, taking part in the revolt made by the Dreyfuss affair in 1898.Few months ago she was constantly followed by the police, until she died in "Room 11", in the Hotel Oasis, Marseilles on January 10, 1905.

Michel became highly admired by French workers and revolutionaries, particularly for her association with the Paris Commune. From after her death until 1916, a demonstration was held every year at her tomb at Levallois-Perret.Frequently, the language used to describe her is that reserved for saints and heretics; she is often referred to as ""Bonne Louise"" (Good Louise) or the ""Vierge rouge"" (red Virgin). She was always respected same in periods when women were without right.

On May 1, 1946, the Parisian "métro" station "Vallier" was renamed Louise Michel, see: Louise Michel (Paris Metro).

Catholic Encyclopedia

The Catholic Encyclopedia, or the Old Catholic Encyclopedia, is an English language encyclopedia. It was published by The Encyclopedia Press. The first volume appeared in March 1907. It was completed in April 1914.

The encyclopedia was designed for the Roman Catholic Church. It does not include information which has nothing to do with the Church. It explains matters from the point of view of the official Catholic doctrine, as it was during the time of Pope Pius X. It tells the accomplishments of Catholics and some others in nearly all intellectual and professional pursuits. These include artists, educators, poets and scientists.

<doc id="96023" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=96023" title="Numismatics">
Numismatics

Numismatics is the study and collecting of coins and the history behind the coins. A Numismatist is either a collector of coins or a scholar who studies the history of coins.

The term comes from a word meaning "of coins." The original word is French (numismatique), which itself is from a Latin origin (numismatis).

Coin collectors may have existed in ancient times. Caesar Augustus may have been an example. The first known book about coin collecting was in 1514, "De Asse et Partibus", by Guillaume Budé. However, only royalty really enjoyed coin collecting until the 19th century. That's when professional organizations started to sprout, like the American Numismatic Society in 1858.

Modern numismatics is a sub-field that focuses on when coins started being stamped by machines (around 17th century on). Because of its focus, modern numismatics is more popular with collectors than with historians. Other subfields/variants include exonumia (focus on coin-like objects), notaphily (focus on paper money instead of coins), and scripophily (focus on stocks and bonds instead of coins).

Leonidas I

Leonidas I was a king of Sparta. He was the 17th of the Agiad family of kings. His father was Anaxandridas II, who was thought to be a descendant of Heracles. He took the throne probably in 489 or 488 BC. His queen was Gorgo. Leonidas’ name is now very well known because of the battle of Thermopylae.
In 480 BC the Persians with their king Xerxes invaded Greece. When the united Greek forces invited the Spartans to join the rest of the army against the Persians, the Spartans went to the Oracle at Delphi. The Oracle gave a prophecy: either Sparta would fall or the Spartans would lose a king.

In August 480 BC, Leonidas went to Thermopylae with 300 of his personal bodyguards. Other Greek forces joined him there and formed an army of 4,200 soldiers. This army would try to hold the pass of Thermopylae against the great army of Xerxes I, who was the king of Persia.

Leonidas and his men held Thermopylae for 3 days. On the 3rd day a Greek traitor named Ephialtes led the Persian army behind the Spartans. It was then that Leonidas sent away all the Greek troops except 700 Thespians, who refused to leave the battlefield. The small Greek force was attacked from both sides. They fought hard but finally they were all killed. Xerxes told his men to cut Leonidas' head, put it on a stake and crucify his body. Now the only thing that reminds Leonidas is a monument near Leonidas’ death site, which carries the following inscription:

Only 2 Spartans survived. One was Kirtanian, who was injured and was sent behind the lines. The other one was Pantites, who was sent by Leonidas to raise support in Thessaly, but returned to Thermopylae only after the battle was finished. At the end, he hanged himself because he was called a coward.

Introduced species

An introduced species is an organism that is not native to a given place. It has brought there by human activities. This can cause problems because introduced species can damage the ecosystem they are introduced into. This damage can be to other animals, plants and also human activity.

An example of an introduced species is a fish, the tilapia. It comes from warm freshwater areas of Africa, North and South America, India and Sri Lanka. It has been taken to other areas because it is a good fish to farm, and it also is a good pet for an aquarium. When the fish is released into other parts of the world, it quickly takes over from the native fish. It can do this because it breeds quickly, eat all the available food, and eat the eggs and babies of native fish. This can cause the water to become muddy, and only the tilpia can keep living in these conditions. It has been listed as one of the 100 worst introduced species. A person owning or selling a tilapia in Australia could be fined up to AU$11,000.

Bunker

A bunker is a military building for defense. They are usually built below ground. Blockhouses are like bunkers, but are built above ground. Bunkers were of big importance during World War I and World War II. Bunkers were built during the Cold War for important political people and for the general public because of the scare of a nuclear war.

There are many different types of bunkers:

A trench is a small building made of concrete that is dug into the ground partway. These are usually parts of a big system of trenches. These kinds of bunkers give people fighting better protection than an open trench. They also give top protection against air attack (grenades, mortar fire and shells). They also provide shelter against the weather.

A pillbox is a small building made of concrete that also has small windows that people can shoot guns out of. The name came from the fact that they look like the boxes that pills came in.
Pillboxes were used a lot during World War I when defense in depth was being used. Pillboxes are most often found camouflaged so that they are harder to spot. They can also be part of a trench system, where the pillbox is a firing step that has been built to take grenade blasts and smaller mortar fire. Pillboxes were also built to help protect strategic structures such as bridges or jetties.

Industrial bunkers are built like regular bunkers and they can be mining sites, food storage areas, dumps for materials, data storage, and sometimes places that people live in. They were built by nations during World War II to help protect the important industries from getting bombed. Many mines in France and Germany were made into bunkers by both the Germans and the French in both World War I and World War II.

Famous bunkers include the World War II V-weapon buildings in Germany (e.g., Mittelwerk, La Coupole, and Éperlecques) and the Cold War buildings in the United States (Cheyenne Mountain, Site R, and The Greenbrier) and Canada (Diefenbunker).

Over harvesting

Over harvesting is an extreme use of some important areas like wetlands and damaging them without knowing that these areas could help many people. Most of wetlands that people destroy by overusing them could make drinking water for those people who do not have fresh water.

Over harvesting is also when you over harvest an animal to an extent were the population goes extremely low or even to extinction.

Habitat fragmentation

Habitat fragmentation happens when large habitats are divided into smaller ones, separating all the species that lived there and depended on each other. 

Habitat fragmentation is not good because it involves some amount of habitat destruction. Plants and other organisms in these areas are destroyed and mobile animals escape from those places to find another habitat causing an excessive crowding and possible competitions among different animals.

<doc id="96076" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=96076" title="Cecil (band)">
Cecil (band)

Cecil was a rock band from Liverpool, England. 

Cecil formed in Liverpool in 1993. The members were Ste Williams (vocals), Patrick Harrison (guitar), Ally Lambert (drums), Anthony Hughes (guitar and keyboards), and Jay Bennett (bass).

The band took part in a "Battle of the Bands". It was sponsored by Liverpool Echo who later tried to stitch the band up by putting them on the front cover under the title "Bulger Band", a reference to their song No Excuses that they believed, incorrectly, to be about the murder of toddler James Bulger. The band never spoke to the Liverpool Echo again. The band signed a manangement contract with Raymond Coffer. They later sign with the record label Parlophone (EMI). They released their first single "No Excuses" with Parlophone in October 1995.

The band spent the end of 1995 and most of 1996 playing concerts in much of the United Kingdom. They played with such bands as The Levellers, Skunk Anansie, and Paw. They also played in music festivals at Donnington and T in the Park. During this time, they released their second single "My Neck", which was backed with an acoustic track and a piano version of the single, giving a hint of the direction they were heading in for the recording of their 2nd record.

In 1996, their first album "Bombar Diddlah" was getting good reviews. It was produced by Barrett Jones of Foo Fighters.

Cecil spent most of 1997 writing songs, touring with the band Mansun and making their music sound even better. The changes could particularly be heard in the sound of Ste Williams' vocals. By the end of 1997, their new sound could be heard in their new release "Red Wine At Dead Time". They released a second album in 1998, "Subtitles". It did not sell as well as hoped. The band spent the next few years writing and touring sporadically, finally relocating to Seattle in 2001 to work on a third album with long time cohort Barrett Jones. After a productive 2 month stint, straight after the 9/11 bombings, the band went back home to write more songs and booked to go into Stone Gossard's (Pearl Jam) Studio Litho with Barrett to record the rest of the third record. This never happened after being dropped from their label.The band went their separate ways in March 2002 and remain firm friends, occasionally reuniting for off the cuff live shows in their native Liverpool.

Christopher Marlowe

Christopher "Kit" Marlowe (1564–30 May 1593) was a major dramatist, poet, and translator of English Renaissance drama. Many people believe he is the best Elizabethan tragedian before William Shakespeare.

Marlowe was the son of a shoemaker in Canterbury. His intelligence won him scholarships, to King's School in Canterbury at age 15, and two years later to the University of Cambridge. Marlowe was well-educated; he earned a bachelor's degree in 1584 and a master's degree in 1587. 

Marlowe's plays were both very popular and very controversial, in his own era and later too. His plays deal with disturbing subjects like devil worship ("Doctor Faustus"), homosexuality ("Edward II"), and anti-Semitism ("The Jew of Malta").

In addition to seven plays, Marlowe wrote one long poem, "Hero and Leander", and one famous shorter poem, "The Passionate Shepherd to His Love."

Marlowe's death was also highly controversial. He was killed in a tavern brawl, stabbed in the head. Yet there is some historical evidence that he was a secret agent. Marlowe also was, or sometimes claimed to be, an atheist, at a time when atheism was a crime that could be punished by death. Some people have wondered if his death was actually connected with these other issues.

Uncertainty about Marlowe's death has lead some people to believe that Marlowe faked his death and continued to write plays using the name "William Shakespeare." This is called the "Marlovian theory."

Bass clarinet

The bass clarinet is a type of clarinet, and is a woodwind single-reed instrument. The earliest record of a bass clarinet is called a 'bass tube' invented in Paris in 1772 by G. Lott. It usually has a B-flat pitch. It plays an octave lower than the normal clarinet. This means that when a Bass Clarinet makes a note, the note that actually sounds is a octave and a whole tone lower. There are some bass clarinets that have an A or C pitch as well as E flat, but there are not very many of these.

Baoruco Province

Baoruco, also written Bahoruco (but the "h" is not pronounced), is a Dominican province, in the western part of the country, in the "Hoya de Enriquillo" valley. Its capital city is Neiba (or Neyba).

It was created on 1943. It was part of the Barahona province before being elevated to the category of province. It was called Baoruco because the northern side of the Sierra de Bahoruco was part of the province; with the creation of the Independencia Province, that part went to the new province but the name was not changed.

Baoruco is bordered to the north by the San Juan province, to the east by the Azua and Barahona provinces, and to the south and west by the Independencia province.

In 2002 (last national census), there were 91,480 people living in the Baoruco province, and 49,530 (54.1%) living in towns and cities. The population density was 71.3 persons/km².

Its population represents 2.6% of the total population of the country and the province is ranked as the 24th (out of 31 plus the National District) more populated province.

The estimated population in the province for 2007 was of 102,817 inhabitants: 52,922 men and 49,895 women, for a population density of 80.2 persons/km².

The largest city of the province is Neiba, its head municipality or capital, with a population (in 2002) of 25,420 inhabitants.

Baoruco has a total area of 1,282.23 km². It has 2.6% of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 17th (out of 31 plus the National District) largest province.

The Baoruco province is in the "Hoya de Enriquillo" valley, a very dry valley with some parts below sea level; its capital, Neiba, has an elevation of only 10 m above sea level. In this valley is the "Lake Enriquillo", and the northeastern part of the lake, about of third of its surface, belongs to the Baoruco province, including its small islands of Barbarita and Islita.

The Sierra de Neiba runs across the northern part of the province, on the border with the San Juan province.

The most important river in the province is the Yaque del Sur River, one of the longest in the country; it forms the eastern limit of the province and its water is used for irrigation. Other rivers are Las Marías and Panzo.

The climate of the province is a tropical climate, very hot and dry in the valley, but it is cooler on the mountains. In the valley, cacti and other plants of dry regions are common. There are some rainforests in the mountains.

The only important road in the province goes through the southern part of the province, along the valley, and most important towns of the province are on this road.

There are five municipalities and nine municipal districts (M.D.) in the province. These are:

The main economic activity of the province is agriculture and the main products are plantain in Tamayo, grape in Neiba and Los Ríos. On the Sierra de Neiba, coffee and beans are important products.

Pectus excavatum

Pectus excavatum is a medical problem. The sternum (middle of the chest) is pushed into the chest. This makes the chest look sunken in. It is also called a "chest bowl" and a "dent".

Doctors do not know why some people have the dent. They think it might be caused by a bad gene from the parent. It is also linked to syndromes (illnesses) that effect other parts of the body.

Pectus excavatum happens in about 1 in every 150 children.

The dent can be fixed by a doctor. There are 4 different ways of fixing the chest:

The Nuss Prodcedure was created by Doctor Nuss from Norfolk in Virginia. A metal bar is put into the chest; the bar holds the chest up.

A vacuum bell, also called a suction cup, can be used to fix pectus excavatum. The cup is placed on the chest and all the air is removed, this pulls up the chest. 

The Ravitch technique is from the 1950s. It involves cutting out part of the chest, placing a bar in the chest, and having the bone grow back. Most doctors do not use the Ravitch because it causes much blood loss.

J Di's only activity for a long time was switching their status on the Admin and Bureaucrats page from "inactive" to "active" and I find it hard to define making just those edits as "active" - there was no discussion about the tools being taken away, just which column the user should be in. If anything, there are too many admins here (as an aside, not relevant to this) and there has been previous concern that an admin account that is not active is more likely to be hacked (I've never understood that argument myself, to be honest, but it has been made). Then there is the argument that an admin needs to be actively involved in the project in order to be fully aware of change in policy and guidelines. If a candidate went for RFA after nine months of inactivity, they would have no chance of succeeding. Being handed the mop and not using it seems as bad, to me, as those who fail RFA and then go on immediate Wikibreak! Though, to answer your specific questions, I think it is 1) concerns about the inactive account being hacked and 2) Admins need to continually show their worth. I may be wide of the mark, but I hope that helps () 17:04, 24 January 2008 (UTC)
I don't have a problem with him having the tools, just the changing from active to inactive when there is really no evidence he is active. Those of us who were around for his RfA will recall how bad he wanted it, and then seemingly the next day (an exaggeration but in the grand scheme of things fairly accurate) he's gone. If he would just leave it at inactive there wouldn't be a problem. - 17:39, 24 January 2008 (UTC)
Yes, I agree, but my point is that we could debate this ad infinitum and get nowhere. A thread on the user's talk went to some length, the thread here is going to some length. I'm minded just to alter the list of active/inactive and have done with it! 18:18, 24 January 2008 (UTC)

I think it's clear that he should remain on the inactive list unless he asks for his sysop rights to be removed on meta or he becomes active again. I don't think there's much else to discuss about J Di at this time. · 21:34, 24 January 2008 (UTC)

Looks like this has been handled already, so just for the record:

Hey there, all. I would like to suggest that we add a new ruling to the criteria for adminship that details a minimum number of support votes needed in order to have a successful RfA. Looking back through the archives, I was shocked when people were promoted to sysop after an RfA had only 5 support votes and that was it (namely, freshstart, aflm, billz) in the past. We need to have this guideline in place so that if a particular user only gets 3 support votes and that's it, that I would think that that isn't enough of the general user population voting to know if he or she will use the tools to his/her benefit. That is why I think we should add a minimum number of support votes for a successful RfA. Note that this new guideline would only be involved with RfA's that only have support votes.

As for RfB's, looking at Netoholic's 'crat vote in the archive, he was promoted to 'crat with only 4 support votes. I think that this is way too few. Although this isn't as necessary as the RfA suggestion, we should still have it in place for when we get bigger. I think that we need to have a minimum of 10-15 support votes in order to say that an RfB is successful. 

While these may seem a bit obscure, I hope you guys see the benefit that these will give to the Simple English Wikipedia in the future. 

Cheers! 17:07, 29 January 2008 (UTC)

During May 2007 we had a rash of vandalism to movie related articles. Mainly it was copy/pastes of en:wp articles (usually lists of movies by specific companies) and adding fake movies to the lists. The vandalism was done from the IPs 125.238.112.25, 125.238.114.103 and 125.238.113.149. Currently we are getting a new batch of copy/pastes, movie additions, and new fake articles from the same IP range: 125.238.112.138. Keep an eye on changes from the 125.238.11x.xxx range to movies as these are likely to be false information or copy/pastes. -- 16:45, 1 February 2008 (UTC)

Okay, I feel kinda dumb for not being able to figure this out, but I need another admin to help me find where to change the toolbox links for everyone.

There is an issue with this new feature. IP addresses that have been blocked for vandalism will be allowed to continue vandalizing their own talk pages with this new feature in place. This will make a lot of vandalism to IP addresses' talk pages happen. I would like to suggest that IP addresses "not" be allowed to edit their talk pages, while named editors can. 16:52, 8 February 2008 (UTC)

A (friendly) difference of interpretation between Oysterguitarist and I.

Oyster refused to delete a user talk page as it did not meet QD criteria.
I would have allowed this as a user talk page is a userpage under deletion [Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#User_pages policy 2.1.6]. The user is a recently returned user, no warnings at all, and dialogue was most 18 months old. 

How would other admins have treated the QD request? Obviously that sentence in the deletion policy which simply says should be clarified after this discussion. 

I am not against Hebrew things or anything, but do you guys have a username policy? Because en.wiki does and foreign language names like לערי ריינהארט are not allowed, right? You don't have to block him, but can you at least change the username?-- () 00:20, 11 February 2008 (UTC)

Hey there all. I just want to bring up a point for discussion here. I've noticed that there has been a lot of vandalism of the Wikipedia policy pages, and I think that there shouldn't be any vandalism in these pages. I would like to propose the semi-protection of all policy pages (or at least the important ones) because of vandalism. I feel that IP addresses shouldn't even be allowed to edit Wikipedia policy pages because of the amount of vandalism that has occurred on these pages. I would like to ask people if they would consider the permanent semi-protection of the most important policy pages so that people can't vandalize them anymore. Does anyone else here agree with me on this topic? 15:09, 12 February 2008 (UTC)

I just wanted to alert all administrators about this range of IP's that has been going through and vandalizing and , as well as other pages. I would like to ask that administrators keep their guard up for any IP address edits in the range of 151.49.x.x as they are most likely vandals. Thanks. 17:29, 15 February 2008 (UTC)

An administrator here has already range blocked this IP range for 24 hours for vandalism, however, once that 24 hours is up, I would like to ask any administrators that are on to keep a lookout for any more vandalizing edits from this range, as I am sure that there will be more vandalizing edits from this range after the block expires. 20:42, 15 February 2008 (UTC)

Central Park

Central Park is a large public park in the borough of Manhattan in New York City (U.S.). Central Park has about thirty-five million visitors every year. It is the most visited city park in the United States. The park contains lakes, a castle and the Central Park Zoo. The park has been shown in many movies and television programs.

It is 2.5 miles (4 km) long between 59th Street (Central Park South) and 110th Street (Central Park North), and is 0.5 miles (0.8 km) wide between Fifth Avenue and Central Park West. It is similar in size to San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, Chicago's Lincoln Park, Vancouver's Stanley Park, or Munich's Englischer Garten. It lies between the New York Theater District, Harlem (north), Upper West Side, and the Upper East Side.

Central Park is bordered on the north by West 110th Street, on the south by West 59th Street, on the west by Eighth Avenue, and on the east by Fifth Avenue. Along the park's borders however, these are known as Central Park North, Central Park South, and Central Park West, respectively. Only Fifth Avenue retains its name as the eastern border of the park.

It is bigger than Monaco and Vatican City.

The park initially opened in 1857, enlarged to cover of city-owned land. In 1858, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux won a design competition to improve and expand the park with a plan they entitled the Greensward Plan. Construction began the same year and was completed in 1873.

Designated a National Historic Landmark in 1963, the park is currently managed by the Central Park Conservancy under contract with the city government. The Conservancy is a nonprofit organization that contributes 85% of Central Park's $25 million dollar annual budget, and employs 80% of the park's maintenance staff.

Central Park has been mentioned in thousands of books, films, and TV shows. In the U.S. TV show ""Friends"" (1994-2004), the coffee shop, where the friends often gathered, was named "Central Perk" as a pun on the term "coffee percolator" (a type of pot used to brew coffee).

Ethylene

Ethylene or ethene is a chemical compound with two carbon atoms and four hydrogen atoms in each molecule. These molecules are put together with a double bond that makes it a hydrocarbon. It is very important in industry and has even been used in biology as a hormone. It is also the most made chemical. About 75 million tons of it have been made each year since 2005. 

Since 1795, ethylene was called an "olefiant gas", or "oil making gas". This was because it came together with chlorine to make the "oil of the Dutch chemists".

In 1866, the German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann came up with a system for naming hydrocarbons. The suffixes -ane, -ene, -ine, -one, and -une were used to call the hydrocarbons with 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 fewer hydrogen atoms than the alkane it came from. Because of this system, ethylene became ethene.

In 1979, the IUPAC decided that ethylene would stay ethylene.

Ethylene is made in the chemical industry by steam cracking. Some of the parts of an ethylene plant can be:


There are other systems in an ethylene plant. The systems listed above were the most important systems in an ethylene plant.

Since making ethylene uses a lot of energy, the people making the ethylene try very hard to keep the heat from the gasses from leaving the furnaces.

Skol is a brand of beer made by the Danish company Carlsberg Group. Skol was first brewed in 1959 for European customers. The beer's name comes from the Swedish word "skål" which means "to your health", a common toast (a word or phrase said before drinking). Skol is available in a few different flavors.

Skol was started in 1964 in Europe. It became available in Brazil in 1967. In 1979, it was one of the first beers to be sold in aluminum cans. As of 2004, Skol was available in more than 20 countries.

In 2000, the first annual Skol Beats music festival was held in São Paulo, Brazil. The type of music featured at Skol Beats is electronic, including trance, techno, electro, drum and bass, house, and breakbeat. Skol's new "Beats" beer was revealed at the 2000 festival. Beats has a different flavor and alcohol content than the original Skol. It is marketed as the beer for people that like parties and excitement.

In October of 2006, the new Skol Lemon was released. Response to Skol Lemon has been divided. Some people really like it and others do not.

<doc id="96275" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=96275" title="Archbishopric of Salzburg">
Archbishopric of Salzburg

The Archbishopric of Salzburg was a state of the Holy Roman Empire Archbishop of Salzburg as a Prince-Bishop. This means the archbishop had his ecclesiatical (church) powers and also the powers of an he Archbishopric was about the same size as the modern state of Salzburg in Austria.

The most famous Archbishop was probably the last to rule as a prince. He was Hieronymus von Colloredo, who was an early patron of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

In 450 a book was written about the live of St Severinus of Noricum. The book said that Salzburg had two churches and a monastery. St. Maxius is the only abbot-bishop known by name. Soon after Maxius was martyred, Salzburg was destroyed soon after in about 482.

St. Rupert later went back to Salzburg to set up the churches again. He saw the ruins of Salzburg overgrown with brambles, but no one knows whether he arrived about 543 during the time of Theodo I or in about 698 when Bavaria was conquered by the Franks.

It was not until after 700 that Christian civilisation started to grow again in the region. The cathedral monastery was named in honour of St. Peter and Rupert's niece Ehrentrudis founded the nunnery at Nonnberg.

Arno, Archbishop of Salzburg enjoyed the respect of the Frankish king Charlemagne. Charlemagne asked him to make the land between the Danube, the Raab, and Drave Rivers Christian. This area ad recently been taken from the Avars. Monasteries were founded and all of Carinthia was slowly Christianised.

While Arno was in Rome attending to some of Charlemagne's business in 798, Pope Leo III appointed him Archbishop over the other bishops in Bavaria (Freising, Passau, Regensburg, and Säben). When the dispute over the church's border between Salzburg and Aquileia broke out, Charlemagne declared the River Drave to be the border. Arno also began the copying of 150 volumes from the court of Charlemagne. This was the start of the first library in Austria.

The first archbishop of the era was Gebhard, who during the Investiture Controversy remained on the side of the Pope. Because of this, Gebhard was exiled for nine years, but was allowed to return shortly before his death and was buried in Admont. His successor Thimo was imprisoned for five years, and suffered a horrible death in 1102. After King Henry IV abdicated and Conrad I of Abensberg was elected Archbishop. Conrad lived in exile until the Calistine Concordat of 1122.

The Archbishops again took the side of the Pope during the arguments between the Pope and the Hohenstaufens. Archbishop Eberard I of Hilpolstein-Biburg was allowed to reign in peace, but his successor Conrad II of Austria made the Emperor's angry and died in 1168 in Admont trying to hide from the Emperor. Conrad III of Wittelsbach was appointed the Archbishop of Salzburg in 1177 at the Diet of Venice, after the supporters of both Pope and Emperor were deposed.

Archbishop Eberard II of Truchsess was made a prince of the Empire in 1213, and created three new sees: Chiemsee (1216), Seckau (1218) and Lavant (1225). Eberard was excommunicated in 1245 after refusing to publish a decree deposing the emperor. Eberard died suddenly the next year. During the German Interregnum, Salzburg also suffered confusion. Philip of Carinthia was made ruler of Salzburg, but refused to become a priest. This meant he could not be Archbishop, so he was deposed (sacked) by Ulrich, Bishop of Seckau.

King Rudolph I of Habsburg quarrelled with the archbishops. The arguments wer started by Abbot Henry of Admont After Henry died the archbishops and the Habsburgs made peace in 1297. The people and archbishops of Salzburgs remained loyal to the Habsburgs in their struggles against the Wittelsbachs. When the Black Death reached Salzburg in 1347, the Jews were accused of poisoning the wells and suffered severe persecution. The Jews were expelled from Salzburg in 1404. Later, the Jews were allowed to return but were forced to wear pointed hats. Although the Renaissance was a time when new paintings, sculptures and music was being made across Europe, this did not happen in Salzburg because the archbishops were not got rulers, and because of poor conditions in the empire during the reign of Frederick IV.

Conditions were at their worst during the reign of Bernard II of Rohr. The country was in depression, local authorities were raising their own taxes and the Turks were attackingthe archdiocese. In 1473, he summoned the first provincial diet (parliament) in the history of the archbishopric, and eventually abdicated. It was only Leonard of Keutschach (reigned 1495–1519) who changedthe situation. He had all the burgermeisters and town councillors (who were charging unfair taxes) arrested at the same time and imprisoned in the castle. His last years were spent in bitter struggle against Matthäus Lang of Wellenburg, Bishop of Gurk, who succeeded him in 1519.

Archbishop Paris of Lodron led Salzburg to peace and prosperity during the Thirty Years' War in which the rest of Germany was thoroughly devastated. During the reign of Leopold Anthony of Firmian, Protestants emerged more vigorously than before. He invited the Jesuits to Salzburg and asked for help from the emperor, and finally ordered the Protestants to recant or emigrate - about 30,000 people left and settled in Württemberg, Hanover and East Prussia, and a few settled in Georgia in the United States of America. The last Prince-Archbishop, Hieronymus of Colloredo, is probably the most well-known for his patronage of Mozart. His reforms of the church and education alienated himself from the people.

In 1803, Salzburg was secularised (stopped being control by the church) as the Electorate of Salzburg. The former Grand Duke Ferdinand III of Tuscany (brother of Emperor Francis II) was made elector. In 1805 Salzburg became a part of Austria, and in 1809, a part of Bavaria. The Bavarians closed the University of Salzburg, banned monasteries from accepting novices (new monks for training), and banned pilgrimages and processions. The Congress of Vienna returned Salzburg to the Austrians in 1814.


"Abandoned after c. 482"




The secularized Duchy of Salzburg was created in 1803, but annexed by Austria in 1805. The Duke of Salzburg was transferred to the Grand Duchy of Würzburg:

A Stone circle is an ancient monument. It is made of several standing stones, usually Menhirs that are arranged in a certain way. Very often those stones form circles or ellipses. The number of stones can vary between four and 60. Very often, burial sites are located in the circle, or nearby.

There are approximately 1,000 stone circles and 80 stone henges in the British Isles (Great Britain and Ireland.

Most likely stone circles were used for rituals. They might also have been used at calendars; some stone circles are arranged so that certain sotnes are lit on special dates, like the summer solstice.

Standing stone

Standing stones are stones that are set into the ground vertically. They were a feature of Neolithic people in the British Isles and Brittany, but occur elsewhere in the world. 

There may be single standing stones, circles, lines or groups of them. Their dates are mostly from 4000 BC to 1,500 BC. Since Neolithic peoples did not have writing, we know little about their use. It is generally thought they had both practical (meeting place) and ceremonial or religious uses.

Pottery that has been found near some of these stones suggest some of them in Europe belonged to the so-called 'Beaker culture'.

Elisée Reclus

Élisée Reclus (March 15 1830–July 4 1905), also known as Jean Jacques Élisée Reclus, was a French geographer and anarchist.

He was born at Sainte-Foy-la-Grande (Gironde). He was the second son of a Protestant priest, who had a family of fourteen children.His education, begun in Rhenish Prussia, was continued in the Protestant college of Montauban, and completed at the university of Berlin, where he followed a long course of geography under Karl Ritter.

After 1851, he spent the next six years (1852–1857) visiting the British Isles, the United States, Central America, and Colombia. On his return to Paris he contributed to the "Revue des deux mondes", the "Tour du monde" and other papers, with a large number of articles about geography.

In 1867–1868 he published "La Terre; description des phénomènes de la vie du globe", in two volumes.During the 1870 siege of Paris, he was in the National Guard, while as a member of the Association Nationale des Travailleurs he published in the "Cri du Peuple" an article against the government of Versailles in support of the Paris Commune of 1871.Continuing to serve in the National Guard, now in open revolt, he was taken prisoner on April 5, and on November 16 sentenced to transportation for life; but, after changed in an ban as an exile.

Reclus also visited Italy, and Switzerland, where he wrote many articles about geography.

In 1882 Reclus initiated the Anti-Marriage Movement. After this was followed by government prosecutions, instituted in the High Court of Lyon, against the anarchists, members of the International Association, of which Reclus and the other anarchist Kropotkin were designated as the two "leaders" of organization. Piotr Kropotkin was arrested and condemned to five years’ imprisonment, but Reclus, being resident in Switzerland, escaped.

After 1892 he taught in university of Brussels, and contributed in many journals about science and geography.

Some articles wrote by Reclus:

Reclus died at Torhout, near Bruges.

Michael Emerson

Michael Emerson (born September 7, 1954) is an American theatre, television, and movie actor. He won an "Outstanding Guest Actor" Emmy in 2001 for a part on "The Practice", but is currently most famous for playing Zep Hindle in the 2004 film "Saw" and Ben Linus in the television series "Lost".

Emerson was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and grew up in the nearby town of Toledo, Iowa. He studied theater and art at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, and graduated in 1976. He then moved to New York City. He had trouble finding work as an actor so he took retail jobs and worked as a freelance illustrator. In 1986, he moved with his first wife to Jacksonville, Florida. In Jacksonville, between 1986 to 1993, he was in local productions, and worked as a teacher and director.

Emerson thought about not being an actor and being a teacher instead, because it is a more stable job. He decided to go back to school and get a Master of Fine Arts. He thought it might help him meet theatre professionals and directors. 

Emerson's first big role was in 1997. He starred as Oscar Wilde in Moises Kaufman's play, "Gross Indecency: The Trials of Oscar Wilde," and then was in many other plays. In 1998, he acted with Uma Thurman in the off-Broadway production of "The Misanthrope". In 1999, he played the part of Willie Oban in "The Iceman Cometh" with Kevin Spacey. He co-starred with Kate Burton in both "Give Me Your Answer, Do!" and "Hedda Gabler".

In movies and television, Emerson played somewhat dangerous, damaged characters. He played the roles so that the character would seem mysterious. In 2001, he won an Emmy Award as "Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series", for playing the (fictional) confessed serial killer William Hinks in several episodes of "The Practice".

One of Emerson's most well-known works was in 2004, as the character Zep Hindle in the horror movie "Saw". In 2006, Emerson began guest-starring on the television series "Lost" as Henry Gale/Ben Linus . He was originally planned to be in a small number of episodes, but he returned for season 3 as a main cast member. In 2007, he was nominated for another Emmy Award for his work on the series.

Jörg Haider

Jörg Haider (26 January 1950 – 11 October, 2008) was an Austrian politician that was often called to be off right-populism ("rechtspopulist"). He was born in Bad Goisern, Upper Austria, and died near Klagenfurt, Austria.

At the age of 29 he became the youngest member of the Austrian parliament and in 1989 the Governor of Carinthia for the first time.

Haider lead the Freedom Party to great success so that in 1999 the party reached the second most votes with 27% behind the SPÖ with 33% and could form a coalition with the Austrian People's Party ÖVP (having for the first time only the third most votes) making Wolfgang Schüssel Chancellor of Austria.

Haider passed his leading position to other party members so that a coalition could take place and returned to Carinthia to work as Governor again.

In 2004 Haider was re-elected as Governor of Carinthia. One year later the leading members of the FPÖ as well as there party members in the government together with Jörg Haider (as their new head) founded a new Party, the BZÖ. In 2006 the BZÖ party reached the 4% (that time lead under P. Westenthaler) in the Austrian elections and so became part of the Parliament with 7 representatives. For the snap elections in September 2008 he was voted unanimity in his party for the leading position and ran as candidate again for the elections like back in the nineties. Surprisingly the party gained 10.7% and therefore could rise its seats 3 times now having 21 representatives under the lead of Jörg Haider. However Haider promised before the votes toke place too remain Governor as he would have only changed as of becoming Chancellor. There were possibilities to build a government with Jörg Haider as chancellor (Haider already achieved to form a coalition where the ÖVP under Schüssel with the 3rd most votes got the Chancellor) or at least the BZÖ represented in the government. For this a coalition of BZÖ with FPÖ and ÖVP was necessary, however Haider never got into this position.

On 11 October 2008, Haider died in a traffic accident near the town of Klagenfurt. He was returning home after an event that had taken place earlier. Many people living in Carinthia in reaction to his death, left public offerings as flowers, candles, cards and personal messages, Austrian singer and intendant Harald Serafin called the tragic death even an "Austro-Lady-Diana-Story".

Perspective (graphical)

Perspective (from Latin "perspicere", to see through) in the graphic arts, such as drawing, is a way to represent 3-dimensional objects on a flat surface (such as paper). The two most characteristic features of perspective are:

Perspective works by representing the light that passes from a scene through an imaginary rectangle (the painting), to the viewer's eye. It is similar to a viewer looking through a window and painting what is seen directly onto the windowpane. If viewed from the same spot as the windowpane was painted, the painted image would be identical to what was seen through the unpainted window. Each painted object in the scene is a flat, scaled down version of the object on the other side of the window.

Eichsfeld is a rural district in Thuringia, Germany, and is part of the historical region of Eichsfeld. 

In medieval times the district of Eichsfeld was much largaer than the persent rural district and was owned by the Archbishops of Mainz.

Eichsfeld was the only part of Thuringia not to accept the Protestant Reformation, mostly because of the efforts of the Archbishop of Mainz.

In 1801 the clerical states were dissolved, and Prussia took over. 

The present district was established in 1994 by merging the former districts of Worbis and Heiligenstadt.

Into the Wild (Warriors)

Into the Wild is the first book in the "Warriors" series. It was written by Kate Cary and Cherith Baldry under the pen name of Erin Hunter. This book was written by Kate Cary.

Rusty was an ordinary house cat who dreamed of living in the wild, catching his own prey and sleeping under the stars. One night, he decided to explore the nearby forest but was warned by his friend, Smudge, that the forest was filled with dangerous, wild cats. Rusty continued into the forest anyway and meets with the leader of ThunderClan, Bluestar leader of one of the four wild cat clans living in the nearby forest. He decides to accept her invitation to join her clan and becomes Firepaw, an apprentice of ThunderClan. The other Clan cats are initially reluctant to accept Firepaw because of his kittypet origins, but he earns a place in the Clan as he is a natural fighter, hunter,and a truly loyal member of ThunderClan.

Firepaw quickly becomes best friends with the apprentices Graypaw and Ravenpaw, and falls in love with the Clan's medicine cat (a Clan healer with spiritual abilities, forbidden to have a mate or kits) Spottedleaf. He continues his apprenticeship and learns to hunt, fight, survive in the wild and about Clan traditions. He finds another great friend, Yellowfang, an old, grumpy but very profound medicine cat who was exiled from ShadowClan and later accepted into ThunderClan and taken care of by Firepaw.

The cats have no natural enemies in the forest, but the Clans occasionally fight with each other to occupy hunting grounds, to settle dissensions, or even to drive each other out from their territories. In an earlier battle to re-occupy a region known as sunning rocks, the ThunderClan deputy (second in command) Redtail loses his life. This happens shortly before Firepaw arrives. Firepaw later learns from Ravenpaw that the deputy was not killed by the enemy Clan but by Tigerclaw, an ambitious ThunderClan warrior. Expecting to be named deputy, he is disturbed when Lionheart is made the new deputy just after Firepaw arrives. Firepaw and Graypaw help Ravenpaw escape the forest to live on a farm as Tigerclaw plans to kill him for knowing about his secret...

After driving out WindClan for more hunting territory, ShadowClan tries to drive out ThunderClan, leading to a battle. Lionheart is killed during the fight, and Tigerclaw is named deputy. After this, Clawface of ShadowClan kills Spottedleaf and steals some ThunderClan kits. Everyone leads to suspect that it was Yellowfang who took the kits, considering she disappeared the moment they revealed Clawface's murder. Firepaw, along with Graypaw, follow Yellowfang's scent to ShadowClan territory, to find out the truth about Spottedleaf and the missing kits. Together, with some help from within ShadowClan, they drive out Brokenstar, the villainous leader of ShadowClan. Yellowfang, having proved her loyalty, becomes ThunderClan's new medicine cat, while Firepaw and Graypaw are made warriors and receive their warrior names, Fireheart and Graystripe.

Critical density

Critical density is the value at which the Universe is at balance, and expansion is stopped. This value is estimated as (1-3) * 10^-26 kg/m^3. 

This is related to the cosmic density parameter in many ways; this term describes the ratio of the actual density value of the Universe to the critical density value. If the ratio is one, then the Universe is at balance, and the Universe is flat. If the ratio is greater than one, then the actual density of the Universe is greater than the critical density, and thus the Universe will eventually become closed. If the ratio is less than one, then the actual density is less than the critical density, and the Universe is open.

Non-Euclidean geometry

Non-Euclidean geometry is a type of geometry. Non-Euclidean geometry only uses some of the "postulates" (assumptions) that Euclidean geometry is based on. In normal geometry, parallel lines can never meet. In non-Euclidean geometry they can meet, either once (elliptic geometry), or infinity many (hyperbolic geometry) times.

An example of Non-Euclidian geometry can be seen by drawing lines on a ball or other round object, straight lines that are parallel at the equator can meet at the poles

It is called "Non-Euclidean" because it is different from Euclidean geometry, which was discovered by an Ancient Greek man named Euclid. The different names for non-Euclidean geometries come from thinking of "straight" lines as curved lines, either curved inwards like an ellipse, or outwards like a hyperbola.

Julia Fischer

Julia Fischer (born 15 June 1983) is a German violinist. By training she is also a professional pianist, but she rarely plays the piano in public.

Julia Fischer, born in Munich, Germany, is of German-Slovakian parentage. Her mother came from the German minority in Slovakia and emigrated from Košice in Slovakia to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1972. Her German father moved in the same year from Eastern Saxony to West Germany.

In fall 2004 the label PentaTone released Julia Fischer's first CD: Russian violin concertos with Yakov Kreizberg and the Russian National Orchestra.

Julia Fischer began her studies before her fourth birthday, when she received her first violin lesson from Helge Thelen; a few months later she started studying the piano with her mother Viera Fischer. Fischer said, "my mother's a pianist and I wanted to play the piano as well, but as my elder brother also played the piano, she thought it would be nice to have another instrument in the family. I agreed to try out the violin and stayed with it." She began her formal violin education at the Leopold Mozart Conservatory in Augsburg. At the age of nine Julia Fischer went to the Munich Academy of Music. 

Among the most prestigious competitions that Julia Fischer has won are the International Yehudi Menuhin Violin Competition under Lord Yehudi Menuhin's supervision, where she won both the first prize and the special prize for best Bach solo work performance in 1995 and the Eighth Eurovision Competition for Young Instrumentalists in 1996, which was broadcast in 22 countries from Lisbon. In 1997 Julia Fischer was awarded the “Prix d‘Espoir” by the Foundation of European Industry. She recently had the opportunity to play Mozart's own violin in the room in which he was born at Salzburg to honour his 250th birthday.

Her repertoire (from Bach to Penderecki, from Vivaldi to Shostakovich), contains over 40 works with orchestra and about 60 works of chamber music.

At the moment she plays on a Guadagnini made in 1750 which she bought in summer 2004.
For four years since 2000, she had been using a Stradivarius, the 1716 Booth, on loan from Nippon Music Foundation. Before he had the Strad, she played a Guarneri del Gesù and a Gagliano. She uses two bows, one a copy of the Heifetz Tourte by the Viennese maker Thomas Gerbeth, the other a French bow which she uses when she needs to send the Tourte bow away to be rehaired.

Julia Fischer has won five prizes for her violin playing and three prizes for her piano playing a.o. at "Jugend musiziert". She won all eight competitions she entered.


After releasing ten CDs for PentaTone her eleventh CD was released by Decca.

Interstate H-1 (or H-1) is the most important interstate highway in Hawaii, United States, located on the island of O‘ahu. The road sees more traffic than any other interstate in Hawaii. Despite the number, this is an east-west highway—the 'H'-series (for Hawaii) numbering is done in the order in which routes were given money and built. H-1 goes from Route 93 (Farrington Highway) in Kapolei to Route 72 (Kalanianaole Highway) in Kāhala. East of Middle Street in Honolulu (exit 19A), H-1 is called the Lunalilo Freeway and is sometimes signed as such at older signs in the center of Honolulu.

Despite the number, this is a north–south interstate—the 'H'-series (for Hawaii) numbering reflects the order in which routes were given money and built. Its southern terminus is at Interstate H-1 in Pearl City, and its northern terminus is at Wilikina Drive (Route 99) in Wahiawā near Schofield Barracks and Wheeler Army Airfield. The route is long.

Fairtrade

Fairtrade certification (often just Fairtrade or Fair Trade Certified™ in the United States and England) is a system which gives a certificate to some products. These products must follow rules about fairness to workers and the environment.

The FLO International system gives certificates to many different products, including bananas, honey, oranges, cocoa, cotton, dried and fresh fruits and vegetables, juices, nuts and oil seeds, quinoa, rice, spices, sugar, tea and wine.

Fairtrade is an alternative approach to conventional trade and is based on a partnership between producers and consumers. Fairtrade offers producers a better deal and improved terms of trade. This allows them the opportunity to improve their lives and plan for their future. Fairtrade offers consumers a powerful way to reduce poverty through their every day shopping. 

When a product carries the FAIRTRADE Mark it means the producers and traders have met Fairtrade standards. The standards are designed to address the imbalance of power in trading relationships, unstable markets and the injustices of conventional trade.

728 Leonisis is an asteroid of the Flora family, found by Johann Palisa in 1912 in Vienna. Its provisional name was 1912 NU.

Astronomers are not sure what its spectral class is. It has been previously placed in the rare A and L classes . These are generally "stony" spectra, but with significant differences from the usual S-type. The unusual spectrum brings Leonisis' membership in the Flora family into doubt.

Greiz Rural District

Greiz is a Landkreis (rural district) in the east of Thuringia, Germany.

Historically the area of the district was part of the "Vogtland", named after the title "Vogt" given to the local rulers in the 13th century. Only two lines of the "Reuß" family survived from that time, with one principality based in Greiz, and the other in Gera and Schleiz. In 1919 both were merged into the "Volksstaat Reuß" (People's State of Reuss), which then became part of Thuringia in 1920.

A subcamp of the Buchenwald concentration camp was located at Berga/Elster during World War II. The SS made inmates dig tunnels and lay railway tracks for the Schwalbe V project.

The district in its current form was created on July 1, 1994, when the districts Gera-Land, Zeulenroda and the previous district Greiz were merged.

Ilm-Kreis Rural District

Ilm-Kreis is a district in Thuringia, Germany.

In medieval times the territory was ruled by the counts of Henneberg and the princes of Schwarzburg, two local dynasties. While Ilmenau was ruled by Henneberg, Arnstadt belonged to Schwarzburg. When the Henneberg family became extinct in 1583, Ilmenau was acquired by Saxony. The principality of Schwarzburg was split up between family members into several tiny states. One of those states (Schwarzburg-Arnstadt) was based in Arnstadt; it was founded in 1574 and existed until 1716, when it became part of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen. It became part of Thuringia when the Freestate of Thuringia was founded in 1920.

The district was founded in 1920 (under the name Arnstadt); it was divided in 1952 into the districts of Arnstadt and Ilmenau, but joined together again in 1994.

Wizard's First Rule

Wizard's First Rule is a book written by Terry Goodkind. It is the first book in the epic fantasy series called "The Sword of Truth". It was published by Tor Books on August 15, 1994 as a hardcover book, meaning the book was made with a hard cover. The paperback book was released on July 15, 1997. A special version of the book was released on June 23, 2001. It featured art on the cover by Keith Parkinson. This special version was also a paperback version of the book.


The main character in "Wizard’s First Rule" is Richard Cypher. Richard is a woods guide who lives in the area of the world called Westland. Westland is the only part of the world that contains no magic. Westland is set apart from the other lands of the world by a very evil magic boundary. The boundary stops anyone from coming through into the Westland from the Midlands. As a woods guide, Richard leads important political people through the woods to wherever they need to go in Westland. Richard has a brother called Michael Cypher. He is the First Coucilor of Westland. 

Richard's father, George Cypher, was mysteriously killed in the beginning of the book. Because of this, Richard entered a state of sadness. When Richard finds out about an interesting vine left in a jar for him by his dead father, Richard decides to go into the forest to try to find the vine. This leads him to help a traveller escape from 4 men that are chasing her through the forest. The traveller is called Kahlan Amnell, and the people she is running from are called a quad. 

Richard saves Kahlan from the quad. After saving Kahlan, Richard learns that he had just helped someone who had come through the boundary. Before then, it was not heard of for someone to come through the boundary. Richard finds out that Kahlan is looking for the First Wizard. Richard feels that she is in need of help. Because of this, Richard takes Kahlan to his best friend, Zedd.

When he goes to visit his friend, Richard learns that his friend, Zedd, has kept many secrets from him. Richard finds out that Zedd is really the wizard that Kahlan has been looking for. 

Kahlan tells Zedd about some of the events that are taking place in the Midlands. Darken Rahl, who is the in the book, is leading an army against the Midlands. After hearing of these events, Zedd decides that Richard is the true Seeker. In doing so, Zedd gives Richard the Sword of Truth. Zedd then decided that they need to cross the boundary to stop Darken Rahl from the world using the magic of the boxes of Orden. 

Richard finds out that the boxes of Orden hold the power of life and death. He also finds out that Darken Rahl needs 3 boxes and needs to open them in the correct order using the information written in the Book of Counted Shadows. Richard was taught the Book of Counted Shadows as a little boy by his father. 

Richard then finds a way through the boundary thanks to his friend, Chase. Chase is a boundary . Boundary wardens are officials who keep people from getting too close to the boundary. Chase tells Richard that there is a pass through the boundary. Chase leads them to the pass.

Along the way to the pass, Richard and his friends are attacked by underworld creatures. This encounter leaves both Zedd and Chase in a state of sleep. Soon after this event takes place, Richard and Kahlan reach the home of Adie. Adie is a bone sorcereress, and is the only one who can tell Richard and Kahlan how to get through the boundary. They leave Zedd and Chase in Adie's care, and cross through the boundary. 

After they cross into the Midlands, Richard finds out that the Mud People are the only people who knows where the box of Orden is that they need to stop Darken Rahl from taking over the world. After teaching the Mud People how to make roofs that do not leak, they give Ricahrd the information he needs. 

The book then follows Zedd, Kahlan, Richard, and Chase, as they try to keep the box of Orden from Darken Rahl, who is trying to take over the world.

People will believe a lie either because they want to believe it's true or because they are afraid it might be true.
This rule was a big part of the story and it was also the way that Richard ends up killing Darken Rahl at the end of the book.

Dietary fiber

Dietary fiber is the part of food from plants that cannot be digested. Dietary fiber helps to absorb water or remove waste from the body. Dietary fiber has many parts that plants have, and is eaten in plant foods.

Dietary fiber includes substances like cellulose, wax and lignin, among others. The term "fiber" is not the best way to describe it, because many of these substances are not actually fibers.

Dietary Fiber is grouped if it is soluble or insoluble. Soluble means if it helps to absorb water or not. If it is insoluble, it helps remove wastes from the body.

Super Smash Bros. (series)

Super Smash Bros., also known as SSB or Smash Bros., is a series of fighting video games made by Nintendo. There are three games in the series. Most of the characters are from other Nintendo games, but in "Super Smash Bros. Brawl", there are two characters that are not from Nintendo. 

"SSB" started in 1999, when "Super Smash Bros." was released for the Nintendo 64. In 2001, "Super Smash Bros. Melee" was made for the Nintendo GameCube. The third game, "Super Smash Bros. Brawl", came out in stores in 2008 for the Nintendo Wii. "Brawl" came out on July 26, 2008 in Australia and it came out in Europe the day after. It came out in North America on March 9, 2008.

Much of the game involves custom fighting between different characters in Nintendo games, with the object of making fall off the map. Players can pick which characters they want. At the beginning, there are default characters, who are usually the stars of their video games. One can get the secret characters by doing some things in one-player mode, such as killing 100 monsters in a row. The secret characters are usually bad guys or sidekicks (characters who help the main characters). Here is a list of characters who have been in at least one Super Smash Brothers:



The characters have different abilities and attacks, but are used by pushing the same buttons--A is for normal attacks (hitting), and B is for special attacks (such as hitting harder or shooting things).

One of the trademarks of Super Smash Bros. is that items appear or fall out of the sky. Players can use these items to kill opponents. These items include bombs, peaches, baseball bats, assist trophies (which produce another character to help kill opponents), and Smash balls (which give the character superpowers)

In choosing how to play the game, one can choose the stage where it is played. Many of them are based on places in Nintendo games, such as Mario, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and EarthBound; but others (such as the Final Destination) are new to SSB.

<doc id="96661" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=96661" title="John Heartfield">
John Heartfield

John Heartfield (June 19, 1891–April 26, 1968) is the English version of the name of the German photomontage artist Helmut Herzfeld. He started to call himself "Heartfield" in 1916, to criticize the rabid nationalism and anti-British sentiment in Germany during World War I.

In 1918, Heartfield began at the Berlin Dada scene, and the Communist Party of Germany. He was thrown out of the Reichswehr film service because he supported the strike after the assassination of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. With George Grosz, he founded "Die Pleite", a satirical magazine. Heartfield started to work for two communist publications: the daily Die Rote Fahne ("The Red Flag")and the weekly Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung (AIZ)("Workers' Illustrated Newspaper"). AIZ published Heartfield's most famous work

In 1933, after the National Socialists came to power in Germany, Heartfield moved to Czechoslovakia, where he continued his photomontage work for the "AIZ" (which was published in exile); in 1938, the Nazis were preparing to invade Czechoslovakia, so he moved to England, and lived in Hampstead, London. After World War II he settled in East Germany, after 1954 he lived in East Berlin and worked closely with theatre directors such as Benno Besson and Wolfgang Langhoff at Berliner Ensemble and Deutsches Theater.

In 2005, Tate Britain held an exhibition of his photomontage pieces.

His photomontages satirising Adolf Hitler and the Nazis often used Nazi symbols such as the swastika to change their propaganda message. 

One of his more famous pieces, made in 1935 entitled "Hurrah, die Butter ist Alle!" () was published on the frontpage of the "AIZ" in 1935. The photomontage shows a family at a kitchen table, where a nearby portrait of Hitler hangs and the wallpaper is covered with swastikas. The family — mother, father, old woman, young man, baby, and dog — are trying to eat pieces of metal, such as chains, bicycle handlebars, and rifles. Below, the title is written in large letters, in addition to a quote by Hermann Goering during food shortage. Translated, the quote reads: ""Iron has always made a nation strong, butter and lard have only made the people fat"". The picture makes fun of a speech Goering made, the quote is shortened to "Guns before butter"

"Hurrah, die Butter ist Alle!" served as the inspiration behind the song "Metal Postcard (Mittageisen)" by Siouxsie & the Banshees; the song was re-recorded in German and released as a single with Heartfield's work as the cover art.

The Heartfield piece "The Hand has 5 Fingers" with its original text: ""5 fingers make a hand! With these 5 grab the enemy!"", was referenced by alternative metal band System of a Down. A text printed on the back of the album "System of a Down" reads: ""The hand has five fingers, capable and powerful, with the ability to destroy as well as create"".

Electronvolt

The electronvolt or electron volt, symbol eV, is used to measure energy. It is defined as the amount of energy a single electron has after being accelerated by 1 volt of electricity. Joules are used most often to measure energy, but it is sometimes useful to use electronvolts for very small amounts of energy. To convert joules into electronvolts, divide joules by the charge of an electron, which is about 1.602, 

E.g. 5 J = 5/1.602 5 J = 3.125 eV.
Conversion Tool
The electronvolt is often used in atomic, nuclear and particle physics.

Appanage

Appanage is important to the history of France during the Middle Ages. The law said that when a king dies, his oldest son becomes the next king. Kings who wanted to give a younger son some land too sometimes created an appanage. Appanage was one way to keep a civil war from happening, if two or more sons wanted to fight each other to be the next king.

The younger son controlled the appanage as a duke and ruled almost like a king, except he could not sell the land. The ruler of an appanage could give it to his sons and grandsons, but eventually that part of the family would run out of sons and the land would go back to the king.

Barahona Province

Barahona is a Dominican province; it is located in the southwestern part of the country. Its capital city is Santa Cruz de Barahona.

It was created as a "Maritime District", an old category given to some regions along the coast, on 12 September 1881. The Dominican Constitution of 1907 changed the Maritime Districts to province.

Barahona is bordered to the northwest by the province of Baoruco, to the northeast by Azua, to the west by the Independencia province. The Pedernales province is to the southwest and south of Barahona and the Caribbean Sea is to the east.

The province takes the name from its capital city, Santa Cruz de Barahona. Barahona is a Spanish last name, and it seems that a Spanish colonist with that name lived in the area.

The province was part of the old Azua. It was created as a Maritime District on 12 September 1881 with the municipalities of Santa Cruz de Barahona, Cabral, Duvergé, Enriquillo and Neiba. Its category was changed to province by the Dominican Constitution of 1907.

Two new provinces were created from the original province of Barahona. The Baoruco Province was created in 1943 and then the Pedernales Province in 1957.

Barahona has a total area of 1,739.38 km². It has 3.6% of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 12th (out of 31 plus the National District) largest province.

There are two important regions in the province: the valley of the River Yaque del Sur, in the north of the province, and the "Sierra de Bahoruco" ("Bahoruco mountain range"). Because the Sierra de Bahoruco gets to the coast, most of the population lives on the coast or near the river Yaque del Sur; the only town in the mountains is Polo.

The eastern part of Sierra de Neiba is in the northwest of the province and the Sierra Martín García is the limit with the Azua Province, in the northeast.

The valley of the river Yaque del Sur is an important farming centre in the southwest because people here uses the water of the river to grow different crops, mainly plantain and sugar cane. The Rincón lake is in this valley; fishing is an important activity in this lake.
The Sierra de Bahoruco is in the rest of the province (south, center and west); the part of the Sierra de Bahoruco that is in the province of Barahona is called "Bahoruco Oriental" (Eastern Bahoruco) because it is different from the rest of the mountain range. While pines are common in the Sierra de Bahoruco, they are not common in Eastern Bahoruco where there are rainforests because those mountains, and the province, have the Caribbean Sea to the east and winds bring a lot of water that falls on the mountains.

The highest mountain in Eastern Bahoruco is Pie de Palo (1,603 m). Other high mountains are Trocha de Pey (1,476 m), La Torre (1,455 m) and Loma Remigio (1,287 m).

The most important river of the province is Yaque del Sur. Other rivers are Nizaíto (23 km long) and Bahoruco (14 km). The river San Rafael is only 3 km long but many persons go there during summer to enjoy its cool waters and part of its water is taken to the city of Barahona.

The climate of the province is a tropical climate, very hot and dry in the valley, but it is cooler on the mountains. In the valley, cacti and other plants of dry regions are common. Rainforests are common in the mountains of the province because it rains a lot in the Bahoruco Oriental.

There are three important roads in the province, and they get to the border with Haiti. One of them goes through the province from north to south and gets to Pedernales after crossing the Sierra de Bahoruco by the coast.

The other two roads get to Jimaní; they go around the Lake Enriquillo, one by the northern side and the other by the southern side of the lake.

There are 11 municipalities and 11 municipal districts in the province.

The municipalities are:

In 2002 (last national census), there were 179,239 people living in the Barahona province, and 134,714 (75.16%) living in towns and cities. The population density was 103 persons/km².

The estimated population in the province for 2007 was of 201,453 inhabitants: 103,394 men and 98,059 women, for a population density of 115.82 persons/km².

The main economic activity of the province is agriculture; the main products are coffee in the mountains and plantain and sugar cane in the valley of the river Yaque del Sur.

Other important economic activities are industry (sugar and textiles) in Santa Cruz de Barahona and fishing along the Caribbean coast.

Black bread mold

The Black bread mold, Rhizopus, is a common type of fungus. 

It grows and reproduces the same way that most moulds do. In asexual reproduction, the mould makes spores inside a "sporangium". When the spores are ready to leave and spread more mold, the sporangium breaks open and lets the spores float out. In sexual reproduction its hyphae touch the hyphae of another "Rhizopus" mycelium. When they fuse, they make round balls called "zygospores". After some time, the zygospore makes another sporangium, which then makes spores. During this sexual process, genetic recombination takes place, as with all eukaryotes.

The spores land on a place where they can turn into a new mould, and begin to grow. They very quickly start making "hyphae", small tendrils that look like roots. Hyphae are not roots, but part of the mycelium. The mycelium is the main part of the mould, and grows inside the bread. Black bread mould grows fast when the temperature is higher than 15 degrees Celsius and lower than 20C.

Black bread mould is found in all countries of the world. It is often found growing on bread and on soft fruits such as bananas and grapes. Because the mould spores are airborne, the mould can spread easily.

Dental surgeons will perform surgery to fix large or dangerous problems with people's teeth. There are also dentists called orthodontists, who can move peoples teeth using braces. Dental surgeons and orthodontists are called specialists.

Rhythmic gymnastics

Rhythmic gymnastics (short:RG) is a sport in which individuals or teams of competitors (generally five) manipulate one or two apparatus: rope, hoop, ball, clubs, and ribbon. Rhythmic gymnastics is a sport that combines elements of ballet, gymnastics, dance, and apparatus manipulation. The victor is the participant who earns the most points, determined by a panel of judges, for leaps, balances, pirouettes, flexibilities, apparatus handling, execution, and artistic effect.

International competitions are split between Juniors, under sixteen by their year of birth; and Seniors, for women sixteen and over again by their year of birth. Gymnasts typically start training at a very young age and those at their peak are typically in their late teens or early twenties. The largest events in the sport are the Olympic Games, World Championships, and Grand-Prix Tournaments.

Wealth often means that much money is available. But there are several other aspects that can be more important. If one thinks of single persons one will look at their personal property like land and livestock. Looking at countries one thinks of GDP per capita and of natural capital.

The original meaning of the old English word for "weal", where wealth comes from, was "well-being" or welfare. (It was an adjective.)

As you can see on , our last plans for the Main Page selected article extended up to Feb 23 (five days from now). In the mean time, many things have happened to our VGA and GA process and criteria, and I'm personally not hopeful that we can gather enough VGAs in near future to update the Main Page selected articles list fully. So I propose:
What do you think? - 20:34, 17 February 2008 (UTC)

Is there a rule on Simple English Wikipedia that only articles that exist on English Wikipedia may be tolerated here? - () 19:28, 18 February 2008 (UTC)

Except for the notable ones, all of the new Pokemon articles need to be combined into lists of 20 IMHO. What does everyone else think? -- 20:45, 18 February 2008 (UTC)

Hello all,

it looks like we are finally getting somewhere. As outlined above, about a third of the VGAs were demoted (to GAs, mostly).
This of course also means that we can re-start the VGA process. Note: It is probably less work to get a GA to meet VGA criteria than it is to get a regular article there; despite this, both ways are left open.

Keep up the good work -- () 16:07, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

Following a post from tygrrr on talk:coffee, I think it important to stress that the VGA/GA processes should encourage a search to find variants to fill redlinks (City of New York -> New York City for example) but there can never be a reason to fill in a redlink with a close matches as happened at coffee, ie changing solvation to solution.

I was surprised how many of the most wanted articles I was able to fill just by searching for variants -- 15:40, 20 February 2008 (UTC)

Yesterday and today, between (contribs) and (contribs), about 900 (basically) empty pages were created. Here are some examples of the creations: 150, 720, 1120. From what I can tell, they're "all" like that. I disagree quite strongly with having close to a "thousand" pages with "no content". My question to the community is this: what do we do with these pages? Deletion would be a lot of work but is perhaps the best option. A community push to fill them would also be a lot of work, but is also an option. We could leave them as is, under the assumption that "they'll be created eventually". I would be strongly against this, but it "is" an option. What do others think? (P.S. for the record, I think this should have been discussed "before" it happened. There should have been some foresight that this might have caused some concern to others.) · 16:46, 20 February 2008 (UTC)



If anyone would like me to start filling in pages, let me know. 16:49, 20 February 2008 (UTC)

So...should we start deleting ASAP? We should probably make it a multi-admin job to get it done as quickly as possible. · 14:18, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

 Durova's empty creations have all been deleted. · 16:49, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

I have a couple to recreate :P -- 19:55, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

I know that I'm a little bit too late to mention this now, but I just barely noticed that . While I'm assuming that some of you have already knew before, I just wanted to let everyone know in case they haven't yet. Three cheers to every simple wikipedian! :) -- 06:13, 23 February 2008 (UTC)

Hello all,
I have changed . It is only under now. This may be a problem; there are gnostic movements totally outside christianity (Persian schools, Kabbalah in Judaism); At the moment we have the main article Gnosticism in there (yes, needs extending), as well as a subcat Gnostic gods and godesses, with one entry. I moved the Catharism in there; it had Gnostic tendencies. This possibly means we need to re-cat once there is more.-- () 13:21, 23 February 2008 (UTC)

<doc id="96972" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=96972" title="Nebula">
Nebula

A nebula, which comes from the Latin word for mist or cloud, is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium, and other gases. 

An interstellar cloud is dust, plasma, or ionised gas in a galaxy. The Persian astronomer, Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, mentioned a true nebula for the first time in his book, "Book of Fixed Stars" (964). He said that there was a "little cloud" near the Andromeda Galaxy.

A nebula is usually made up of hydrogen gas and plasma. It may be the first stage of a star's cycle, but it may also be one of the last stages. 

Many nebulae or stars form from the gravitational collapse of gas in the interstellar medium or ISM. As the material collapses contracts, massive stars may form in the center, and their ultraviolet radiation ionises the surrounding gas, making it visible at optical wavelengths. 

Examples of these types of nebulae are the Rosette Nebula and the Pelican Nebula. The size of these nebulae, known as HII regions, varies depending on the size of the original cloud of gas. These are sites where star formation occurs. The formed stars are sometimes known as a young, loose cluster. 

Some nebulae are formed as the result of supernova explosions, the death throes of massive, short-lived stars. The materials thrown off from the supernova explosion are ionized by the energy and the compact object that it can produce. One of the best examples of this is the Crab Nebula, in Taurus. The supernova event was recorded in the year 1054 and is labelled SN 1054. The compact object that was created after the explosion lies in the center of the Crab Nebula and is a neutron star.

Other nebulae may form as planetary nebulae. This is the final stage of a low-mass star's life, like Earth's Sun. Stars with a mass up to 8-10 solar masses evolve into red giants and slowly lose their outer layers during pulsations in their atmospheres. When a star has lost enough material, its temperature increases and the ultraviolet radiation it emits can ionize the surrounding nebula that it has thrown off. The nebula is 97% Hydrogen and 3% Helium with trace materials. 

In the past galaxies and star clusters were also called 'nebulae'.

Using the database schema, it is possible to create a blueprint of the database. This blueprint will not contain any data. The database schema uses logical formulas to create integrity constraints. It is not possible to insert data into the database that violates these integrity constraints. All contraints use the same language.

Lunar eclipse

A Lunar eclipse is an astronomical phenomenon. It happens when the moon passes through the shadow of the Earth. Lunar eclipses happen about twice a year, much more often than solar eclipses. They also last longer than solar eclipses.

During a lunar eclipse, the Moon looks red-brown. You would probably think that the moon would be completely black because of Earth's shadow, but the reddish-brown color is because of the fact that the Sun's light reflects off of the Earth, and is barely visible on the Moon.

Like solar eclipses, there are different types of lunar eclipses. There are total eclipses, where all of the moon appears reddish-brown, and partial ones, where only part of the moon appears reddish-brown.

Lunar eclipses are not as rare as solar eclipses and are sometimes called the 'Yellow Moon' although it does not look very yellow.

Weimar Constitution

The Constitution of the German Reich (German: "Die Verfassung des Deutschen Reiches"), usually known as the Weimar Constitution ("Weimarer Verfassung") was the constitution that governed the Weimar Republic (1919-1933). The constitution technically remained in effect during the Third Reich from 1933 to 1945.

The German state's official name was "Deutsches Reich" until the adoption of the 1949 constitution. 

Following the end of World War I, a German National Assembly gathered in the town of Weimar, in the state of Thuringia, in January 1919 to write a constitution for the "Reich". The nation was to be a democratic federal republic, governed by a president and parliament.

The constitution was drafted by the lawyer and liberal politician "Hugo Preuss", who was then state secretary in the Ministry of the Interior and later became Minister of the Interior.

"Guitar Hero III Mobile" was programmed by Robinson Technologies (shortened to RTSoft), with help from MachineWorks Northwest LLC. The graphics for the game were made by Anthem Game Group.

Playing "Guitar Hero III Mobile" is similar to playing other games in the "Guitar Hero" series. "Mobile" uses 3 frets instead of 5. Each column of numbered keys on a phone's keypad is a fret. The numbered keys used are "1", "4", and "7" for green notes, "2", "5", and "8" for red notes, and "3", "6", and "9" for yellow notes. Once the note(s) reach the bottom, the player must play the note(s) by pressing or holding down the number key(s) in order to score points. Players can turn on Star Power to get more points by the "*" (star) button on the keypad or the "OK" button in the center of the directional pad.

"Guitar Hero III Mobile" has 15 songs to play from "Guitar Hero II" and "". Every month, more songs can be downloaded.

Not every polymath is interested in the same things, but they are all interested in a wide range of subjects. Other names for a polymath are "universal genius" and "Renaissance man". 

The term "Renaissance man" comes from the Renaissance period of European history, during the 1400s and 1500s. But polymaths have been known since ancient times.

The city of Atlanta started a new way of using 2-1-1 in 1997. This new way of using it was similar to how it is used now. After Atlanta, many other cities and states started to use it as a special number to call in an emergency. 5-1-1 is also used for this.

Toltec

Toltec is used by historians in different ways. It is either used to refer to certain people that lived in what is Mexico today, before Christopher Columbus came there. Some scholars also use the word to refer to the people that later developed into the Aztec civilisation. These people are only known from Aztec stories. It is not known if they actually formed one people or not.

Basilica

A basilica is a large, important church. The word can also be used for an Ancient Roman building that was used for law and meetings. The word "basilica" is Latin which was taken from the Greek "Basiliké Stoà".

Nowadays the word is used in three ways:

A Roman basilica was a large hall built for meetings, business and law. A Roman basilica usually had the doors at the long sides of the building. At each end was a semi-circular part where the judges sat. The building usually had two rows of columns, which made a high central part and a lower aisle on either side. The light came in from windows above the columns. As the Roman Empire spread, every city had a basilica.

Early in the 4th century AD (300s), the Roman Emperor Constantine made Christianity the legal religion of the Roman Empire. The Christians who had been worshipping secretly in private houses now wanted to build churches. They did not want the churches to look the same as Roman Temples. They built them to look more like Roman Basilicas. A basilica was a good plan for a Christian church because lots of people could fit inside, and the aisles were useful for people to move around. The semi-circular part at one end, the "apse", was just right to put the altar. Christian basilicas usually have the door at one end, rather than at the side. In front of the door there was often a courtyard called an "atrium". Most of these atriums have gone, but churches often have a town square or a market place in front of them.

Some of the oldest Early Christian basilicas were four that were begun in Rome by the Emperor Constantine. Three of them are still standing, but they have had many changes in the last 1,700 years. These are the basilicas of "Santa Maria Maggiore", "St. John Lateran" and "St. Paul's outside the Walls". The fourth basilica was "'Old St. Peter's" which was replaced in the 16th and 17th centuries by the present St. Peter's Basilica. Other Early Christian Basilicas were built in Greece and the Holy Land.

Some basilicas are called "Ancient Basilicas". These have been called basilicas since Early Christian or Medieval times. It is their traditional name. Ancient Basilicas include "the Church of the Holy Sepulchre" in Jerusalem, "the Basilica of San Vitale" in Ravenna and "the Basilica of San Lorenzo" in Rome. The four other "ancient basilicas" of Rome are called the "Major Basilicas". Each "Major Basilica" has a throne for the pope and an altar that is specially for the pope to celebrate mass. No-one else can use that altar without the pope's permission. All the other basilicas are called "Minor Basilicas".

Nowadays, for a church to be called a "Minor Basilica", it has to be given some special privileges or rights by the pope in a document called a "Papal Brief". When a church has been made a basilica, the clergy then carry some special symbols when they are in procession. There are more than 1,400 basilicas in the world.

 
Many churches are given the name "basilica" to show that they are special in some way. There are a very few ancient basilicas that were built on a place that was associated with Jesus. They are thought of as some of the holiest Christian sites in the world. These include "the Basilica of the Annunciation" in Nazareth, "the Basilica of All Nations" where Jesus prayed on the Mount of Olives and "the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre" in Jerusalem. "The Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre" is very unusual because the church is shared by the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.

Other ancient basilicas are places where a saint was martyred (put to death). One of these is "the Basilica of Saint Stephen", the first Christian Martyr, which is also in Jerusalem. There are many ancient basilicas which were built on the place where a saint was buried. In Rome there are many basilicas like this, because Rome was a very big city, with many Christian people. The Emperors thought Christianity was dangerous to them, because Christians put the rules of Jesus before the law of the Emperor. Many Christians were martyred. When Christianity became legal, churches were built over the graves of martyrs. These churches often became known as basilicas, because they were in the shape of a Roman basilica. Basilicas built over tombs of martyrs include "Sant'Agnese outside the Walls", "San Lorenzo outside the Walls", and "St. Paul's outside the Walls". The words "outside the walls" mean that the burial place of the saint was outside the walls of the city.

Some basilicas are famous because they have the "relics" (or bones or perhaps a body part) of a saint who did not die there and was not buried there. This can often mean that the body was stolen from the original place, because the people thought that owning a saint's body would bring good luck. In some ways this was true. If a church owned the body of an important saint, then many people would come on pilgrimage and would give money and gifts to the church. Basilicas that have stolen bodies include "St. Mark's", Venice, "St. Nicholas of Bari", also in Italy, and "the Basilica of St. Mary Magdalene" in Vezelay, France. Not all relics are bodies. Basilicas may also hold a famous object like a piece of the True Cross, or the belt worn by the Virgin Mary. People often ask whether all these precious relics are real. The Roman Catholic Church does not get into arguments about trying to prove whether the pieces of the Cross, the body parts and other things are real. Sometimes the relic is known to be real. Sometimes there is no way to prove it, either way.

Other basilicas are churches that were built by a famous saint, were used by a famous saint, or were built to honour the saint, who did not die as a martyr but lived a very holy life. Two of the most famous basilicas of this sort are "the Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi" and "the Basilica of St. Anthony of Padua". Many thousands of pilgrims go to these churches every day to remember two saints who were gentle, humble and taught people to live better lives.

Some basilicas are built because a miracle or special sign took place. The sign might be a vision. "The Basilica of Lourdes" in France is built at the place where a girl who is now called St. Bernadette had a vision of the Virgin Mary. The basilica at Lourdes is one of the most important pilgrimage places in France. Sometimes the sign is not so strange as a vision. In the Philippines, "the Basilica del Santo Niño" was built at the place where a partly burnt box was found in 1565. It contained a little statue of the Christ Child and had been left behind by some Spanish or Portuguese explorers many years earlier. "Santo Niño" means "Holy Child" in Spanish.

The four great Basilicas of Rome, as well as having a seat and an altar for the pope, have a "Holy Door" which is only opened for special occasions such as a Jubilee Year.

Middle-earth locations

This article is about the fictional locations, landscapes, mountains, rivers etc. from J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth universe.

Beleriand was a large region in northwestern Middle-earth until the end of the First Age. Beleriand is between the sea in the west and south, and the Blue Mountains in the east.
At the end of the First Age, Beleriand is destroyed and covered by the sea.

Eriador is a large region in Middle-earth. Is is between the Blue Mountains in the west, the Misty Mountains in the east, the Ice-bay of Forochel in the north, and the rivers Glanduin and Greyflood in the south.

In the earlier part of the Third Age much of Eriador was part of the kingdom of Arnor. Apart from Arnor, other settlements in Eriador of the Third Age were Rivendell, Bree-land and the Shire.

Rhovanion or Wilderland is a large region in Middle-earth. It is east of the Misty Mountains and south of the Grey Mountains and the Iron Hills. The river Anduin flows through it from the Grey Mountains to the Emyn Muil. A big part of Rhovanion is covered by the forest of Mirkwood.

Rhûn is a large region in Middle-earth. It is the lands east of Rhovanion, and around the Sea of Rhûn.

Harad or Haradwaith is the name for the lands south of Gondor and Mordor. The coasts of Harad were settled by the "Black Númenóreans". The peoples living in Harad were often influenced by Sauron and made war with the western realms. In the Fourth Age the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor made peace with Harad. In Harad also lived the elephant-like "mûmakil" (or oliphaunts).

Amon Hen (Sindarin: "Hill of the Eye") is a hill on the west side of the river Anduin, at the southern end of the long lake Nen Hithoel, by the Falls of Rauros. On the other, eastern side of the lake is the hill Amon Lhaw. On Amon Hen the Fellowship of the Ring was broken, and they went in different directions.

The Ered Luin (Sindarin: Blue Mountains), also known as Ered Lindon, are a mountain range in the far west of Eriador. Until the end of the First Age, the Ered Luin separated Beleriand and Eriador. In the middle of the mountain range is a gap, creating the Gulf of Lhûn/Lune, where the Grey Havens lie.

The Ered Mithrin (Sindarin: Grey Mountains) is mountain range to the north of Rhovanion. At the western end of the Grey Mountains is Mount Gundabad of the Misty Mountains, east of it lie the Iron Hills.

The Ered Nimrais (Sindarin: "Whitehorn Mountains") or White Mountains are a mountain range, which is between Gondor in the south and Rohan in the north. In its western part the White Mountains are separated from the Misty Mountains by the "Gap of Rohan", near which is the valley of Helm's Deep. Through the Mountains ran the "Paths of the Dead". The easternmost end of the White Mountains is the mountain Mindolluin, on which is the city of Minas Tirith.

The Misty Mountains (or Sindarin Hithaeglir) are a great mountain range, between Eriador in the west and Rhovanion in the east. At the southern end of the Misty Mountains is Isengard, at the northern end Mount Gundabad. Under the Misty Mountains is the old dwarven city Khazad-dûm.

Mount Doom (Sindarin: Amon Amarth) or Orodruin (Sindarin: "fiery mountain") is a volcano in northeastern Mordor. Inside the volcano are the Sammath Naur (or Cracks of Doom) where Sauron made the One Ring, and which is the only place where the Ring can be destroyed.

Weathertop (Sindarin Amon Sûl, "Hill of Wind") is a hill in Eriador; it is the southernmost and highest summit of the Weather Hills. The Weather Hills lie next to the Great East Road, about halfway between the Shire and Rivendell. 

On Weathertop was the Tower of Amon Sûl, a watch-tower built by the kingdom of Arnor. Oneof the "palantíri" was kept in the Tower. In T.A. 1409 the Tower was destroyed, and only ruins were left. In October T.A. 3018, Aragorn and the hobbits camped on Weathertop and were attacked by the Ringwraiths; Frodo Baggins was wounded by a Morgul-blade.

The Anduin is the largest river in Middle-earth. It comes out of the Grey Mountains and flows through Rhovanion and the Emyn Muil. There it goes through the rapids of Sarn Gebir and into the long lake Nen Hithoel, after which it falls down the Falls of Rauros. After that the river Anduin flows between the White Mountains and the Mountains of Shadow. It flows into the sea in a broad river delta, which is called the Mouths of Anduin or the Ethir Anduin.

Bruinen or Loudwater was a river in Eriador. It began in the Misty Mountains, and flowed south, through the valley of Rivendell, and into the river Mitheithel.

The Baranduin or Brandywine River is a river in Eriador. It begins out of Lake Evendim in northern Eriador, and flows south. It flows through the Shire, and at last into the sea.

Arnor was a human realm in Eriador. It was founded by Elendil and his people, who survived the Fall of Númenor towards the end of the Second Age. The peoples living in Arnor were the descendants of the Númenorean survivors, and the indigenous human peoples who had lived there before. The capital of Arnor was the city Annúminas on the shores of Lake Evendim in northern Eriador. Elendil became the first King of Arnor; after his death, his older son Isildur became King.

After the death of the tenth king, Eärendur, in T.A. 861, his three sons split Arnor into three new lands, one for each of them: Arthedain in the west, Cardolan in the south, and Rhudaur in the north. With time, all three countries were destroyed in wars against the northern land Angmar.
After the War of the Ring, the land again became part of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor, ruled by King Elessar Telcontar and his descentants.

Bree-land is a small region in Eriador, which is around the Breehill. It has four villages: Bree (the biggest), Archet, Combe and Staddle. The peoples living in the villages of Bree-land are Men and Hobbits; it is the only place where both people live together. The only other place inhabited by Hobbits is the Shire.
Bree is at the meeting point of two large roads, the Great East Road and the North-South Road, which made it an important centre of trade and travel.

The Lonely Mountain or Sindarin Erebor is a mountain in the northeast of Rhovanion. When the dwarves had to leave their ancient home Khazad-dûm, it became the new home of Durin's folk. They were led by Thráin I, who became "King under the Mountain". Later Erebor was attacked by the dragon Smaug, and the dwarves had to flee again. In the story told in "The Hobbit", the dragon Smaug is killed and the dwarves again return to the Lonely Mountain. Dáin II Ironfoot becomes new King under the Mountain.

Esgaroth or Lake-town or is a town in the northeast of Rhovanion. It is built at the Long Lake, south of the Lonely Mountain and east of Mirkwood. It was destroyed by the dragon Smaug, but was rebuilt.

Fangorn or Fangorn Forest is a large forest on the eastern side of the southern end of the Misty Mountains. Fangorn is the only known home of the Ents, a people of giant tree-like beings. The Sindarin word "Fangorn" translates to "Beardtree", and is also the Sindarin name of the Ent Treebeard.

Gondor was a human realm in southeastern Middle-earth. It was founded by the brothers Isildur and Anárion and their people, who had survived the Fall of Númenor towards the end of the Second Age.
In the later part of the Third Age, Gondor was between the sea in the south, the Mountains of Shadow in the east, and the White Mountains in the north; in earlier times the land of Gondor reached farther north. The city Osgiliath, built over the river Anduin, became the capital of Gondor. Isildur also founded the city Minas Ithil east of the Anduin, and his brother Anárion founded the city Minas Anor west of the Anduin on the mountain Mindolluin.

Gondor had several regions. Ithilien is in the east, between the river Anduin in the west and the Mountains of Shadow in the east. Anórien was a small land north of the White Mountains, between the river Anduin in the east and Rohan in the west. Calenardhon was the land north of the White Mountains, which later became Rohan in the 26th century T.A. Enedwaith was northwest of the White Mountains, which was mostly abandoned in the later part of the Third Age. Between the coast and the White Mountains were several regions, from the west to the Anduin in the east. Near the seashore in the south were the regions Anfalas, Belfalas, Dor-en-Ernil, Lebennin, and Lossarnach. Along the Mountains in the north were the Morthond Vale, Lamedon, and the Ringló Vale. Southeast of the Anduin was the region South Gondor.

After the "War of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men" against Sauron, Isildur left to rule the northern kingdom Arnor, while the son of Anárion stayed to rule Gondor.
In the 15th century there was a great civil war, the city Osgiliath was destroyed, and Minas Anor became the new capital.
During the time of the rule of King Eärnur, the Ringwraiths captured Minas Ithil, and it was renamed Minas Morgul. Minas Anor was renamed Minas Tirith ("Tower of Guard"). Both cities were in a constant state of war, much of the action taking place around or in the former capital of Osgiliath. During the War of the Ring, Gondorian-controlled Western Osgiliath fell to Mordor, allowing Sauron to attack Minas Tirith. The Orcs attacked the city, but the coming of the Rohirrim forced them to stop, allowing the defenders to charge the enemy. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields was won by the Men of Gondor and Rohan.

The last King, Eärnur, disappeared in 2050 of the Third Age. After this Gondor was ruled by the "Stewards of Gondor" instead of a king until the end of the Third Age.
After the War of the Ring, the land became part of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor, ruled by King Elessar Telcontar and his descendants.

The Great East Road is an ancient Dwarven road, which ran from western Beleriand, over the Ered Luin, through the Shire, to the Misty Mountains, and to the dwarven lands in the east.

Helm's Deep was a deep valley on the north side of the western part of the White Mountains, south to the "Gap of Rohan". The valley was blocked by a natural series of hills called Helm's Dike. Behind this lay a fortress: the Hornburg. At the end of the valley is the entrance to the Glittering Caves.

Isengard is a fortress at the southern end of the Misty Mountains. It is a small valley inside a ring-shaped wall, the Ring of Isengard, and in its middle is a tall black tower, Orthanc.
It belonged to Gondor, but in the 28th century it was given to Saruman. In the War of the Ring the Ents destroyed the ring-wall. After the War, the tower Orthanc was given back to King Elessar and the Reunited Kingdom.

Khazad-dûm was the ancient home of the Dwarves under the Misty Mountains. It was a great underground city and mines. It was the only place in Middle-earth where the precious metal "mithril" could be found, which made the dwarves very rich.
Khazad-dûm was founded by Durin the Deathless early in the First Age, long before the rise of the Sun and Moon. 

In the Third Age the dwarves woke a Balrog deep in the mines of Khazad-dûm. The Balrog killed King Durin VI and many Dwarves, and the surviving Dwarves had to flee and left for other places. Khazad-dûm got a new name, Moria, which is Sindarin for "dark pit".

Lothlórien was an elven realm, between the Misty Mountains and the Anduin. It lay on the land between the rivers Anduin and Silverlode, close to the dwarven realm Khazad-dûm. Lothlórien was founded in the Second Age, and Amdír became the first King. The elves of Lothlórien fought in the War of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men against Sauron. In the war Amdír was killed, and his son Amroth became king after him, but Amroth later left Lothlórien. Since then until the end of the Third Age it was ruled by Lord Celeborn and Lady Galadriel. Caras Galadhon was the main city of Lothlórien. Other names of Lothlórien are the shortened form Lórien, and the names Laurelindórenan, Dwimordene (Rohirric), or The Golden Wood.

Mordor (Sindarin: "Black Land" and Quenya: "Land of Shadow") is a land in the southeastern part of Middle-earth, east of the Anduin. It is the land of Sauron in the Second and Third Age.
Mordor is surrounded by mountain ranges: the Ered Lithui (Sindarin: "Mountains of Ash") in the north, the Ephel Dúath (Sindarin: Mountains of Shadow) in the west and another mountain range in the south. At the foothills of the Ered Lithui in northwestern Mordor was Sauron's main fortress Barad-dûr. Southwest of Barad-dûr lay the volcano Mount Doom.
Great parts of Mordor are a wasteland. The southern part of Mordor, around the Sea of Núrnen was more fertile and used as farmland, to produce food for Sauron's armies.

Mirkwood is a large forest in Rhovanion. Originally it was known as Greenwood the Great (Sindarin: "Eryn Galen"). 

In the Second Age an Elven people settled in the Greenwood, founding the Woodland Realm, with its capital on the hill Amon Lanc. After the end of the Second Age, the Elves went to live farther north. In the 11th century of the Third Age, Sauron settled himself in the hill-fortress of Dol Guldur on Amon Lanc in the south of the forest. His evil influence darkened the woods, although it lessened towards the north; after this the forest became known as "Mirkwood". After the War of the Ring the forest was cleared of Sauron's influence and became known as Eryn Lasgalen (Sindarin: "Wood of Greenleaves").

The North-South Road is a long road running from the realm of Arnor in the north to Gondor in the south. The road began in the city Fornost Erain, the capital of Arthedain, crossed the Great East Road at Bree, and ran farther to the southern end of the Misty Mountains. There the road turned east, towards the cities Minas Tirith, to Osgiliath, and ended at Minas Ithil.
A part of the road south of Bree is also known as the Greenway.

Rivendell (Sindarin: Imladris, Westron: "Karningul") was an elven city in eastern Eriador. It was founded in the Second Age by Elrond, who ruled it until the end of the Third Age.

Rohan or the Riddermark (or short The Mark) was a human realm in southeastern Middle-earth, north of Gondor. Rohan lay north of the White Mountains, southeast of Isengard and southwest of the Emyn Muil. Originally it was a part of Gondor, and named Calenardhon. The capital of Rohan is Edoras, with the king's hall Meduseld.

But because of the plague in 1636 T.A. and the later wars, Calenardhon was mostly empty and very few people lived there. In 2509 T.A. the Rohirrim came south from the north, to help Gondor fight against a combined invasion of Men from the north-east and Orcs from Mordor. The Rohirrim helped Gondor win the "Battle of the Field of Celebrant" and the war. As a reward, Steward Cirion of Gondor gave the land Calenardhon to the Rohirrim. The King of the Rohirrim, Eorl the Young, swore the "Oath of Eorl": that Rohan would come and help Gondor, if it needed help in its wars. Afterwards, the people of the Rohirrim moved into their new land, which they named the "Riddermark" or just "The Mark". Gondor called the land "Rohan" (Sindarin: "Land of the Horse-lords").

The Shire is a land in Eriador. It is settled by Hobbits. Its name in Westron was Sûza "Shire" or Sûzat "The Shire". Its name in Sindarin was i Drann.
The Shire was settled by the Hobbits in the 24th century of the Third Age. It is divided into four "Farthings": the North-, West-, South- and Eastfarthing. The leaders of the Shire were "the Mayor" of Michel Delving, "the Thain" from Tuckborough and "the Master of Buckland".

Númenor was a huge star-shaped island west of Middle-earth in the Second Age. At the beginning of the Age it was given to the human peoples who had helped the elves in the wars against Morgoth. In the middle of the island was the mountain Meneltarma, which was a holy place for the Númenoreans. Númenor was divided into six regions, one in each "star-arm" and one in the middle. The regions were Forostar ("Northlands"), Andustar ("Westlands"), Hyarnustar ("Southwestlands"), Hyarrostar ("Southeastlands"), Orrostar ("Eastlands"), and the central region Mittalmar ("Inlands").
In eastern Mittalmar was the region Arandor ("Kingsland"), with the capital city Armenelos, and the haven Rómenna. 

Their first king was Elros Tar-Minyatur, brother of Elrond. Númenor became the most powerful nation of Men. But later many Númenoreans, including their kings, became power-hungry and became enemies of the elves. Towards the end of the Second Age, when it was ruled by King Ar-Pharazôn the Golden, Númenor was destroyed and sank in the sea, similar to the legendary Atlantis. Only a group of Númenoreans led by Elendil, the "Elendili" ("Elf-friends") or "the Faithful", could escape the destruction of Númenor and came to Middle-earth, where they founded the realms Arnor and Gondor. The "Akallabêth" is the story of Númenor's history and downfall.

Some of the many names of Númenor were "Westernesse", "Númenórë" (Quenya, the long form of "Númenor") and "Anadûnê" (Adûnaic), both meaning "West-land"; "Andor" (Quenya) and "Yôzâyan" (Adûnaic), which both mean "the Land of the Gift". Later it was also called "Atalantë" (Quenya) and "Akallabêth" (Adûnaic), both meaning "the Downfallen".

Parliamentary system

A parliamentary system of government means that the executive branch of government must have the direct or indirect support of the parliament. This support is usually shown by a vote of confidence. The relationship between the executive and the legislature in a parliamentary system is called responsible government.

The separation of powers between the executive and law making branches, is not as obvious as it is in a presidential system, so there are different ways of balancing powers between the three branches which govern the country (the executive (or ministers), the law makers and the judges).

Parliamentary systems usually have a "head of government" and a "head of state". The head of government is the prime minister, and the head of state often being an elected (either popularly or through parliament) president or hereditary monarch.

Political asylum

Someone may ask for a political asylum when it is frightened to live in his own country. He then will go to another country. If he is allowed to live in the new country this is called "political asylum". 

The political asylum is one of the human rights, and a rules of international law. All countries who have agreed to the "United Nations Conventions Relating to the Status of Refugees" must let people, who do qualify, come into their country. 

People who qualify for asylum are those who can show that they might be badly treated in their own country because of their:

People who are given political asylum are called refugees. They are often confused with "economic refugees". Economic refugees are people who move from a poor country to a richer one so that they may work and make more money, often to send back to their families. Economic refugees are often an easy target for some politicians and newspapers who say that economic refugees take jobs from people who live in the host country. These politicians and newspapers do not show that there is a difference between economic refugees, who "want" live in another country to make money, and political refugees who "must" live in another country to be safer.

Cheung and Tse were first reported to be "getting back together" in early 2006 and on July 31 that year, Tse officially admitted dating Cheung in an interview with Commercial Radio Hong Kong 881/903. In September, the same year, Tse showed off his wedding ring at the Hong Kong International Airport, announcing he and Cheung had been married in a secret wedding ceremony in the Philippines.

On the 8 January 2007 episode of TVB's "Entertainment Scoop (東張西望)", Cheung was publicly confirmed by Nicholas' father, Patrick Tse to be approximately three months pregnant with the couple's first child. A March episode of "Entertainment Scoop (東張西望)" said that their child is due in August. It is confirmed by Nicholas Tse that she is expecting a baby boy.

On 2 August, it was reported that Cheung and Tse were both in the maternity ward waiting for their child to be born. However no specific photo was enclosed with such report. The very next day, Cecilia gave birth to a baby boy named Lucas.

In January and February 2008 many explicit photos were found online involving Cecilia Cheung and Edison Chen. The scandal also involved Gillian Chung and Bobo Giglioti.

5-1-1

5-1-1 is a special telephone number in the United States and some parts of Canada. It is made to be easy to remember. People can dial the number on a landline phone or on a mobile phone to get information about traffic and travel. 

In March 2001, there were more than three hundred phone numbers about traffic and travel. This was confusing to many people, because so many numbers existed, or were there, for the same thing. To fix this, the United States Department of Transportation (called the USDOT) asked the Federal Communications Commission (called the FCC) for a special N11 code. On July 21, 2000, the FCC made 5-1-1 the national telephone number for travel information.

Fulda

Fulda () is a city in Hesse, Germany; it is located on the Fulda River and is the administrative seat of the Fulda district ("Kreis").

The Benedictine monastery of Fulda was founded in 744 by Saint Sturm, a disciple of Saint Boniface, when Boniface was reorganising the church in Germany.

﻿From its foundation, the abbey Fulda and its territory was subject only to the German emperor, not to the control of the local lords. Fulda was made a bishopric in 1752 and the prince-abbots were given the additional title of prince-bishop. The prince-abbots (and later prince-bishops) ruled Fulda and the surrounding region until the bishopric was forcibly dissolved by Napoleon in 1802.
From 1764 until 1789 Fulda had a porcelain factory. Because of its quality and rarity, it is much prized by collectors. The factory was begun under Prince-Bishop, Prince-Abbot Heinrich von Bibra and closed down shortly after his death by his successor, Prince-Bishop, Prince-Abbot Adalbert von Harstall.

Japan is asking for return of Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and Habomai shoto. They say that these islands are being illegally held by Russia. Several political parties in Japan are asking for return of all Chishima Islands. Russia has said that it would return Shikotan and Habomai shoto in 1956 but Japan did not agree to this agreement because it would mean the United States would keep the island of Okinawa.

Luna Lovegood

Luna Lovegood is a fictional character in the Harry Potter books written by J. K. Rowling. She's in Ravenclaw and first appears in the movies and the books is in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Many people in the Harry Potter series think she is a strange girl. This has led to her having the nickname "Loony Lovegood", but she does not change herself. She is the daughter of Xenophilius Lovegood, and live near to the Weasley's house, in a black tower.

In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry first meets Luna on the Hogwarts Express train where is is described as having waist-length dirty blonde hair and a distant look. Harry thinks that she is odd because she was reading The Quibbler upside-down, and wearing a necklace made of butterbeer corks and radish earrings. When Harry first sees the Thestrals (horse like creatures that can fly) pulling the carts, Luna tells him that she can see them too. Both Harry and Luna could see the Thestrals when most others could not because they had both seen someone die and Thestrals can only be seen by someone who has seen a death. Later, Luna tells Harry that she and her father believe him about the conspiracy involving Harry, and that they support him. When Harry forms Dumbledore's Army Luna joins and gets better at defensive magic. When Gryffindor's Quidditch team played Hufflepuff, Luna supported Gryffindor by making a life size lion hat that roared. Later in the book when Harry was going to contact Kreacher about the location of Sirius Black, Luna kept watch for him, telling everyone that there was a gas leak. When Professor Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad (a group of students who were given power over other students to punish) found him, Luna was captured and held by a Slythern, while being held, Harry saw her looking out the window, as if she was bored. After they had escaped, it was Luna's idea to travel to the Ministry of Magic by Thestral. During the battle at the Department of Mysteries Luna took an active part in the fighting. After Sirius's death Harry noted that Luna was the only person that could truly comfort him about it, because, like Harry, Luna had also lost someone close to her, her mother. 

Harry first meets Luna again on the Hogwarts Express when he sits with her in a compartment, with Neville Longbottom some admirers of Harry's say that he could sit with them, Harry declines saying that Luna and Neville "are cool". Later in the year, near Christmas, Harry invited Luna to be his guest at Professor Slughorn's party, Harry notes that she looks pretty, she wore a "spangled silver dress", while at the party she talked to vampires and shared her off-beat beliefs. Soon after the Party, Luna was the commentator at a Quidditch match, in which she went off on side topics by saying that the player Smith suffered from "Losers Lurgy" and she also pointed out oddly shaped clouds, and often forgot players names. At the end of the year, Luna patrolled the corridors in search of Death Eaters.

Harry first meets Luna this time at Bill and Fleur's wedding, in which she and her father, Xenophilius Lovegood wore "egg yolk" yellow robes. Later Luna was captured on the Hogwarts Express by Death Eaters because her father wrote the truth about Harry in The Quibbler. Harry assists Luna out of Malfoy Manor, where she had been taken hostage, and she comforted Mr. Ollivander (who had also been taken prisoner because Voldemort needed information from him), by sharing her beliefs. At Dobby's funeral Luna gave a nice speech which calmed everyone, thanking Dobby for rescuing them all from Malfoy Manor. Later when Harry had to find Ravenclaw's lost diadem, Luna escorted Harry into the Ravenclaw common room, where she also stunned a Death Eater. At the Battle of Hogwarts she cast her Hare Patronus, which made several approaching Dementors leave, and she also fought Bellatrix Lestrange. After the Battle, Luna made a so that Harry could be alone.

J.K. Rowling said in an interview that Luna became the "Wizard equivalent of a naturalist", and she married fellow naturalist Rolf Scamander, and had twin boys, Lorcan, and Lysander.

Gackt

Gackt Camui ( 神威 楽斗 Kamui Gakuto ) is a Japanese musician, songwriter and actor. Usually referred to by his stage name Gackt, he is best known for his work with Malice Mizer and his following career as a solo artist. Besides Japanese language, he has performed in English, Korean, Cantonese and Mandarin.

Gackt was born in Okinawa, Japan on 4 July. Although he claims to be born in the year 1540, there has been speculation that he was born in 1973. As the second of three children, with an older sister and a younger brother. His father and mother were music teachers who played various instruments with his father primarily playing the trumpet. According to his autobiography, he was a mischievous child and enjoyed taking risks; at age seven he nearly drowned while swimming off the coast of Okinawa. After this near-death experience, he claimed to have the ability to see and speak with the deceased, a notion which was dismissed by his parents. At the age of ten, Gackt was hospitalized with a gastrointestinal tract and had to remain at the hospital for a prolonged time. He made the acquaintance of several terminally ill children, some of whom died during his stay.

Gackt's musical education began at age three, when his parents initiated his classical piano education, of which he grew tired four years later. It would take another four years until his parents allowed him to quit. Competition with a friend lead to Gackt taking back up the piano, and he was later encouraged to learn other various instruments, especially those used in a rock band, throughout the rest of his time in school.

In 1995, Gackt joined Malice Mizer as the group's vocalist, lyricist and pianist. Fan base and record sales grew substantially over the following years. Malice Mizer released two albums with Gackt ("Voyage ~Sans Retour~" and "Merveilles") along with seven singles. According to Gackt, when he began taking on more roles in the band, he was asked to leave the group. However, the other members of the band say that this is not true and that Gackt simply "disappeared" after waiting for him once their break was over.

Gackt began his solo career on 12 May 1999 with the release "Mizerable". Several albums, singles and videos have since followed. He has also done voice acting and motion capturing and co-wrote and co-starred in the 2003 movie "Moon Child", which also stars Hyde (vocalist of L'Arc~en~Ciel) and Wang Lee Hom (Taiwanese-American actor-singer) . Also in 2003, Gackt published his autobiography titled "Jihaku" and for Caparison Guitars, he has designed two guitars, named "Marcury" and "Venus".

Since 7 January 2007, Gackt has been playing the warlord Uesugi Kenshin in the TV drama "Fūrinkazan" Gackt's most recent solo release is the single "Returner ~Yami no Shuuen~", released on June 20, 2007, which was the first in the artist's career (both solo and in a band) to reach the number one spot on the Japanese Oricon charts.. Gackt was also the voice actor for Malthazar in the Japanese release of the film "Arthur and the Minimoys".

On 19 December, Gackt released an album titled "0079-0088" containing 8 tracks, which had either previously been used on the soundtracks of the "Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam" movies or were covers of earlier songs from the "Gundam" franchise. It was created as a tribute to the creator of "Gundam", Yoshiyuki Tomino, for his birthday.

On 25 May 2007, the formation of the supergroup Skin was announced, which also consists of Miyavi, Sugizo and Yoshiki. The group gave its debut performance at the Anime Expo convention in Long Beach, California on 29 June 2007 and plans to release an album. According to a recent blog post by Miyavi, the band has already started recording.

GacktJob is Gackt's live support band. Its current lineup is as follows:

 I believe in you. Yes, I do. You tell'em sister! 17:42, 22 May 2008 (UTC)


Hi, I'd like to offer myself as a new CheckUser. I have been editing since November 2006, and have had adminship nearly a year. As well as my experience on this project, I am an admin on English Wikipedia, Commons and Meta, as well as a bureaucrat on Meta. With regards to checkuser, I have not held that position anywhere before, but I have had similar level of trust – for example, through being an OTRS agent I regularly deal with sensitive private information. I am fully aware of the in this respect, and of course of the , both of which I will fully respect if/when I make checks. Additionally, I was one of the original proposers of making local checkusers for this project – I didn't run in September with Creol, Eptalon and M7 because I wasn't as experienced, not as active and also not old enough :) With Creol now a bureaucrat, I think an additional CheckUser would be beneficial to help spread the workload, and I believe I have the necessary skills to do a good job. Thanks. ("") 19:56, 26 April 2008 (UTC)




 - Do we really need another CheckUser? I mean, and I may be wrong, but I don't see a vast increase in sockpuppetry and the like. If there was an increase, then, sure, I would . But as it is so sensitive, what is the point in giving it to more people, when it is not required to do so. If someone were to leave, maybe. However, I do not feel comfortable in doing so. My case in a nutshell - "If it 'ain't broken, don't fix it." The smaller the amount of CheckUsers, the better.

I am withdrawing from this RfA. I will not try again.

I believe that it is now time for another request for adminship. I believe that I have completely redefined 
the reasoning behind the reason that I want to attain the sysop flag. I believe that I have completely worked on everything that others saw in me the last time. While many people say that I still make mistakes, this is what I have to say to them: Isn't it in a human's nature to make mistakes? If everyone didn't make mistakes, then how could they learn from them? I believe that that is the case. Even though I still request deletion for pages that don't really need to be deleted, I believe that I haven't been doing that nearly as much as I have in the past nor without thought. Every single QD tag I have placed since my last RfA has been thought about for 5 minutes before I request it for deletion. I make sure that they conform to the before I request deletion and if it doesn't meet the deletion policy, then I work on the article to make it more fit for this Wikipedia. Ever since my last request, I have mulled over the things that people said that I needed to work on and that is exactly what I have done:



Some people may think that requesting adminship every month and a half means that I am eager to become an administrator, and to those people, I would like to say this: That is not the case. I simply believe that a month and a half is the perfect amount of time to work on the things brought up in the previous RfA, address them, work on them, and fix them so that it isn't the problem for the next RfA.

Thank you for reading this long request.

Closed early per on April 13th.
Hello There. I would like to nominate myself for administrator. I feel that I am at the point where i have reached a significant understanding of the way in which Simple English Wikipedia and it's community works. Since starting here, over three months ago, I have observed the various requests of admin and have read through all of the critiscism and advice left for other users and have taken them in myself enabling me to become a better user. My main area of concern for Simple Wikipedia is to concentrate on my , including all encompassing areas under this, such as the community which served it, the relevant articles, referencing and further research and providing a base work for which the community could continue to build, develop and make use from. 

One of my Other main areas of concentration for Simple Wikipedia is reverting and dealing with vandilism, I classify myslef as a recent Changes Patroller. I believe that I would find the rollback tool very useful in dealing with these issues and helping to carry the increasing strain of vandilism off of the current admin community.

I, due to school work pressure and issues concerning my late brother's death not long ago, am not currently as active as I used to be and not online as much as I could be. However, with the increasing strain of Vandilism on this Wikipedia as it gains populartiy amongst both editors and tolls, i feel that every little effort in the fight against vandilism will help to keep this wikipedia running sefely and smoothly. By Next month, I hope to be editing in full swing once again and hope that I will be able to recieve admin tools in time for my full return after the closure of my borther's death after his funneral. I find that Simple Wikipedia is a place of refuge for me in difficult times at home. I feel that I could be a very productive and helpful editor here if given the chance to use administrator tools.

I feel that my experience of being here whilst the Iamandrewrice/benniguy/Inkpen2 fiasco was in full swing has given me knowledge on how to deal with severe cases such as this one, experienced not too long ago. I also feel that my specialist and first hand knowledge in certain areas, such as music, (being a trumpet player in an orchestra, participating in musicals, studying music to an advanced level in my curriculum at school and having a fantastic intrest in music in general), Film, (my Auntie being a film editor and Film studies being a part of my curriculum at school) and Food (Having done my work experience in a Catering company and my father being a professional chef) gives me a unique and hopefully valued postion her at Simple Wikipedia.
I frequently read the rules of Simple Wikipedia and am familier with all important policies and feel that I could be a valued administator in time. Thank You for reading. 15:14, 11 April 2008 (UTC)

"Candidate's acceptance: No, I never accepted this - what are you all doing!!"

Creol says something that is actually worth opposing for, so I'll abstain now. ("") 00:28, 12 April 2008 (UTC)

See previous nominations:

Ended on "13 April 2008" 10/9 (with IuseRosary's vote), 10/8, without, 52.9% support (with), 59% support (without) 

I would like to nominate myself for adminship again. It's been one month since my last nomination and I believe that I have made big steps in improvement in those areas that have been crucial for an administrator's job. I believe that I have been correctly tagging articles for deletion that need it; I also believe that I have learned about blocking. A block is not needed unless the user in question is being disruptive to the integrity of the Simple English Wikipedia. Protecting pages is not needed unless it is a frequent vandal target and even then, shouldn't be protected unless the mass amount of vandalism is frequent and recent (within a few days). I do not believe that I have been actively pursuing the FBI idea anymore, and I have practically ceased to use the WP:ViP page because there haven't been any IP's worth reporting lately. I believe that I have learned enough of the policies to be able to fill the role of administrator completely now. I also believe that I have started taking a look at every angle of a problem that occurs before posting a reply and that I have been objective and un-biast throughout the revolving issues that have been going on currently., and even though Tygrrr says that I should wait until one of the other respectable users here notices that I am ready because I believe that I am way past being ready, yet no one seems to have noticed it, so I decided to post up this self-nomination. 20:39, 6 April 2008 (UTC)

Pyroclastic flow

A pyroclastic flow (also known as a pyroclastic density current)is a common result of volcanic eruptions. The flows are currents of hot gas, or "tephra", during an eruption that sometimes causes rock falls.

They are extremely dangerous and mostly deadly.

Mudflow

A mudflow or mudslide occurs when mud travels down a slope very fast. Mudflows, which are like giant moving mud pies, happen when lots of water mixes with soil and rock. The water makes the slippery mass of mud flow quickly down. Mudflows happen most in mountainous places where a long dry season is followed by heavy rains. 

Mudflows of volcanic eruptions are the most dangerous, and are called lahars. A lahar is a type of mudflow or debris flow composed of a slurry of pyroclastic material, rocky debris, and water. The material flows down from a volcano, typically along a river valley. Lahars can move as quickly as 80km/h and are as thick as liquid concrete.

Lahars have several possible causes:
Lahars can occur without volcanic activity, if conditions are right for the collapse and movement of mud from existing volcanic ash deposits.

Class (programming)

A class is a part of a computer program that a programmer creates to represent a thing in a way that a computer can understand. A class is written in a programming language and a programming language that can be used to write classes is called an Object-oriented programming language. Classes have fields, which represent a quality the thing has, and classes have methods, which represent what a thing can do. 

For example, a class could be a car, which could have a color field, four tire fields, and a drive method.
Another, related class could be a truck, which would have similar fields, but not be exactly the same as a car.
Both a car and a truck could be a kind of a third class which could be called a vehicle class. In this way, the programmer could create the parts of the program that are the same for both the car and the truck in programming the vehicle class, yet the programmer would be free to program how a car is different from a truck without duplicating all of the programming.

In this example, there are three classes: 1) a class called "car", 2) a class called "pick-up truck", and 3) a class called "vehicle". These classes would be used to make (computer science) object. Although there is only one class called "car", there could be many objects that are created from the class called "car". And, although there is only one class that is called "truck", many objects of type truck could be created from this class. The class, vehicle, is actually general and there would probably not be any objects that were only of the class "vehicle". But a car would be a kind of vehicle and a truck would also be a kind of vehicle. So, you could say that both cars and trucks are from the same class, vehicle.

Inside of classes are two kinds of things: methods and fields (or properties). Methods can store the code for doing actions; in this example you could have a drive method and a brake method, and maybe a turnRight and turnLeft method. Fields store data; you could have a color field, a speed field and a size field. You can call methods by first making an object of the Car or Truck class, and call it for example ferrari, and doing ferrari.methodName(). In this case, if we wanted to make the vehicle move, we could do ferrari.drive().

Loggerhead Sea Turtle

The Loggerhead Sea Turtle, or "Loggerhead", is a type of turtle that lives in the sea. It is from the animal family Cheloniidae. Its other (scientific) name is "Caretta caretta". This name comes from the French word "caret" which means "sea turtle". 

Loggerheads live in the seas around the world. Most of the beaches where Loggerheads lay eggs are found on the coasts of the United States in North America (mostly in Florida), Oman in Asia, and Australia in the Pacific Ocean. Some Loggerheads also live near other countries like Chile, Greece, and Indonesia.

Loggerheads eat fish, squid, jellyfish, crabs, and other small sea animals. Loggerheads mate while they are moving in the seas mostly from March to June every 2 or 3 years. When they are ready to lay eggs female Loggerheads always come back to the same beach where they came out of their eggs as babies. Most loggerheads lay eggs in June and July. Most lay between 100 and 126 eggs. The eggs look much like ping-pong balls.

When they come out of the eggs baby Loggerheads are called "hatchlings". They usually come out at night so that other animals, like birds and crabs, do not eat them. The hatchlings follow light from the morning sun to the sea. They swim out to parts of the ocean that have seaweed (plants that grow in the sea) to hide from other animals while they grow.

Most Loggerheads move to warm waters during months that are colder but some hibernate, or sleep for long times, when it is cold. When they are hibernating they can stay under the water for up to seven hours before coming up for air.

Loggerheads live 30 to 50 years or more.

In the past Loggerhead Sea Turtles were hunted by people for meat and for their eggs. Also their fat and shells were used to make medicines, combs, and other things. The number of Loggerheads today is small and so governments in many countries have laws that do not allow them to be hunted anymore.

The main danger for Loggerheads now is the nets used by fishermen which can accidentally kill the turtles. They are also killed by boats, fishing hooks, and other dangers from people.

Today many organizations send people to find Loggerhead nests and protect the eggs. They count many turtles come out of the eggs and take care of any that are sick. These people do not try to help hatchlings that are not sick go to the ocean. The exercise that the hatchlings get from walking to the sea is an important part of their development.

Islamic Golden Age

The Islamic Golden Age, also sometimes known as the Islamic Renaissance, lasted from the 8th century to the 13th century. Some scholars think one should count even the 15th and the 16th centuries to this period. 

This period was called "Golden Age", because engineers, scholars and traders in the Islamic world did much for the arts, agriculture, economics, industry, law, literature, navigation, philosophy, sciences, and technology in this time. They built upon earlier traditions and added inventions and innovations of their own. Howard R. Turner writes: "Muslim artists and scientists, princes and laborers together created a unique culture that has directly and indirectly influenced societies on every continent."

<doc id="97356" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97356" title="Gian Lorenzo Bernini">
Gian Lorenzo Bernini

Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini (1598-1680) (known as Gianlorenzo Bernini) was one of the greatest artists of the Italian Baroque period. He was famous both for his sculpture and his architecture. From 1527, he worked for Pope Urban XIII and then for Pope Alexander VII at St. Peter's Basilica where he designed the famous "piazza" (place) in front of the basilica and many of the most splendid things that are inside. 

Bernini was born in Naples, Italy. He was the son of Pietro Bernini (1562-1629) who was a well known sculptor. When he was about 7 years old, his father took him to Rome. 

As a boy and as a young man living in Rome, he saw the works of many famous artists. He saw the famous fresco paintings on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel by Michelangelo, one of the most famous artists of the 1500s. The paintings told the Bible story of Creation. He saw the huge dome of St. Peter's Basilica which Michelangelo designed and the new extension to the building that was being built by Carlo Maderna.

One artist who Bernini knew well was Annibale Carracci who painted scenes on the ceilings of rooms for the pope. The scenes told stories, often Ancient Roman legends. Carracci took Bernini into St. Peter's Basilica. Bernini fell on his knees and decided at that moment that he wanted to make something beautiful and splendid to honour Saint Peter. 

Another artist whose work Bernini saw was Caravaggio. Caravaggio's paintings were nothing like Carracci's. Carracci's pictures were bright, lively and colourful. Caravaggio's pictures were dark, sad and often frightening. But looking into Caravaggio's paintings was like looking at something that was really happening while you were watching. The people in Caravaggio's paintings looked as if they could breathe, speak and feel pain. 

By the time he was 20, Bernini was a sculptor, carving statues out of marble. He had learnt a lot, not just how to carve marble, which he learnt from his father, but how to make figures that told stories like Carracci's and Michelangelo's and seemed to be alive, like Caravaggio's. An important man in the Roman Catholic Church, Cardinal Scipione Borghese, saw his work and became his patron, paying Bernini to make many beautiful sculptures for him and his family. Soon the cardinal's uncle got to hear about Bernini. He was Pope Urban VIII, the most powerful man in Italy. He asked Bernini to work for him at St. Peter's Basilica. Bernini spent 40 years of his life there, all the time except for a trip to France and shorter visits to other cities.

Most sculptures of that time were just of one figure. But Bernini had seen Michelangelo's famous sculpture of the "Pieta" which showed the Virgin Mary grieving over the body of her dead son, Jesus. Bernini made figures that were in groups and told stories. One of his famous groups comes from Roman Mythology. It shows the god, Apollo chasing a beautiful wood nymph (a sort of fairy) that he had fallen in love with. But her father had magic powers and suddenly turned his daughter into a tree. Bernini sculptured the very moment when her toes are turning into roots, her legs are becoming the trunk, and leaves are sprouting out of her hands and long hair. She has her mouth open and a look of horror on her face. No-one had ever tried to carve anything like that in marble before. The thing that is so amazing about Bernini's sculpture is that he has made the flesh, the wood, the leaves and the hair all look so real, even though they are all carved in white stone. 

Bernini's most famous sculpture is "St. Theresa in Ecstasy". It tells the story of a saint who had a vision of an angel. Her vision was so beautiful that she fainted. Bernini has sculptured the vision, with St. Theresa lying on a cloud with the laughing angel in front of her. Their robes are blowing around, and it is hard to believe that the whole scene, which is set against a wall, is not really floating. Bernini did not just design the statues. He also designed the walls of the chapel around it, which is like a stage-set, made of beautifully patterned marble. Against another wall, he carved a balcony and several white marble people looking at the scene. They are members of the family that paid for the chapel. 

The city of Rome has lots of squares with fountains in them. Pope Alexander wanted to make the city more beautiful, so during his time, more fountains were made. One of the biggest squares in Rome was the Piazza Navona. On one side of the piazza was the church of St. Agnes, built by Borromini. Bernini thought it was an ugly building. He was asked to make the ""Fountain of the Rivers"" in the square, right outside the church. It has four figures who are symbols of four rivers. Bernini carved one of river-figures looking up at the church and throwing his hands in the air in shock at its ugliness. Borromini was very upset with Bernini's joke, which has been there now for more than 300 years.

Bernini's first work at St. Peter's was to design the "baldacchino" which is like a tent or "pavilion" above the High Altar. This amazing thing is 30 metres (98 ft) tall and is probably the largest piece of bronze in the world. It stands underneath Michelangelo's dome and has four huge bronze twisted columns decorated with olive leaves and bees, because bees were the symbol of Pope Urban. Pope Urban had a niece that he loved very much and he got Bernini to put her face and the face of her new-born baby boy on the columns as well.

Holding up the dome of the Basilica were four enormous stone pillars (piers). Bernini had a great idea for the big piers. He had four hollow "niches" carved into them where four huge statues could stand. This sent some people into a panic because they thought the dome would fall down, but it did not. 

The basilica owns some precious relics: a piece of the True Cross of Jesus, a veil that a woman wiped the face of Jesus with, while he was carrying the cross, the spear that was used to pierce Jesus side, and the bones of St. Andrew, the brother of St. Peter. No-one knows for sure whether these things are real or not, but for hundreds of years they have been precious. Bernini's plan was the make four marble statues of the four Holy people: St. Helena who found the cross, St. Longinus who was the soldier with the spear, St Veronica who wiped Jesus' face and St. Andrew. Even though the design is Bernini's, the statues, which are all 5 metres high, were made by four different sculptors. Only St. Longinus is the work of Bernini. 
Bernini's next job was to make a special throne out of bronze, to hold an ancient wood and ivory throne that had been at the basilica for more than 500 years. It is called the "Cattedra Petri" or "throne of St. Peter". The bronze throne, with the old wooden throne inside it, is held up high at the end of the basilica, by four important saints who are called "Doctors of the Church" because they were all great writers and teachers. The statues are made of bronze. They are Saints Ambrose and Augustine for the Church of Rome and Saints Athanasius and John Chrysostum for the Orthodox Church. Above the chair is a window which is made not from glass but thin translucent stone called alabaster. The Dove of the Holy Spirit is in the middle of the window with rays of light spreading out into the basilica through a sculpture of golden clouds and angels. Bernini designed this to look like a window into Heaven. There was a great celebration when the chair was put in place on January 16, 1666. 
To the west of the basilica is the "Piazza di San Pietro" (St. Peter's Place). The piazza was designed by Bernini and built between 1656 and 1667. It was not an easy job because the designer had lots of things to think about. Firstly, many people complained that Maderna's "facade" on St. Peter's looked too wide, so Bernini wanted to make it look narrower, not wider. Secondly, in the old square left over from the Old St. Peter's, Pope Sixtus V had a monument set up. This monument was a precious Ancient Egyptian "obelisk" (which is like a tall column, but with four flat sides). From its base to the top of the cross (that the pope had put on top) it was 40 metres (131 ft) high, and had been brought to Roman in ancient times. The obelisk really should be at the centre of the new square, but it was not in quite the right place, and was very difficult to move without breaking. The third problem was that Maderna had built a fountain to one side of the obelisk, and Bernini needed to make another fountain to match it, otherwise the design would look unbalanced. 

Bernini solved the problem by making two areas, instead of one huge one. The first area is an almost-square area right in front of the facade. It is cleverly designed with sloping sides that make the building look taller and not so wide. The second part of the piazza is oval. It has the obelisk at the centre with two fountains on either side at the widest part. The two parts of the piazza are surrounded by a "colonnade" (covered walk-way) which is carried on tall columns. All around are large statues of saints which seem to look down on the thousands of visitors that come to the square every day. The colonnade is in two great arcs that seem to stretch out like loving arms, welcoming people to the Basilica. In recent times some buildings were demolished, making another square, to match the one near the piazza. It is a good place for vans to park and can be seen in the photo.

The famous architectural historian, Sir Banister Fletcher, said that no other city in the world had given such a wonderful view to people visiting their main church. He said that no other architect except Bernini could have imagined such a noble design. He said it is the greatest entrance to the greatest Christian church in the whole world.

Bernini's last work for St. Peter's, 1676, was to decorate of the Chapel of the Sacrament. He designed a miniature temple just like the one that was built over the place where St. Peter died. He made it bronze covered with fine gold. On either side is an angel, one gazing in adoration and the other looking towards the viewer in welcome. Bernini died in 1680 aged 81, after working for St. Peter's for 40 years of his life.

Ellen Axson Wilson

Ellen Louise Axson Wilson (May 15, 1860 - August 6, 1914) was the first wife of Woodrow Wilson. She was First Lady of the United States from 1913 until her death.

Ellen spent her childhood in Rome, Georgia. Her father’s name was Reverend S.E. Axson. Her father was a Presbyterian minister. Thomas Woodrow Wilson first saw Ellen when he was about six and she only a baby. In 1883, as a young lawyer from Atlanta, "Tommy" visited Rome (Georgia) and met "Miss Ellie Lou" again. She was looking after her father’s household. He wanted to marry her. The marriage took place in 1885, as she did not immediately wanted to leave her father alone. 

In the same year, her husband got a teaching job at Bryn Mawr College. They lived near the campus. She kept her younger brother with them. The Wilson couple had three children. Margaret was born in 1886; Jessie was born in 1887. A third child named Eleanor was born in Connecticut, while Wilson was teaching at Wesleyan University. 

Beginning in 1890, her husband had a well-known career at Princeton University. This brought much social responsibility to Ellen. She spent most of her time painting. She had a studio in the White House where she painted. 

The Wilson couple began their administration without any party. As the First Lady, Ellen’s entertainments were also simple. But her and warmness made the people happy. Her parties became successes. 

As the First Lady, Ellen Wilson tried for improving the housing for the "Negroes" living in Washington D.C. She visited the slums where Negro families lived. This brought their bad living condition to the attention of the Congressmen. 

She had Bright's disease. She died on 6 August 1914. At the time of her death, she quietly said to the physician: "…take good care of my husband." She also told her physician to tell her husband to marry again after her death. Wilson was very sad at her death. He took her to Rome (Georgia) for burial. He would later marry Edith Wilson in 1915.

That day, 25 November, is now known as the "International Day of Non Violence Against Women".

The Hermanas Mirabal province has a total area of 440.43 km². It has only 0.9% of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 31st (out of 31 plus the National District) province in size; only the National District is smaller.

There are three municipalities and two municipal districts in the province.

The municipalities and their municipal districts (M.D.) are:

In 2002 (last national census), there were 96,356 people living in the Hermanas Mirabal province, and just 23,126 (24.0%) living in towns and cities. The population density was 219 persons/km², one of the highest in the country.

Bartolomé de Las Casas

Bartolomé de Las Casas (1484 – 1566), known as the "Apostle of the Indies", was a 16th century Spanish priest and writer, and the first Bishop of Chiapas, Mexico.

Bartolome de Las Casas was born in Seville, Spain in 1484. He was present when Christopher Columbus got to Seville in 1493 after the first voyage to the Americas. His father, Pedro de las Casas, and his uncle went to the Americas in the second voyage of Columbus that left in November 1493.

With his father, he went to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in 1502 together with Nicolás de Ovando, the new governor of the island. In 1506 he went to Rome, Italy, where he became a Catholic priest.

He went back to Hispaniola in 1508 and moved to Concepción de la Vega, in the Cibao valley, and got an encomienda (land with the indigenous people living there). Then he went in 1513 to Cuba and the governor Diego Velázquez gave him an "encomienda". But soon Las Casas began to understand that the native people (Taínos in Cuba and Hispaniola) were treated as slaves in a very bad way, and he began to defend the native people.

In 1515 he went to Hispaniola, and from there to Spain to defend the native people of the Americas. From 1517 to 1523, and with the title "Protector of the Indians", he tried to develop a model settlement in northern Venezuela to protect the native people but the experiment failed. From there, he went to Hispaniola, joining the Dominican Order (an order of Catholic priests) in 1523.

He stayed in the city of Santo Domingo until 1527 when he was sent to Puerto Plata, on the northern coast, to found a new religious community and where he began to write his "History of the Indies".

He became Bishop of Chiapas, Mexico, from 1544 to 1547. He went to Spain and he stayed here until he died in 17 July 1566 in Madrid.

Some of his more important written works are:

Martin van Heemskerck

Marten Jacobszoon Heemskerck van Veen or "Maarten van Heemskerck" (1498, Heemskerck – 1 October 1574, Haarlem), was one of the best known Dutch portrait and religious painters of the 16th century (1500s). He became famous for a series of coloured prints of the Seven Wonders of the World. 

Marten van Heemskerck was born in the town of Heemskerck, near Haarlem in Holland. His father was a farmer. Marten was apprenticed to two painters in Haarlem, but was called home by his father to help with the farm work. Marten ran away from home, and in a single day travelled 50 miles to the town of Delft. He found another master to teach him painting, but soon left him as well. He then went to Haarlem where from 1527-29 he worked with a painter called Jan van Scorel. 

One of the artists who influenced Marten van Heemskerck at this time was Jan Mabuse who had travelled to Italy and had seen the paintings of famous artists from Florence and Venice. Marten began to copy the style of Mabuse's paintings. In 1532 he went to Italy and spent several years going from town to town, looking at the artworks and making drawings of what he saw. 

The city that was to have the most influence on Marten van Heemskerck was Rome. He was very interested in the ruins left from the time of the Ancient Romans. He made many drawings of the ruined buildings and other things that he saw. His sketchbooks, which are now in a museum in Berlin are very important evidence for showing what Rome was like in the 1500s. One important building that he drew was St. Peter's Basilica which had been begun, but never completed. 

The most famous artist who was alive at this time was Michelangelo. He was mainly a sculptor but he had spent five years painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Like everybody else, Marten van Heemskerck thought it was amazing. He was so influenced by the figures that Michelangelo had painted that he designed a series of pictures called "Twelve Panels showing Strong Men from Mythology and Biblical History". Like the series of the "Seven Wonders of the Ancient World" they are well known as prints made from "engravings" (they are printed from a metal plate with the design cut into it). 
When van Heemskerck was in Rome in 1536, he got work as a "scene-painter". This is like a person who paints the scenery in a theatre. Charles V had coming to Rome and was going to have a "triumphal procession". The streets of the city were decorated with archways for the emperor to pass under. Van Heemskerck worked with Antonio da San Gallo, Battista Franco and Francesco Salviati. The writer Giorgio Vasari saw some battle scenes that he painted and wrote that they were well composed and boldly painted.

He returned to the Netherlands and lived at Haarlem where he settled down and married twice. After that, he only left Haarlem for a short time, in 1572, to go to Amsterdam because the Spanish had invaded Haarlem. In 1540 became president of his Guild of Painters. He became a wealthy and well-known painter. When he died, he left some money in his will to be paid to a bridal couple who would get married on his tomb. This custom was believed to bring peace to the dead person. He also left some land to help an orphanage in the city. 

Many works by Marten van Heemskerck can still be seen. They include "Adam and Eve", "St. Luke painting the Madonna and Child" and a painting of Jesus in the museum in Ghent, Belgium. These pictures were done before he went to Italy. In the 1550's he painted several altarpieces which can be seen in the museums of Delft, Haarlem and Brussels, as well as lives of St. Bernard and St. Benedict.

Currywurst

Currywurst is a German dish. It is a hot pork sausage (), sliced and covered in a "curry sauce" (usually ketchup or tomato paste blended with curry) and generous amounts of curry powder. 

Currywurst is often sold as a take-out/take-away food, Schnell-Imbisse, at diners or "greasy spoons," on children's menus in restaurants, or as a street food.

Berlin legend says that Herta Heuwer, from Königsberg, invented the currywurst sauce by experimenting at her stall in Berlin-Charlottenburg in 1949.
People from the Ruhr-area say that the sauce was accidentally invented by a sausage stall owner in Essen, who dropped a can with curry powder into some ketchup. 

Early in his career German pop singer Herbert Grönemeyer, raised in Bochum, wrote a song, in the Ruhr dialect, to currywurst.

Although Berlin claims currywurst as its invention and "national dish", all over Germany, there are more than 20 different types of currywurst.

Johann Palisa (December 6 1848–May 2 1925) was an Austrian astronomer, born in Troppau in Austrian Silesia (now in the Czech Republic).

He was a good finder of asteroids, finding 122 in all, from 136 Austria in 1874 to 1073 Gellivara in 1923. Some of the notable asteroids he found include 153 Hilda, 216 Kleopatra, 243 Ida, 253 Mathilde, 324 Bamberga, and the Amor asteroid 719 Albert.

The asteroid 914 Palisana and the Palisa crater on the Moon were named in his honour.

From 1866 to 1870, Palisa studied mathematics and astronomy at the University of Vienna; however, he did not graduate until 1884. Despite this, by 1870 he was an assistant at the University's observatory, and a year later gained a position at the observatory in Geneva. A few years later, in 1872, at the age of 24, Palisa became the leader of the Austrian Naval Observatory in Pola. While at Pola, he found his first asteroid, 136 Austria, on March 18, 1874. Along with this, he found twenty-seven minor planets and one comet. During his stay in Pola he used a small six-inch refractor telescope to aid in his research.

Nuclear power plant

A nuclear power plant is a place where people make electricity using heat from nuclear reactions. A nuclear power plant has a place where the nuclear reaction happens called a reactor. The plant also has machines which remove heat from the reactor and make electricity. Electricity made by nuclear power plants is called nuclear power. 

Nuclear power plants are usually located near water to remove the heat the reactor makes. Some nuclear power plants use cooling towers to do this.
Nuclear power plants use uranium as fuel. When the reactor is on, uranium atoms inside the reactor split into two smaller atoms. When uranium atoms split, they give off a large amount of heat. This splitting of atoms is called fission. 

The most popular atoms to fission are uranium and plutonium. Uranium atoms are slightly radioactive. The atoms produced when uranium breaks apart are strongly radioactive. Today, fission only happens in nuclear reactors. In nuclear reactors, fission only happens when the reactors parts are arranged properly. Nuclear power plants turn their reactors off to replace old fuel with new fuel. 

There are about four hundred nuclear power plants in the world, with many in the United States, France, and Japan. Some famous accidents at nuclear power plants were the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine, and the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the United States.

American Airlines Flight 11

American Airlines Flight 11 was the first hijacked airplane of the September 11, 2001 attacks. It crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. The American Airlines airplane was a Boeing 767. It was scheduled to fly from Logan International Airport in Boston to Los Angeles International Airport. Fifteen minutes after takeoff, the hijackers forced their way into the cockpit. One of the hijackers was a trained pilot. He took the controls of the aircraft and flew it into the North Tower. 

All 92 people on the airplane died in the crash—11 crew members and 81 passengers; 5 of them were hijackers. The time of the crash was 08:46 Eastern Daylight Time. Many people in the street saw the crash. It was also recorded on movie by French moviemakers. The crash, and the fire that started right after the crash, made the North Tower collapse. The attack killed and hurt thousands of people.

The American Airlines Flight 11 aircraft was a Boeing 767. Even though it could carry 158 passengers, the September 11 flight carried only 81 passengers and 11 crew members. Flying the aircraft was pilot John Ogonowski and first officer Thomas McGuinness. The flight attendants were Barbara Arestegui, Jeffrey Collman, Sara Low, Karen Martin, Kathleen Nicosia, Betty Ong, Jean Roger, Dianne Snyder and Madeline Sweeney.

Mohamed Atta, a member of terrorist organization al-Qaeda and leader of the attacks, and another hijacker, Abdulaziz al-Omari, flew together from Portland, Maine to Boston early on September 11, 2001. Both hijackers had first class tickets for a flight to Los Angeles, California. Three other hijackers, Waleed al-Shehri, Wail al-Shehri and Satam al-Suqami arrived at Logan International Airport by car. All five checked in and by 07:40, were aboard the aircraft which was supposed to leave at 07:45. 

Mohamed Atta sat in business class with Abdulaziz al-Omari and Suqami. Waleed al-Shehri and Wail al-Shehri sat in first class. The aircraft taxied away from Gate 26 and departed Logan International Airport at 07:59 from runway 4R after a 14-minute delay.

It is thought that the highjacking of the plane started at 08:14. This was when the pilot and first officer stopped talking with air traffic control at Boston. Two minutes later, the aircraft stopped flying along the route it was supposed to. No more radio replies came from the aircraft and the system in the aircraft used to avoid collisions with other aircraft was also switched off. Flight attendants Ong and Sweeney contacted American Airlines with AT&T airphones during the hijack. They said the hijackers had hurt two of the other attendants and killed an Israeli passenger. During the long four-minute call, Ong told the airline which seats the hijackers were sitting in and said no-one could get into the cockpit.

At 08:23:38, Atta tried to talk to the passengers from the cockpit but he pressed the wrong button and sent the message to air traffic control. He said that "[They] have some planes, just stay quiet and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport." A minute later he said, "Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet." Air traffic control realized the aircraft had been hijacked and they called the Federal Aviation Administration. Soon after, Atta announced "Nobody move please, we are going back to the airport, don't try to make any stupid moves." Five minutes later Boston Air Traffic Control called North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). NORAD ordered two F-15 fighter aircraft to catch the flight, but it was too late—AA 11 had already made its last turn towards Manhattan and crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center more than six minutes before the fighter aircraft had taken off.

At 08:46:40, the hijackers crashed Flight 11 into the northern side of the North Tower (Tower 1) of the World Trade Center. The aircraft, traveling at about and carrying about 10,000 U.S. gallons of flammable fuel, hit between the 93rd and 99th floors of the North Tower. In all, 92 people on board were killed.

Because the North Tower was so damaged, people could not escape from above where the aircraft had crashed. All stairs and elevators from the 92nd floor and up were blocked, trapping 1,344 people. Hundreds were killed right away by the impact. The rest either were trapped and died from the fire and smoke or the collapse of the tower. Some died after they jumped from the building. More than one elevator shaft carried burning fuel downward, exploding on the way down.

Jules Naudet, a French cameraman filmed the crash. A webcam set up at an art in Brooklyn to take pictures of Lower Manhattan every four seconds also filmed Flight 11 crashing into the North Tower.

News organizations first reported an explosion at the World Trade Center. CNN interrupted a commercial at 08:49 with the headline that read "World Trade Center Disaster." President George W. Bush was arriving at an elementary school in Sarasota, Florida when he was told about the crash. The president said, "This is pilot error. It's unbelievable that somebody would do this. The guy must have had a heart attack." The first news reports believed that the crash had been an accident until Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower at 09:03.

After the crash, the North Tower burned and collapsed. Although the crash caused much damage, the fire caused by jet fuel was blamed for the damage and collapse of the tower. Hundreds of rescue workers also died when the tower collapsed. 

Rescue workers at the site started to find remains of bodies from the victims of Flight 11 soon after the attack. Some workers found bodies strapped to airplane seats. Other workers discovered the body of a flight attendant with her hands tied up. That meant that the hijackers may have used handcuffs. Within a year, remains of the 33 victims that had been on Flight 11 had been identified. They identified two other Flight 11 victims, lead flight attendant Karen Martin and another person, after body remains were discovered near Ground Zero in 2006. In April 2007, examiners using newer DNA technology identified another Flight 11 victim. The remains of two hijackers, who could have been from Flight 11, were also identified and removed from Memorial Park in Manhattan. The remains of the other hijackers have not been identified and are buried with other unidentified remains at Memorial Park.
In a video recording found months later in Afghanistan, al-Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, seemed to say he planned the attack. He said he believed part of towers would collapse. The flight recorders, or tapes that record useful flight data, for Flight 11 and Flight 175 were never found.

After the attacks, the flight number for flights on the same route at the same takeoff time was changed to American Airlines Flight 25, and a Boeing 757 was used instead of a Boeing 767. An American flag was flown on the jet bridge from which Flight 11 departed from Logan Airport.

John Bonham

John Henry "Bonzo" Bonham (May 31 1948 – September 25, 1980) was an English rock drummer. He was best known for being a member of London hard rock band Led Zeppelin. 
John Bonham's career started when he joined the Band of Joy in 1967 with singer Robert Plant. After enjoying some small success, the band broke up. At around the same time, another band called The Yardbirds also broke up. Soon after this, Jimmy Page, the lead guitarist for the Yardbirds, decided to start a new band. This new band, called Led Zeppelin, had Plant on vocals, John Paul Jones on bass and keyboards, Bonham on drums and Page playing guitar.
Soon after playing some small gigs throughout England, the band came out with their first album, named "Led Zeppelin I." John Bonham's talents can be heard on such songs as "Good Times, Bad Times", featuring his single bass drum skip throughout the song. Soon after this the band left for a tour of America on Boxing Day(Dec. 26 1969). After a somewhat successful tour, Zeppelin came out with their second album, naming it "Led Zeppelin II." This album included the song "Moby Dick", which had a famous drum solo by Bonham. Throughout the solo, Bonham showed off his talents by playing hand drums while continuing to use his right foot.
By this time Led Zeppelin was beginning to become more and more well known and with the release of their third album (which was a surprise because it was named "Led Zeppelin III") they had become one of the biggest bands in the world. Bonham's featured song on this album, which he wrote, was "Out On The Tiles". 

Led Zeppelin went on to release albums such as "Led Zeppelin IV" (which was originally un-named), "Houses of the Holy", and "Physical Graffiti". During this time, Zeppelin was touring non-stop and Bonham was amazing audiences around the world with Moby Dick. He also received attention for his work on songs such as "Four Sticks", "The Ocean", and "In My Time Of Dying". 

Soon after "Physical Graffiti", the band took time off because of a car crash involving Robert Plant. In this time off, besides spending time with his family and tinkering with cars, Bonham worked on their next album, "Presence".

On 25 September 1980, Bonham was picked up by the manager of Led Zeppelin, Rex King. They were going to a rehearsal for the upcoming tour. During the day, Bonham drank many alchoholic beverages. After the rehersal the band left and went to Jimmy Page's house. Benji LeFevre, Led Zeppelins new tour manager, and John Paul Jones found him dead the next day.

The coroner found that Bonham had drunk forty measures of Vodka, and his cause of death was Pulmonary edema. Bonham had vomited in his sleep, and suffocated on his own vomit.

After Bonham died, Led Zeppelin decided to quit because they felt that Bonham was too good to be replaced.

Quack

Quack is the sound a duck makes.

Quack is also the name for someone who is a phony. One way that people use this word is a "quack doctor". A quack doctor sells people bad medicine that does not make people feel better.

A quack can also mean a fake doctor who tries to sell his medicine to people when they do not really make you better which means they are fake. A quack doctor tries to tell people that they can cure everything but they can not, they just con you into going to them, but they do not cure you, they just make you feel a little bit better. 
They also take some of the jobs from the doctors who have been to university and studied to become a doctor and then Quacks are just taking their patients away from them.

A reference to the word "quack" was made on television series "QI" for being proven to be funnier than other farm yard animal noises. Due to the way the word is pronounced it naturally forces people to smile enticing others to smile or even laugh.

Ozama River

The River Ozama is a river in the eastern part of the "Llano Costero del Caribe" (in English, "Caribbean Coastal Plain"). Its overall length of 148 km makes it the fourth longest river in the Dominican Republic, and its watershed (2,685 km²) is the fourth largest of the country.

Because large parts of the watershed is found in region where rainfalls are frequent, without a dry period, its flow is always very good.

Ozama is a Taíno word. Bartolomé de Las Casas always wrote "Hozama". When he wrote, the "H" represented the letter "J" and was pronounced (similar to the English "H" in house, home). There are several words in the Dominican Republic with that H: Haina-Jaina, Haití-Jaití.

Writers of the 16th century wrote Hosama and Osama. But later the H disappeared completely.

The sources of the Ozama are in the Loma Siete Cabezas mountain (in English, "Seven Heads Mountain"), the highest mountain of the Sierra de Yamasá mountain range. It flows east through the Monte Plata province and then slowly bends southeast, forming part of the limits between the Santo Domingo and Monte Plata provinces.

Near the municipality of San Luis, it is joined by the River Yabacao and then turns to the southwest. In the city of Santo Domingo, the river flows to the south and into the Caribbean Sea.

The most important tributaries are Yabacao, Isabela and Savita (or Sabita).

The "Greater Santo Domingo", that includes Santo Domingo and parts of Santo Domingo Este and Santo Domingo Norte, is the most important city on the river banks. The river divides the old city of Santo Domingo in three sections; before 2001, all three sections were part of Santo Domingo but now only the western part is part of the city. The eastern section is the city of Santo Domingo Este and the northern section is part of Santo Domingo Norte.

The River Ozama flows through a region where rainfalls are frequent and, for that reason, its water is not needed for irrigation. There are too much solid materials in the water and it cannot be used for the houses.

Water from the Caribbean Sea gets into the river for several kilometres because the riverbed is below sea level. There were mangroves (plants that can live in water with a hight salinity), and there are still some near La Victoria, on the banks of the river near the mouth because of the salinity of its water.

Water quality in the River Ozama has been severely affected by industrialisation, ships, and the large population that lives around its banks close to the mouth.

The river is not deep enough for big ships except close to the mouth. When the country was a Spanish colony, and some years after the Independence, flat boats were used to move around the region.

The city of Santo Domingo was founded in the 16th century on the left side of the mouth but soon it was moved to the right side and became the capital city of the Spanish colony.

Sugarcane was grown to produce sugar in lands around the River Ozama and its tributary Isabela. The river was used to take the sugar to the port of Santo Domingo.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, sugar cane was the most important crop grown close to the River Ozama. Cattle is also important in the region because grasses are abundant.

For the second half of the 20th century, Santo Domingo became the most important port of the country; the port was near the mouth of the River Ozama. But now the port is used mainly for tourist ships.

The River Ozama has been used in art, mainly in poetry, as a symbol of the country. Many poets wrote poems about the river when they were out of the country because of political reasons; they sang to the river to represent the return to their country. José Joaquín Puello, a Dominican poet of the 19th century, wrote several poems where the name is used to represent the country; two of them are "Ecos del destierro" ("Distant sounds from the exile") and "La vuelta al hogar" ("Back to home").

American Airlines Flight 77

American Airlines Flight 77 was American Airlines' transcontinental flight from Washington Dulles International Airport, in Dulles, Virginia to Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California. The flight flew every day in the morning on this route. On September 11, 2001, the aircraft flying this route—a Boeing 757-223—was hijacked by five al-Qaeda terrorists. The hijackers crashed the plane into the Pentagon on purpose. The crash was part of the September 11 attacks.

The hijackers went into the cockpit and made the passengers move to the back of the plane less than 35 minutes into the flight. Hani Hanjour, one of the hijackers who was trained as a pilot, took over the flight. Passengers on the plane were able to make telephone calls to loved ones. They also called people to tell them what was happening on the plane. The hijackers did not know that passengers were doing this.

The aircraft crashed into the western side of the Pentagon at 09:37 EDT. All 64 people on board the aircraft, including the hijackers, died. 125 people in the building died as well. Dozens of people saw the crash. News sources began reporting on the incident within minutes. The impact damaged an area of the Pentagon and started a large fire. Part of the Pentagon collapsed. Firefighters spent days trying to stop the fire. The damaged areas of the Pentagon were rebuilt in 2002. The fixed areas on August 15, 2002 were able to be used again starting on August 15, 2002.

The 184 victims of the attack are honored in the Pentagon Memorial next to the Pentagon. The park contains a bench for each of the victims. The benches are put in order of the victim's years of birth. These years range from 1930 (aged 71) to 1998 (aged 3).

Emmanuel College, Melbourne

The Emmanuel College: St. Paul's Campus (formerly St. Paul's College) is a Roman Catholic, secondary day school for boys, located in Altona North, a south-western suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It a branch of one of Emmanuel College's education facilities.

St. Paul's Campus started as 'St. Paul's College' in 1965, under the guidance of the American Order of the Society of Marianists. The order had been asked to start this Catholic Secondary Boys' College by the then Archbishop of Melbourne, Dr. Daniel Mannix. The college's colours were then Red, White and Blue and its motto was Ecce Mater Tua (Latin:"Behold Thy Mother").

In the early 1960s, the local parish priests purchased a large, eight hectare, undeveloped block in Altona North. Through the work of the parents of the school's first students, the austere block was transformed into an attractive property. The College's primary edifice, the three-storey building called the "Jubilee Building", was completed in 1969. Following to be completed were:


The Jubilee Building was extensively renovated in 1998. In 2004, with the assistance of a Commonwealth Government grant, work commenced on enlarging the library complex and the building of two new computer labs. These developments were completed in 2005 and the College has not undergone any significant renovations since. 

In 2006, the plans for Emmanuel College and the future of the school initiated. 2008 saw the full change from 'St. Paul's College' to 'Emmanuel College' with the acquisition of a second co-educational campus. The school eventually incorporated a new emblem and changed its motto to Life To The Full, which comes from the Gospel according to John: ""I have come that they may have life and have it to the full"" (John 10:10).

Since 1997, the principal has been Mr. Christopher Stock (BSc DipEd MEd B.Theol) at the St. Paul's Campus. In 2008 when the change to Emmanuel College was complete, he became the principal of Emmanuel College, and thus being the principal of two schools; the St. Paul's Campus and the Notre Dame Campus.

Emmanuel College House System consists of 5 houses:


These houses are named after the Marianists who first served at the school. Each house has eight homerooms, each with about 25 students ranged from years 7-12 per homeroom.

Emmanuel College has offered the VCE program at the St. Paul's Campus since its began in 1990.

Shoulder rest

A shoulder rest is something which is used by people who play the violin or the viola. It may be made of wood, aluminium, carbon fiber or plastic. Usually, the shoulder rest attaches to the edge of the violin with "feet" padded with rubber tubing or made of soft plastic.

The purpose of a shoulder rest is to help the player to be comfortable holding the violin, which is held between the chin and the shoulder. Not all players use a shoulder rest. Many violinists prefer just to put a piece of cloth or some other form of padding on their shoulder. Whether a player uses a shoulder rest may depend on whether he or she has a long neck, and whether he is wearing clothes made with thick or thin material. It is important that the player can shift his left hand easily and freely to play in the higher positions without being afraid that he will drop the instrument, and without feeling the need to squeeze the instrument between his chin and shoulder as this will make the muscles in his neck very tight.

The shoulder rest must not be confused with the chinrest, which is the bit on which the player rests his chin.

Certain category groups have special uses or requirements.

Categories that are based on geography and nationality (for example, , and ) all use the same basic structure. Nationality categories are sub-categories of their associated geography categories ( is a sub-category of ) as well as what ever other categories apply ( is also a based category so it is a sub-category of 

The top level of each category is based on the continent it is a part of. The next level would be Country. Each country is seperatd into the major sub-division of that country (states, regions and provinces) and then smaller subdivisions (counties). This is repeated down until the municipality level (city, town) is reached. 

Categories are only seperated down to the point there is enough articles to need it. The municipality level is usually only needed for the largest of cities. In some cases, steps between categories can be skipped. For example, in most countries, the city category is a part of the country category because there is not enough need for the steps in between. 

A sample of commonly seen country sub-divisions is seen below. 



The United Kingdom is a special case. It includes the countries of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well as many other areas. Many of these areas do not have their own categories. Another problem is that if something is termed "British" (from the United Kingdom), it may not be possible to know if it is actually one of the countries which make up the United Kingdom. If the actual country is known, it should be used. If it is not known, the British/United Kingdom level should be used. 

The is used to group all entertainers who deal with music.

The main category includes sub-categories for singers, songwriters, musicians, bands, composers and conductors. The category is broken down into each of these major groups as well as .

The secondary levels (the sub-categories) are mainly broken down into a combination of nationality and occupation. Examples of this are and . The categories use the same basic set-up for nationality as the Geography categories.

Many topics have types of categories which usually apply to every article in the topic. For example, Movies should all have a category for the year they were released, the genre(s) of the movie, and its country of origin.

<doc id="97830" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97830" title="Camera obscura">
Camera obscura

The camera obscura (Lat. "dark chamber") was an optical device that helped the invention of photography. In English, today's photographic devices are still known as "cameras".

The principle of the camera obscura can be demonstrated with a rudimentary type, just a box (which may be room-size) with a hole in one side, (see pinhole camera for construction details). Light from only one part of a scene will pass through the hole and strike a specific part of the back wall. (The projection can be made on paper on which an artist can copy the image.) 

With this simple do-it-yourself apparatus, the image is always upside-down. By using mirrors, as in the 18th century overhead version, it is also possible to project an up-side-up image. 
As a pinhole is made smaller, the image gets sharper, but the light-sensitivity decreases. 

The first mention and discovery of the principles behind the pinhole camera, a precursor to the camera obscura, belong to Mozi (470 BC to 390 BC), a Chinese philosopher and founder of Mohism. Later, Aristotle (384 to 322 BC) understood the optical principle of the pinhole camera. He viewed the crescent shape of a partially eclipsed sun projected on the ground through the holes in a sieve, and the gaps between leaves of a plane tree.

The first camera obscura was later built by an Iraqi scientist named Abu Ali Al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham, born in Basra (965-1039 AD), known in the West as "Alhacen" or "Alhazen", who carried out practical experiments on optics in his "Book of Optics". In his various experiments, Ibn Al-Haitham used the term “"Al-Bayt al-Muthlim"”(Arabic: البيت المظلم), translated in English as dark room. In the experiment he undertook, in order to establish that light travels in time and with speed, he says: “If "the hole was covered with a curtain and the curtain was taken off, the light traveling from the hole to the opposite wall will consume time.”" He reiterated the same experience when he established that light travels in straight lines. The most revealing experiment which indeed introduced the camera obscura was in his studies of the half-moon shape of the sun’s image during eclipses which he observed on the wall opposite a small hole made in the window shutters. In his famous essay "On the form of the Eclipse" ("Maqalah-fi-Surat-al-Kosuf") (Arabic: مقالة في صورةالكسوف) he commented on his observation "The "image of the sun at the time of the eclipse, unless it is total, demonstrates that when its light passes through a narrow, round hole and is cast on a plane opposite to the hole it takes on the form of a moon-sickle"”. 

In his experiment of the sun light he extended his observation of the penetration of light through the pinhole to conclude that when the sun light reaches and penetrates the hole it makes a conic shape at the points meeting at the pinhole, forming later another conic shape reverse to the first one on the opposite wall in the dark room. This happens when sun light diverges from point “ﺍ” until it reaches an aperture “ﺏﺤ” and is projected through it onto a screen at the luminous spot “ﺩﻫ”. Since the distance between the aperture and the screen is insignificant in comparison to the distance between the aperture and the sun, the divergence of sunlight after going through the aperture should be insignificant. In other words, “ﺏﺤ” should be about equal to “ﺩﻫ”. However, it is observed to be much greater “ﻙﻁ” when the paths of the rays which form the extremities of “ﻙﻁ” are retraced in the reverse direction, it is found that they meet at a point outside the aperture and then diverge again toward the sun as illustrated in figure 1. This was indeed the first accurate description of the Camera Obscura phenomenon. 
In camera terms, the light converges into the room through the hole transmitting with it the object(s) facing it. The object will appear in full colour but upside down on the projecting screen/wall opposite the hole inside the dark room. The explanation is that light travels in a straight line and when some of the rays reflected from a bright subject pass through the small hole in thin material they do not scatter but cross and reform as an upside down image on a flat white surface held parallel to the hole. Ib Al-Haitham established that the smaller the hole is, the clearer the picture is.

Although both the pinhole camera and camera obscura is credited to Ibn al-Haytham, the camera obscura was first described by Aristotle, who was the first to describe how an image is formed on the eye, using the camera obscura as an analogy. Alhazen states (in the Latin translation), and with respect to the camera obscura, "Et nos non inventimus ita", we did not invent this.

Some camera obscura have been built as tourist attractions, often taking the form of a large chamber within a high building that can be darkened so that a 'live' panorama of the world outside is projected onto a horizontal surface through a rotating lens. Although few now survive, examples can be found at the following locations:
There is also a portable example which Willett & Patteson tour around England and the world.

<doc id="97834" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97834" title="Pinhole camera">
Pinhole camera

A pinhole camera is a camera without a conventional glass lens. An extremely small hole in a very thin material can focus light when all rays from a scene go through a single point. In order to produce a reasonably clear image, the aperture has to be about 1/100th the distance to the screen, or less. The shutter of a pinhole camera usually consists of a hand operated flap of some light-proof material to cover and uncover the pinhole. 

A common use of a pinhole camera is to capture the movement of sunlight over a long period of time. This type of photography is called Solargraphy. 
Pinhole cameras require much longer exposure times than conventional cameras because of the small aperture; typical exposure times can range from 5 seconds to hours or days. 

The image may be projected on a translucent screen for real-time viewing (popular for viewing solar eclipses; see also camera obscura). 

Very early in history (as far back as 500 B.C.), Greeks such as Aristotle and Euclid wrote on naturally-occurring rudimentary pinhole cameras, for example light may travel through the slits of wicker baskets and the crossing of leaves The ancient Greeks, however, believed that our eye emitted rays which enabled us to see. What enabled a much better understanding of the pinhole camera was the discovery that light enters the eye rather than leaving it. It was the 10th-century Muslim mathematician, astronomer and physicist Ibn al-Haytham who published this idea.

In photography a shutter is the part of a camera that opens for a controlled period of time to let light in during taking a picture.

A shutter can also be used to allow pulses of light to pass outwards, as in a movie projector or signal lamp.

Camera shutters can be fitted in two positions:

Shutters immediately behind the lens were used in some cameras with limited lens interchangeability. Shutters in front of the lens were used in the early days of photography.

Red link lists that aren't likely to be populated by blue links any time soon. Also debated putting up List of palaces in Bangkok as it's also only redlinks but that would at least contain useful information if populated. · 17:44, 16 April 2008 (UTC)

Delete as no one cares about these things except people who live near or there.--  †   03:14, 17 April 2008 (UTC)

Delete I thought about it, but their just red links, not useful. 04:04, 17 April 2008 (UTC)

Delete per above.     07:05, 17 April 2008 (UTC)

Result: Delete.     12:07, 22 April 2008 (UTC)

Unneded, there's not really a neeed for all these templates. 00:47, 12 April 2008 (UTC)


Result: Keep - not enough consensus.     12:09, 21 April 2008 (UTC)

This does not appear notable. Only got 65 hits on Google. I believe that makes this clearly fail Notability as I have already stated.   †   04:54, 14 April 2008 (UTC)

This term seems to exist only on the Web site linked. That is, it is self-published spam. () 15:22, 9 April 2008 (UTC)

Notability. Never heard of this and I am pretty sure that this would fail en:WP's BOLP policy. Google search only got 583 hits. 14:15, 10 April 2008 (UTC)

It is very difficult to see if this is notable; The original seems to be based on Society of St.John the Evangelist. I don´t know how I came to the idea to classify it as an Anglican religious order (the only one so far). There also seem to be the Antiochian Orthodox Church (in America) which has a "Fellowship of St. John the Divine" and the "Orthodox Fellowship of St. John the Baptist", which looks like an Orthodox version of the in the United Kingdom. For this reason, I think we should consider its deletion, as a regular request; If we don't delete it, we need to clarify, and probably add pages for the other two organisations listed.


This article seems to be advertising about the country as it consists of only one recipe and does not talk about Costa Rican food in general. ( ▪ ) 11:56, 5 April 2008 (UTC)

No notability. This Google search confirms this. Even though it has it's own website, it doesn't have it's own English Wikipedia page, and I don't think that it fits the bill for notability. 15:14, 31 March 2008 (UTC)


So far, 4 episode pages have been written (1, 2, 3, 4). I can't imagine that we need a page on every episode when a short description on the List of SpongeBob SquarePants episodes would probably be sufficient. English Wikipedia doesn't even have pages for each episode, they have a medium-length blurb on each episode but have pages for the episodes in each season (). I think this would be a preferable format for here as well. The pages themselves don't add much in the way of content (the pictures don't work properly and the trivia sections shouldn't even be there as they are inappropriate for an encyclopedia). A page on each 10 minute episode not only seems silly, but would also produce a navbox that's twice as long as the (which is already ridiculously long). I propose re-formatting to something similar to the formatting at en:wiki. · 16:18, 28 March 2008 (UTC)


Not notable. Google search gives 6 hits about the short film (not "series"). · 15:39, 28 March 2008 (UTC)

It appears to be a propaganda, which shouldn't be here. ( ▪ ) 11:29, 29 March 2008 (UTC)

Unneeded in its current state, gives little information and is not a 'list' at all. () 11:56, 23 March 2008 (UTC)

No hint of notability. This search on Google confirms my own suspicions as it only lists 2 pages; us for both of the pages. 19:52, 18 March 2008 (UTC)

No notability. this Google search got only 25 hits. This also falls under the category of African non-notable people that we got deleted earlier. 16:05, 17 March 2008 (UTC)

Information given in the article is hard to be verified; also give the birth year of the candidate Doctor (1981), I doubt this doctorate is real. -- () 12:19, 16 March 2008 (UTC)

QD'd. This is the third incarnation of this article. The others were CV's (Spam) -- 22:58, 16 March 2008 (UTC)

No real useful content. Created by an IP registered to UPS. - 09:56, 26 March 2008 (UTC)


. An entry already exists at Simple English Wiktionary.-- 23:49, 4 March 2008 (UTC)
As with the deletion of the the original Esperanza, it's an unnecessary, useless project that's most inactive. Also, with its hierarchy of leaders and members, the project lacks the open and transparent spirit of a wiki. Barnstars, on the other hand, should be split off as a separate project.-- 23:05, 26 February 2008 (UTC)

Cites no sources, and does not establish notability. Snack food ad, anyone? 16:20, 5 March 2008 (UTC)

All had a minor role in a regional leigslature in the 1950s. Not notable. At one point the creator blanked some of these items for deletion, but was reverted because another editor had contributed grammar, etc, fixes. -- 21:09, 10 March 2008 (UTC)

This template isn't needed because of the fact that it has been superceded by the interwiki function. I can see no reason why this template should be needed on this site anymore, as it doesn't look to be very used. 21:00, 8 March 2008 (UTC)
Result: delete 01:37, 13 March 2008 (UTC)

This has no claim to notability. The Google search given here has only 6 results, 2 of which are our pages on this topic. No claims of notability, and no English Wikipedia page of this name. 15:38, 10 March 2008 (UTC)
Result: delete 19:23, 15 March 2008 (UTC)

Unneeded template as per 2 reasons. Reason 1: We don't have any articles that are 100,000kbs or more in length (besides that one list), and reason 2: Mediawiki already warns us of a long page when you edit it. Redundant and unneeded. 20:09, 12 March 2008 (UTC)
