John Wayne Gacy

John Wayne Gacy (March 17, 1942 May 10, 1994), also known as The Killer Clown, was an American serial killer. He is confirmed to have killed 33 young men and boys. He would often kill them in a brutal way and bury their bodies in or near his Chicago home. 

Gacy became known as the "Killer Clown" because he would dress as a clown for fundraising events and parades. In March 1980, Gacy was convicted of 33 sex-related murders, committed between 1972 and 1978, and given the death penalty. He was executed by lethal injection on May 10th, 1994.

John Wayne Gacy, Jr. was born on March 17, 1942, in Chicago, Illinois, to father John Stanley Gacy and mother Marion Elaine Gacy. Gacy's father was a World War I veteran and a machinist, while his mother worked at home. He had two sisters, one younger and one older.

Gacy's father was an alcoholic. Growing up, John Gacy, Sr. would verbally and physically abuse his children. Gacy also had health problems in his youth. For example, in 1953, while playing on a swing set, Gacy hit his head off a swing and suffered a blood clot. The clot was not treated until he was 16.

After dropping out of high school in his senior year, Gacy moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, to work in a mortuary. Three months later, Gacy returned to Chicago, where he enrolled in and graduated from Northwestern Business College. After graduating, Gacy worked as a shoe salesman for the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company. In 1964, Gacy was transferred to Springfield, Illinois, where he met his future wife, Marlynn Myers. They were married in September 1964.

In Springfield, Gacy was involved in community organizations such as the United States Junior Chamber. He became the vice-president of the Springfield chapter by 1965.

After Gacy's father made him an offer to manage three KFC restaurants, Gacy and his wife moved to Waterloo, Iowa, where they had two children.

Aikido

Aikido is performed by blending with the way the attacker moves, using the force of the attack rather than coming against it. This takes very little physical strength, as the "aikidōka" (person who does aikido) uses the force of the attacker's own momentum using stepping and turning movements. The techniques are completed with many different throws or joint locks which can be combined with different defenses. Aikido is one of many grappling arts.

Aikido is based on the martial art of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but began to separate from it in the late 1920s, partly due to Ueshiba's involvement with the Ōmoto-kyō religion. Ueshiba's early students' records use the name "aiki-jūjutsu". Many of Ueshiba's senior students have different approaches to aikido, depending on when they studied with him. Today aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with different groups placing importance on different things. However, they all share techniques learned from Ueshiba and most have concern for the safety of the attacker.

Blog

Blog is another word for weblog. A weblog is a website that is like a diary or journal. Most people can create a blog and then write on that blog. Bloggers (a word for people who write on blogs) often write about their opinions and thoughts.

When a person writes on a blog, what they write is in the form of a "post", which is a single piece of writing on the blog. Posts often include links to other websites.

Blogs can have one or more writers. If they have more than one writer, they are often called community blogs, team blogs, or group blogs.

On many blogs, the person reading the posts can leave comments, which are notes in which a person says what they think about the blog post. This makes blogs good for discussion — if someone writes something that someone else does not believe to be true, someone else can fix it by writing a comment on that blog or on their own blog. Someone else cannot change what the post says, but the writer of the post can. Not all blog posts need to be talked about or fixed. But if there are a lot of people interested in a topic, they can start a discussion on the original blog, on their own blogs, or both. These people can discuss a topic or their point of view.

Very often, a community blog or group blog will shrink into a small group of bloggers (writers) who know and trust each other, called a "creative network". That kind of community blog will also have a larger group of people, a "social network", who only read (and maybe comment on) the blog. Some blogs have scoring (ranking) of posts that makes these networks more solid, so that postings that people like the most are shown first or in a way that is easier to find. 

Often people have their own blog and make an RSS feed to it. When blogs have RSS feeds, other programs, called "content aggregators", can put postings from all the blogs that a person likes in one place. Many people find it easier to read all the new posts from blogs they like in one place, through RSS, instead of going to each site one at a time.

Some experts think that community blogs, and some groups of individual (one-person) blogs that talk about similar topics, have a power structure like that inside a political party. These experts think that a clique (a small, exclusive group of people) will control discussions by choosing when someone has "won" an argument, and when a matter is decided. But an advantage of blogs is that even people outside that clique can comment on the original discussion.

Witch doctor

A witch doctor often refers to a healer in undeveloped regions who use traditional and sometimes out of date methods rather than modern medicine or science.

The term witch doctor is generally used with negative terms. It is often used to imply that the healer has little or no experience or ability in medicine.

The Oxford English Dictionary says that the first recorded use of this term is in 1718, in a book by Francis Hutchinson.

The witch doctors in Africa are known as sangomas in Southern Africa. The Oxford English Dictionary states that the first use of the term "witch doctor" to refer to African shamans (i.e. medicine men) was in 1836 in a book by Robert Montgomery Martin (1803?-1868).

Klingons (Klingon: tlhIngan; Pronunciation: /ˈt͡ɬɪŋɑn/) are a warrior race in the fictional Star Trek universe. They were on the show many times in "Star Trek: The Original Series" (TOS) and were in all five spin-off series afterwards, eventually becoming friends of the United Federation of Planets. 

Made by writer Gene Coon, Klingons were introduced in the episode "Errand of Mercy" (1967). They were named for Lieutenant Wilbur Clingan, who served with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry in the Los Angeles Police Department. 

In the first series, the conflict between the Federation and Klingon was supposed to be referring to the then-current Cold War unfriendliness between the United States and the Soviet Union (which is now gone). "" continued to have the Klingon as a group like the army but made the Klingon fighter rules like bushido, military Japanese rules for behavior valuing honor above life.

Even though the nature of his influence, he begins to like his victims, caring for them in a jovial manner close to a loving grandfather; so he is commonly called "Grandfather Nurgle" or "Papa Nurgle". He is also called the "Lord of Decay", "Master of Plague and Pestilence" and "Lord of All". He is shown as a huge, bloated humanoid, with boils and sores, his body completely rotten from disease.

Al-Andalus (Arabic: الأندلس) was the Arabic name given to those parts of the Iberian Peninsula governed by Muslims, or Moors, at various times in the period between 711 and 1492. As a political domain or domains, it was successively a province of the Umayyad Caliphate, the Caliphate of Córdoba (929-1031), and finally the Caliphate of Córdoba's "taifa" (successor) kingdoms. For large parts of its history, particularly under the Caliphate of Córdoba, Andalus was famous for learning and the city of Córdoba became one of the leading cultural and economic centers in both the Mediterranean basin and the Islamic world.

In 1236, the Reconquista (gradual Christian reconquest) under the forces of Ferdinand III of Castile progressed as far as the last remaining Islamic stronghold, Granada. Granada was reduced to a vassal state to Castile for the next 256 years, until January 2, 1492, when Boabdil surrendered complete control of Granada to Ferdinand and Isabella.

Apollo 13

Apollo 13 was the seventh mission of NASA's Project Apollo and the third manned lunar-lander mission. The flight was commanded by Jim Lovell. The other astronauts on board were Jack Swigert and Fred Haise. 

The craft was successfully launched toward the Moon, but two days after launch a faulty oxygen tank exploded, and the Service Module became damaged, causing a loss of oxygen and electrical power. There was a very big chance that the astronauts would die before they could return to Earth. They were very short of oxygen. Oxygen is not just used to breathe, on the Apollo spacecraft it was used in a device called a Fuel cell to generate electricity. So they conserved their remaining air by turning off almost all their electrical equipment, including heaters, so it became very cold in the spacecraft.

In order to make it back to Earth the astronauts also had to move into the Lunar Lander, that then became a sort of lifeboat.

They were not sure that when it was time for their return to Earth that their parachutes, needed to slow the Command Module down, would work. The parachutes were thrown out by small explosive charges that were fired by batteries. The cold could have made the batteries go flat, in which case they would not have been able to use their parachutes and the Command Module would have hit the ocean so fast that all aboard would have been killed. 

Apollo had taken to the Earth's orbit on the 11th April 1970 at 19:13 UTC. They flew from Cape Canaveral and they wanted to land at Fra Mauro. Despite the hardships, the crew made it back to Earth. In spite of the fact that crew did not land on the Moon, the flight became very well known.

Some people regarded it as a failure because they did not land on the Moon. However, others thought it was possibly the National Aeronautics and Space Administrations (NASAs) "greatest" accomplishment in returning three men in a very damaged spacecraft back to Earth safely. 

Books were written about the event, including one by Jim Lovell, the commander of the mission. A movie was also made about it, directed by Ron Howard and starring Tom Hanks.

V for Vendetta (movie)

V for Vendetta is a 2005 movie. The main people who are in it include Hugo Weaving as the character V and Natalie Portman as Evey Hammond. It was written by the Wachowski brothers and directed by James McTeigue. It is based on Alan Moore's graphic novel "V for Vendetta". Moore hated the movie and asked that his name not appear on it.

Evey Hammond is going out to see a co-worker named Gordon Deitrich. It is past curfew and she will get in trouble if she gets caught. As she walks, she is stopped by three police officers. She is about to be harmed when V, a man who wears a Guy Fawkes mask, comes in and rescues her. He then invites her to a concert. They go up on the roof. V waves around and the "1812 Overture" begins playing. Evey is then shocked to see the Old Bailey be destroyed as V laughs.

The next day, V enters the British Television Network (BTN). He then forces the people there to play a message. The message goes out to all households. In the tape, V tells them that they are all to blame for the current state of government. The government can tape anyone and arrest anyone and people fear it. He then tells them that he was the one that blew up the Old Bailey and to join him next November 5 if they want to stand up to the government.

The government, meanwhile, has started to pour troops into the BTN. V fights them off, but is caught. Evey, who has been hiding, taps the man on the shoulder and sprays him with pepper spray, freeing V. Evey is knocked out and wakes up inside V's location. V carried her away because he knew she would be in big trouble for helping him.

After some time, Evey comes to help V. V wants to kill a priest. She dresses up like a schoolgirl and goes into the priest's office. However, she backs out and tells the priest that V wants to kill him. The priest thinks it's a joke until V bursts in and does so. Evey runs away to Gordon's house. Gordon has his own talk show, and one day he decides to make a big joke. He makes fun of the Chancellor Adam Sutler. In response, Sutler goes into Gordon's house and arrests him.

Evey tries to escape and is caught. She is then tortured over many days. Men plunge her face into water, throw her in a cell, and shave the hair off her head, but she will not tell them any information about V. Eventually, one of the men tells her that she will be shot behind the barracks if she does not say anything. Evey says she would rather be shot; she does not have any more fear. It is then revealed that V was behind the torture and that he wanted her to have no fear. Evey is angry but soon accepts it. She later leaves but promises to come back before November 5.

Meanwhile, a Norsefire Party worker named Eric Finch begins to look into the government. He does not trust it anymore. He realizes that V is killing everyone who was at a detention camp called Larkhill. During the movie, V kills the priest, who was at the camp; a general named Lewis Prothero, who is now a talk show host; and Delia Surridge, who was a doctor. He attempts to find out more information about Larkhill. In the movie, we learn that V was a prisoner at Larkhill and blew the place up when he escaped.

Eventually, V comes to Finch. He is disguised and calls himself Rookwood. He tells them everything that Finch has long thought – that the Norsefire found a plague and decided to infect the people to put them in power.

As November 5 approaches, the city gets restless. Riots break out. V gives out thousands of Guy Fawkes masks to people for them to wear on November 5. A member of the secret police called the "Fingermen" shoots a young girl wearing one of these masks dead.

Evey comes back. V then shows her what is going to do. He has loaded explosives into a train that will go underneath the Palace of Westminster. He then gives her the choice whether to pull the trigger or not. He then disappears.

V goes to another area, where he finds Peter Creedy, the second-in-command of Norsefire. Earlier, V made a deal with him: V would turn himself in if Sutler was killed. Creedy shows Sutler, and then shoots him in the forehead. He then tells V to surrender, but V says no. In the final battle, V kills Creedy and all of his men, but is severely wounded himself. He dies in Evey's arms.

Evey puts him on the train with the explosives. Finch, who guessed that V would use a train to blow up the Palace, draws a gun and attempts to stop her. Evey says no. When Finch asks why, Evey says, "Because this country needs more than a building. It needs hope." Finch lowers his gun and allows the train to go. Because Creedy and Sutler are dead, the army outside the Palace does not know what to do. The man in charge orders them to stand down, or to put down their weapons and not do anything. The "1812 Overture" begins again, and everyone watches as the Palace of Westminster is destroyed.

North American video game crash of 1983

The North American video game crash of 1983 (also known as the North American video game crash of 1984) was a major event in the history of video games where the North American video game industry had crashed. Many makers of home computers and video game consoles went bankrupt. Many business analysts thought that the video game industry would not last, and the crash lasted for several years. However, the Japanese company Nintendo introduced the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985, which became very popular in 1987 and ended the crash.

There were several reasons for the crash, but the main reason was that companies were making many consoles and hundreds of games, most which were low quality.

Animal Crossing: Wild World

In Animal Crossing: Wild World the player moves into a village where everyone is an animal. Only the player is human. 1-4 people can move to the village and live together in one house (different to Animal Crossing). They have to pay money (called "bells") for the house, and when they did it the house will get bigger. Bells can be earned by fishing, catching insects, selling things and other ways. Every player can buy the things he likes by Tom Nook (a racoon who has got a shop in the village) and put them in the house. If the house looks nice, they get points and things from the HRA (Happy Room Academy). They also can buy clothes at Able Sisters. The game is played in real time and has no ending. You can visit the villages of other players by using the Nintendo DS wireless connection or Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. It's almost like the older Animal Crossing GameCube version.

The animals are different. There are different kinds of animals (for example cats, mice or dogs) and different characters (for example lazy, active...) There are more animals than in the older version.

Tom Nook is a racoon who has got a shop called "Nook's Cranny". The shop gets bigger when you buy things. He sells furniture and other items. He does not sell clothes anymore as he did in Animal Crossing.

Mable and Sable are two hedgehogs who have got a shop called "Able Sisters" where you can make your own clothes and buy hats, umbrellas, glasses and clothes. 

Pelly and Phyllis are two pelicans who work in the Town Hall. There is a post office where you can send letters to villagers and one where you for example can get information about your town. Pelly works at day, Phyllis works at night.

Tortimer is an old turtle. He is the mayor of your village.

K.K. is a dog who sings in the café in the museum. You can see him every Saturday evening at 8.00 pm and you can take the music with you and listen to it at home.

Blathers and Celeste are owls. Blathers works in the museum and if you want you can give him paintings, fossils, insects and fishes. After that you can see them in the museum. You can find Celeste in the observatory and draw your own pictures between the stars.

Resetti is an angry mole. He comes when you turn your DS off and do not save the game.

Mario Kart Wii

"Mario Kart Wii" features 16 new tracks, plus 16 from previous games in the series, and is bundled with the Wii Wheel. The game was commercially successful in every region, and sold over a million copies in both Japan and the United States in less than a month. It also received positive reviews from critics.

In "Mario Kart Wii", players choose a character from a roster having of up to 24 characters and from 36 cars. The cars are classified into three different weight classes. A character's weight decides the available types of karts and motorbikes, and their performance on the tracks. Each car has seven different parameters for characteristics: speed, weight, acceleration, handling, drift, off-road, and mini-turbo. "Mario Kart Wii" has 32 different tracks, having 16 new tracks, four tracks each from "Mario Kart 64", "" and "Mario Kart DS", and two each from "Super Mario Kart" and "". Plus, up to twelve characters can play in a race. Players get items by driving through item boxes, which can be used for either defense, offense, or for powering up the engine. New items from "Mario" platform games are introduced, like the "Mega Mushroom" from "New Super Mario Bros.". It allows the character to grow very big in size and flatten other players. The ""POW BLOCK"" from "Mario Bros." allows the character to send a shockwave to all the players in front of them, spinning them out of control and making them drop any items they may be carrying (there is no effect, however, on those who are airborne). One new item to the series is the "Lightning Cloud", which raises the user's top speed briefly, but shrinks the user if it is not passed on to an opponent by colliding with them.

"Mario Kart Wii" has 24 selectable Nintendo characters, more than any of the other Mario games. In addition to this, there are 12 different kinds (3 weight classes, 2 genders, 2 outfits) of the Mii, the digital avatar made by Nintendo. Twelve characters are available from the beginning; the other twelve and the two Mii variants become available after finishing certain elements of the game. The cast of characters has 19 returning characters from the series and six new characters; Baby Peach, Funky Kong, user-created Miis, Rosalina, Dry Bowser, and Baby Daisy. There are eight characters of each weight class. The Mii's weight class depends on its height and weight (this can be in the Mii Channel), and its favorite color changes the color scheme of its clothing, while the gender changes the color scheme of their cars.

"Mario Kart Wii" was officially announced at the 2007 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3); the online features and the first footage of the game was shown. Producer Hideki Konno wanted to include online features for "Mario Kart DS", but they were left out due to time constraints.

The game was called ""Mario Kart X"" internally for a while, before deciding on ""Mario Kart Wii"". General producer and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto's inputs were limited to new aspects of play such as the Wii Wheel and battles over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. The designers tested roughly 30 different prototypes with different shapes, colors and weights (based on real-life go-karts), before deciding on the final Wii Wheel design.

The game received many positive reviews, and was commercially successful in every region, and sold over a million copies in both Japan and the United States in less than a month. Joe Sinicki of Blast Magazine comments: "While it still does suffer from some of the problems of the older games, "Mario Kart Wii" takes the simple and accessible formula set by its predecessors and tweaks it enough to make it feel fresh and fun, creating one of the most entertaining and rewarding gaming experiences in quite some time."

In the week ending May 4, 2008, "Mario Kart Wii" had sold over a million copies in Japan alone, less than a month since its release in the region. In the UK, "Mario Kart Wii" was the best-selling video game in the week ending April 12, 2008, having "the eighth biggest opening sales week in UK software history," according to Chart-Track/ELSPA.

Chrono Trigger

In the year 1000 A.D. lives a boy named Crono, who was destined to save the
world from Lavos, an evil being who was born in the year 65,000,000 B.C., and
wreaks havoc in other time periods as well. Lavos burrows into the earth,
gaining strength by absorbing its resources. Lavos claims the world in the
year 1999 A.D., and the future, in the year 2300 A.D., is nearly non-existant.
There are very few people, plants are dead, there's hardly any place to rest
in the future. Back to 1000 A.D. Crono goes to the Millenial Fair, and meets
up with the princess of Guardia, Princess Nadia, or Marle. Marle loses her
pendant, which she guards with her life. Crono then gives it back to her (she
lost it because they ran into each other), and the two walk around the fair
for a bit.

That is, until Marle decides to step into the Telepod. When she steps into the
Telepod, her pendant reacts, and the Telepod carries her to the year 600 A.D.
from the year 1000 A.D. Crono and Lucca then set out to rescue Marle (Lucca
joins shortly after Crono goes), and they succeed, eventually learn of Magus,
get the Masamune, and then try and kill Magus, but fail. Then they learn that
Lavos is the real enemy and not Magus, and they also learn of the birth of
Lavos in 65,000,000 B.C., as well as the kingdom of Zeal in the year 12,000
B.C., where the evil queen Zeal resides. Zeal gathers her evil energy from
Lavos, and hopes to rule the world with him. Basically, the story is about
stopping Lavos from conquering the time periods in the game.

"Chrono Trigger" is a role-playing game. It was one of the first games to let the player see the enemies on the world before they fight them, and when he or she goes into a battle, the enemies and characters fight without going into a separate battle screen like other RPGs like "Final Fantasy" and "Dragon Quest" did at the time.

"Chrono Trigger" is thought to be one of the best Super NES games, and one of the best role-playing games too. It got great reviews, praising it for its story, gameplay, and innovation.

"Chrono Trigger" was first re-released on the PlayStation with "Final Fantasy IV" on "Final Fantasy Chronicles". It was given good reviews, but reviewers were unhappy with the long load times whenever going into a menu or battle. "Chrono Trigger" was re-released for the Nintendo DS as "Chrono Trigger DS". It has the same graphics and extras from the PlayStation version along with other extras such as new dungeons.

<doc id="115586" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=115586" title="Speed Racer (movie)">
Speed Racer (movie)

Speed Racer is a 2008 action movie. The movie stars Emile Hirsch, Christina Ricci and Matthew Fox. It was directed by the Wachowski brothers. The movie is based on the 1960s Japanese anime of the same name.


The movie begins at a race which the main character, Speed Racer, wins. The Racer family is a local, family-run company that builds and races cars.

In a flashback, it is shown that Speed Racer's older brother, Rex, died while racing the "Casa Cristo 5000", a big race that goes across two continents. It is very dangerous and the drivers are very bad. The drivers try to get other racers out of the race by hitting their cars or using tools to get them out of the race. Rex was said to be cheating in the race. This gave people a bad opinion of the racing world.

A man named Mr. Royalton saw Speed's victory and went to his house. He offered Speed a contract to race for the Royalton racing team. Speed chose not sign the contract because he loves the art of racing. Royalton got angry and told Speed that racing is only a business and that his and his family's belief in it being an art is nonsense. He said that he will make sure that Speed does not finish is next race. At the next race at Fuji, Speed did spin out and he did not finish the race.

A very shadowy group then went to the Racer family. Earlier in the movie, a racer named Taejo Togokhan was beat up. His hand was almost cut off for trying to wikt:oppose the Royalton family. He and someone named Racer X were trying to beat the Royaltons. The Royaltons wanted to buy out the Togokhan company. However, if Togokhan wins the Casa Cristo, the value of the company will go up and Royalton could not buy it. Togokhan would only race if Speed Racer was on the team. Pops said that Speed could not do so. Because of this, Speed and his girlfriend Trixie said they were skiing but went to the race instead.

At the end of the first day of the Casa Cristo, the Togokhan team was in second place. Togokhan was very mad, but Racer X told him that there was much more racing ahead. The Racer family found out that Speed was in the race and came to try and get him. When Speed refused to leave, they stayed to help the team. During the night, ninjas went into each of the team's rooms to tried to hurt them. Togokhan was given a drug that makes it hard for him to stand up. The drug stopped him from racing. Racer X and Speed fought the ninjas and won. Trixie chose to race for Togokhan.

On the second day of the race, the Togokhan team took the lead. However, during a pass in the mountain area, the Royalton people tried to kidnap and kill the racers. Spritle Racer, Speed's younger brother, hit one of the men with mud, and the rest of the Togokhan team and the Racer family fought off the bad guys. During this, the Sneak Oiler team took the lead in the race. Inside the mountain area, the Sneak Oilers dropped oil on the road. This caused Speed to fall off the mountain. He drove up the side of the mountain and took the lead to win the Casa Cristo.

It turned out that this was for nothing. Togokhan's plan all along was to win the race to make the price of the stock of his fathers company increase. They made more money when his father sold the company to the Royaltons. Speed was very mad. He drove around the track. Racer X found him and hit his car to make him stop. Speed then told Racer X that he thought that Racer X was actually Rex, his dead brother. Racer took off his mask and showed Speed that he was someone different. He then told Speed that they should not let racing change who they are.

Togokhan's sister later came up to Speed and gave him an invitation to that year's Grand Prix. The invitation was Togokhan's but he did not want it. The Racer family built a car for Speed, and they entered the race. During the race, Speeed took the lead. The Royalton car driver illegally used a spear hook to bring Speed down. The Royalton driver crashed and Speed's car stopped working. Speed slowed down. He thought hard and pushed the correct button to start the car again. He raced hard and fast to win the race. Royalton gets put on trial and is put in jail afterwards.

But it turns out that Racer X is Rex Racer, Speed Racers brother.

Allele frequency

Allele frequency refers to the different forms of a gene at a single position on a chromosome. It is the proportion of a given allele to all alleles at the same locus. It is usually expressed as a percentage.

Allele frequencies may be used to describe genetic diversity in a population. If the frequency of any allele is above 1% it is probable that natural selection is maintaining it at this level. This is because the natural mutation rate of an allele is almost always much lower than 1%.


</doc>
<doc id="115599" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=115599" title="Allele">
Allele

An allele is a form of a gene at a particular position (locus) on a chromosome. It is the bit of DNA at that place.

Typical plants and animals have two sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from each parent. These organisms are called diploid. Since such organisms have two sets of chromosomes, they have (except on the sex chromosomes) two alleles at each gene locus.

If the two alleles are identical, the individual is called a homozygote and is said to be homozygous. If instead the two alleles are different, the individual is a heterozygote and is heterozygous. 

In a heterozygote the effect of one allele may completely ‘mask’ the other. That is, the phenotype produced by the two alleles in heterozygous combination is identical to that produced by one of the two homozygous genotypes. 

The allele that masks the other is said to be dominant to the latter, and the alternative allele is said to be recessive to the former. This idea originates in the work of Gregor Mendel, the founder of genetics.

In other cases, both alleles contribute to the phenotype.

The inheritance of alleles, and their dominance, can be represented in a Punnett square.

An example is the gene for blossom colour in many species of flower. A single gene controls the colour of the petals, but there may be several different versions (or alleles) of the gene.

In this example, parents have the genotype Bb (capital letters show dominant alleles and lower-case letters to show recessive alleles). If B (capital) is found in their genotype, the flower will be red. Therefore, the only time a flower is not red is when the genotype is bb (there are no capital 'B's).
The probability of the flowers having different genotypes are: BB is 25%, Bb is 50%, and bb is 25%. The phenotype of the flower will always be red if a dominant B is in the genotype. Therefore, there is a 25% chance of getting a flower which is not red, and 75% chance of getting a flower which is red.

This is when the dominant allele is not completely dominant over the recessive allele. This means both the alleles have a degree of phenotypic expression in the hybrids. In this case the functional product formed is a little different or is intermediate between the product produced by to the dominant allele and the recessive allele.

For example: "Mirabilis jalapha". The heterozygote of this plant produces flowers in the F1 generation of the colour pink in contrast to the red (dominant) and white (recessive) homozygotes.

There are three ways alleles at a locus may differ. They are:

Two alleles different by descent may or may not be of different state. For example, one may carry a mutation, so making its DNA sequence different.

Motherwell F.C.

The Motherwell Football & Athletic Club Ltd. 
is a Scottish football club based in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire. Motherwell currently play in the Scottish Premier League; their home stadium is Fir Park. The current manager is Stuart McCall. 

Motherwell won the Scottish First Division in 1931-32, and this is the only time they have finished top of the first tier. They have won the Scottish Cup twice and the Scottish League Cup once.

The capacity at Fir Park is 13,742. It is all-seated. The average attendance for the 2010-11 season was 5,660. The club's record attendance for a home match is 35,632, against Rangers in a Scottish Cup quarter-final replay on March 12, 1952.

The highest transfer fee paid by the club was that to Everton for John Spencer in 1999 (GPB 500,000) and the highest received was that for Phil O'Donnell for his move to Celtic in 1994 (GBP 1,750,000). O'Donnell later played for Motherwell for a second time but died after collapsing on the pitch in a game against Dundee United on December 29, 2007.

Motherwell are also one of the teams that play in the Lanarkshire derby. They are the biggest of the teams.


Promotion titles:


Motherwell are currently sponsored by Cash Converters. The deal is for the 2011-12 season. They replaced Commsworld. They were also sponsored by JAXX, a German betting company and Zoom Airlines, a company owned by chairman John Boyle. One of the previous sponsors, from 2002-04, were a local company called The Untouchables.

They were very good team in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Under John McGraw, the Giants won the 1905, 1921 and 1922 World Series. At that time, they had players such as Christy Matthewson and Bill Terry. Olympic gold medalist Jim Thorpe also briefly played for the team.

Hugo Wolf

Hugo Wolf (born Windischgraz (now Slovenj Gradec, Slovenia) 13 March, 1860; died Vienna, 22 February 1903) was an Austrian composer of Slovene origin. He is famous for his Lieder (German art songs). He found new ways of expressing poetry in music. He used the song forms that had been made by Schubert and Schumann, but his harmonies bring something very new and personal to German song. He was particularly fond of the music of Richard Wagner and his tonal writing is influenced by him. He belongs to the late Romantic period.

Although he wrote other kinds of music besides Lieder, the only other piece of his which is played regularly is his "Italian Serenade".

At times Wolf worked very hard and composed a lot of music. At other times he felt unhappy and had depression. Towards the end of his life he went mad and had to go to an asylum. He died of syphilis.

His name is pronounced “Hoo-go Volf” (rhyming with “golf”).

The town where Wolf was born is now called Slovenj Gradec in Slovenia, but at that time it was part of the Austrian Empire. He was a child prodigy. When he was four he learned the piano and violin from his father. When he went to school he learned with Sebastian Weixler. Music was the only thing he was interested in at school. He changed schools but still did little work except for music. He went to Vienna to study at the Vienna Conservatory. His father did not want him to become a musician. He was made to leave the Conservatory because he did not obey their rules. Wolf said later that he left because he did not like the old-fashioned teaching.

After eight months with his family, he returned to Vienna to teach music. He had a fiery temper which did not make him an ideal teacher. However, he found some rich people who thought he was a good composer and paid him money so that he could have the time to compose.

One of his rich patrons had a daughter called Vally. Wolf fell in love with her, and he was very depressed when she left him after three years. He did not get on well with his family either. His father thought he was not trying to make a living. Wolf got a job as 
second Kapellmeister at Salzburg. However, he was not a good conductor and he soon left that job and went back to Vienna. to teach.

Wolf was fascinated by the music of Wagner. He tried to get Wagner’s attention once, running after his coach and begging Wagner to listen to his music. He was terribly sad when Wagner died. He wrote a song "Zur Ruh, zur Ruh" (“To rest, to rest") which is one of his best early works. He was very depressed because Wagner had gone and he felt that there was no one who could inspire him to compose. 

The great composer Franz Liszt became interested in him, and told him he ought to try to compose some longer pieces. He wrote a symphonic poem "Penthesilea". Wolf also became a music critic. He wrote about new pieces of music. He liked the music of Liszt, but hated the music of several other composers such as Anton Rubinstein and Johannes Brahms. He made many enemies because of the harsh things he wrote about them. People called him "Wild Wolf". He composed several works, but could not get them performed. He had been very critical of the famous Rosé Quartet, so they refused to play his music when they were asked.

He stopped writing musical criticism in 1887 and began composing once more. He wrote songs which set poems by Goethe, Joseph von Eichendorff. He wrote an orchestral work called "Italian Serenade" which is one of his best works outside Lieder. Then his father died and he did not compose for the rest of the year.

Wolf composed a lot during the years 1888 and 1889. He stayed with some friends outside Vienna and wrote songs using poetry by Mörike. He stayed with other friends and composed music to poems by Eichendorff. Then he wrote 51 Goethe songs, followed by "Spanisches Liederbuch" ("Spanish Song Book"). Wolf soon became very famous. His songs had very good reviews, although not everyone was enthusiastic. Brahms wrote bad things about him because, of course, Wolf had written bad things about Brahms.

By 1891 Wolf had become exhausted. His health became poor and he suffered from syphilis as well as from depression. He composed nothing for several years, although his fame continued to spread. Even Brahms changed his mind a wrote good reviews of his music.

Composers were always expected to write large pieces such as symphonies and operas if they were to be taken seriously. Wagner was given the words for an opera called "Der Corregidor". At first he did not want to use it because the libretto was not good, but then he decided to write the opera. However, although it was performed it never became a success.

Wolf last appeared at a concert in February 1897. Soon afterwards he went mad and had to be put in an asylum. A lady called Melanie whom he had loved visited him faithfully during his last years until his death on February 22, 1903. However, she felt very bad because she had not been faithful to her husband, and she killed herself in 1906.

Wolf is buried in the Zentralfriedhof (Central Cemetery) in Vienna, together with many other great composers.

Wolf’s true greatness lies in his Lieder. Although he tried at times to write larger musical works, his real genius lay in writing the smaller forms. He had a great feel for poetry and it is expressed beautifully in many ways: in the late-Romantic harmony which is often very chromatic, in the very original way he writes the piano accompaniments, and in the clever way in which he organizes his songs into groups with connecting themes. His most famous collections are "Mörike-Lieder" (1888), "Eichendorff-Lieder" (1889), "Goethe-Lieder" (1890), "Spanisches Liederbuch" (1891), "Italienisches Liederbuch" (1892, 1896) and "Michelangelo Lieder" (1897).

Wolf wrote hundreds of Lieder, three operas, incidental music, choral music, as well as some rarely-heard orchestral, chamber and piano music. His most famous instrumental piece is the "Italian Serenade" (1887), originally for string quartet and later arranged for orchestra.

Rosé Quartet

The Rosé Quartet was a string quartet formed by Arnold Rosé in 1882.

The group played together for 55 years, until 1938. Arnold Rosé was the first violin for the whole of that time, but the other members changed. Julius Egghard played the second violin at first; then it was Albert Bachrich, until 1905 when Paul Fischer joined. The viola player was Anton Loh, then Hugo von Steiner until 1901, then Anton Ruzitska; after 1920, Max Handl played the viola. Eduard Rosé, Arnold’s brother, was the cellist at first, but left after one season he left to get married and was replaced by Reinhold Hummer. The next cellist was Friedrich Buxbaum; cellist Anton Walter joined in 1921, but later on Buxbaum took over once more.

The group were particularly famous between 1905 and 1920, with Rosé, Fischer, Ruzitska, and Buxbaum. They were known for their great performances of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, but also some more modern composers including Arnold Schoenberg. 

The group often gave the first Vienna performances of works by Brahms, including his Clarinet Quintet and his Quintet in G major Opus 111. It also gave the first performance of Schoenberg's first and second string quartets and the sextet "Verklärte Nacht" in which they were joined by two other members of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra: Franz Jelinek, viola, and Franz Schmidt, cello.

Betta splendens

Betta Splendens is a species of fish from Thailand, often kept in aquariums. Because the males fight each other, they cannot be kept together.

Males have a tendency to have longer caudual fins. They also "flare" their gill covers wider than females. They come in many colors.

The males will fight each other and can not be put together. They will also nip (bite) the fins of some fish. The females sometimes fight but can be kept in groups.

East Asian calligraphy

The East Asian tradition of calligraphy originated and developed in China. The countries that use East Asian calligraphy are China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam.

In calligraphy, paper, ink, brush, ink stone, paperweight, and a desk pad are used.

The special paper used for calligraphy, is made of rice, paper mulberries, bamboo, hemp, etc.

The ink is made from soot and binders. It comes in sticks, and must be rubbed with water on an ink stone. Pre-mixed bottle inks are now available. Pre-mixed bottle inks are for practicing. 

The body of the brush can be made of bamboo, or rare materials like red sandalwood, glass, ivory, silver and gold. The head of the brush is made of the hair of animals, like the wolf, rabbit, deer, chicken, duck, goat, pig and tiger, etc. 

The ink stone is used to rub the solid ink stick into liquid ink. 

They are used to weigh down paper. Paperweights come in several types, and they are collectible works of art.

The desk pad is a pad made out of felt. Students use these desk pads, which are printed with grids on both sides. When placed under the paper, the grid helps to make the words the right size, and ensures correct placement.

Almost all traditionally educated men (and sometimes women) in East Asia are good in calligraphy. The most famous are:

There are several word styles in calligraphy. Some of them are; Seal Script (often called small seal script), Clerical Script (sometimes called official, draft or scribal script), Semi-cursive Script (also called running script), Cursive Script (sometimes called grass script), Regular Script (often called ‘standard script’), Edomoji, Munjado, and Kao.

Flannel

Flannel is a soft woven fabric, of various fineness. It usually does not have a nap, and instead gains its softness through the loosely spun yarn it is woven from. It is commonly used to make clothing, bed sheets, and sleepwear.

Flannel was originally made from carded wool or worsted yarn, but is now often made from either wool and cotton, or wool and synthetic fibre.

Flannelette is a light, napped cotton fabric imitating the texture of flannel. The weft is generally coarser than the warp. The flannel-like appearance is created by creating a nap from the weft; scratching it and raising it up. Flannelette can either have long or short nap, and can be napped on only one or two sides. It comes in many colours, both solid and patterned.

Flannel, flannelette and cotton flannel can be woven in either a twill weave or plain weave. The weave is often hidden by napping on one or both sides. After weaving, it is napped once, then bleached, dyed, or otherwise treated, and then napped a second time.

Anyone up for a challenge or bored and looking for a target to work on? are in need of being heavily tended to. Between cleanup and formatting, to verification and a huge amount of NPOV editing, there is a lot of work need to be done to a majority of the edits. Help from anyone with some knowledge of the Kashmir region of Pakistan/India would be greatly appreciated as this seems to be strongly biased from a Pakistani POV on the subject (mainly the Indian controlled section of the region). Articles such as for the city of Bhadrawahi definitely need help especially since our single link to the name and the first few pages of Google hits lists it as a language and not a place to live although there is a Bhadrawati but it is in central India, not northern... Finding the "most commonly used English name" for a lot of their new articles could prove to be a challenge. -- 13:50, 13 June 2008 (UTC)

Hello all,

I am aware that the conflict about Kashmir has probably gone on for too long. In any case, we will not be able to solve it. All we can do is look that our articles are as unbiased as they can be. I therefore think we should look to get editors who know the situation better than we do. These will likely be found on English-language, but mostly on Pakistani-, Indian- and Chinese-language wikipedias. I would therefore ask for a beacon of light to be sent to those projects. Our problem is not one of language - even if the articles are written very poorly, improving them is not the problem. The basic problem that we have is one of understanding the situation. I have read that the Shiazen glacier is occupied by India (Pakistani-troops are in the valley below the glacier). With my knowledge I have no idea of whether this glacier should belong to India, or to Pakistan, or be shared between the two.

What we need are people that know at least one side of the situation. Ideally, those can then work together (or is it unimaginable that a moderated Indian works with a moderated Pakistani to try to get the information right? - I don't know, and I can't tell, therefore my call for help.

So if you know any people who could help, please tell them. - Again this is not about language; this is about getting the facts right.-- () 16:51, 16 June 2008 (UTC)

How much does Simple value stubs? I'm at a cross-roads whether to pursue the List of Pokémon page or not. I could create ~460 stubs, but if there isn't a group of interested Pokémon fans that want to keep it up, I see little purpose in that. has come over, which is excellent as he's created a dozen stubs that I will be happy to work on (seems much easier to work on article after they've been created), but...that's it. Nobody else has expressed interest over from the English Wikipedia Pokémon WikiProject.

I could also go on a rampage and create a ton of stubs (diving into Wikipedia's category system has yielded and impressive comprehensiveness in terms of article count), but I feel like I should make the existing ones more useful first. Should I focus on quantity, or quality? 20:26, 16 June 2008 (UTC)

I'm proposing that there be a scale for video games - both in their quality (ie, Stub, Start, B, A, GA, VG) and in their priority to improve (ie, low, mid, high, top). I know the project has only two members at the moment, but interest is growing slowly, and I'm certain it will soon be big enough to warrant it. - () 01:53, 17 June 2008 (UTC)

Does the English Wikipedia policy "Wikipedia is not censored" apply in Simple Wikipedia? I note that the policy "" states that "Other readers [of Simple English Wikipedia] may be young (they may be children)". If that is the case, should explicit images (such as the one at "Erection") be avoided? I don't have a problem with such images personally, but wonder if there is a usage policy on this.

As our goal is to be simple, I still agree that we should stick with movie in categories. I guess I don't have a problem with pages keeping Title (film) as the format, but I'd also be fine with switching to Title (movie).

Ana Ivanović (Serbian: Ана Ивановић ) born November 6, 1987, in Belgrade, Serbia, is a Serbian tennis player. As of October 10, 2011, she is ranked as the number 20 player in the world. She was the number 1 player for ten weeks from June to September 2008. She won the French Open in 2008 and came second there in 2007. She also came second at the Australian Open in 2008. She has also played tennis for Serbia in the international tournament called the Fed Cup.

Ivanović is very tall, and is famous for the way she plays. She is best known for her powerful serve. Although she is Serbian, Ivanović currently lives in Basel, Switzerland. As of October 2011, she has earned over $8 million during her tennis career. Outside tennis, she is interested in clothes and fashion, and is an ambassador for the worldwide charity for children, UNICEF.

Ivanović was born in Belgrade in Serbia (which used to be in Yugoslavia).

After winning that competition, it was announced that she was the best female tennis player in the world. She was the first Serbian to be the world's top player. After she won the tournament, she had a "welcome home" party in Belgrade and dinner with the President of Serbia. In June 2008, Ivanović was expected to win the Wimbledon Championships, but lost in the third round. Since then, she has failed to make it past the fourth round in any Major competition.

Ivanović has also played tennis for Serbia in an international competition called the Fed Cup. As of October 2011, she has played 20 matches and won 14 of them.

Hamilton said he thought Alonso's penalty was "quite light if anything" and only regretted the loss of constructors' points. As a result of these events, the relationship between Hamilton and Alonso temporarily collapsed. The pair were not on speaking terms for a short period. 

After the Japanese Grand Prix, Alonso felt that a race stewards' verdict had settled the championship in Hamilton's favor. He said: "I'm not thinking of this championship anymore, it's been decided off the track. The drivers' briefing has no purpose. You go there to hear what Charlie Whiting and the other officials say. Twenty one drivers have an opinion, Charlie and the officials another, and so it's like talking to a wall".

Todd Bentley

Todd Bentley (born 1976) is a Canadian Evangelical Christian and evangelist. He is one of the main preachers who are part of the Charismatic revival meetings in Lakeland, Florida known as the Florida Healing Outpouring. Attendance at the meetings is now at as high as 10,000 visitors a night from around the world. Todd Bentley is increasingly considered a false prophet by Christian communities.

When Bently was a child he lived in Gibsons, British Columbia, a small place in west Canada. At the time when Todd Bentley's mother and father stopped being married, Bentley wrote in a book about himself that he made in 2008 called, "The Journey into the Miraculous", that he had problems and did illegal drugs. He also said in this book that he had drank too much alcohol. Bentley said that he changed to believe in Jesus and be a Christan, and when he did that he did not have problems with drugs or drinking alcohol anymore. He became a Christan when he was 18 years old. 

Bentley's beliefs are close to the Assemblies of God (AOG) and often speaks at meetings in AOG churches, although he is not under their authority. 

Bentley's other beliefs and style are seen as being from "Spiritual Leader" to "False Prophet" by other Christian leaders. He yells 'Bam!' during sermons, He has an unusual appearance for a preacher such as tattoos and piercings. 

At greater issue is Bentley's mysticism and spirituality, which is nontraditional for the Pentecostal and Charismatic congregations he serves and counter to others. Two major points of contention are the manner and veracity of the Faith Healing he conducts in his services and an encounter he discusses with an angel that was a harbinger of financial wellbeing. Other major theological debates have arisen from Bentley's references to several trips he has made to Heaven and meetings with the Paul the Apostle. These controversies were highlighted by the media coverage of the Lakeland revival.

Bentley heavily features faith healing, a common feature of the Charismatic movement. His behavior in conducting the healings has come under fire for the violence with which it is sometimes done. Bentley most commonly places his hands on an individual's head or area of infirmity but sometimes has more violently kicked out or hit the volunteer while calling out for the power of God to descend. In response, some people may stand and physically tremble, while others may literally fall down to the ground in what they call "falling under the power" of the Holy Spirit. The medical corroboration of both the injuries sustained by healings and the healings themselves has been a common topic of dissension in the media.

A controversy surrounds his alleged encounter with an angel he called 'Emma' at an AOG church in 2001. Bentley stated that the female angel gave him a vision of gold dust, and afterwards he received a breakthrough in terms of financial stability. Among Assembly of God congregants, especially, there was debate about whether such a professed encounter was in line with AOG doctrine as set out in the 16 Fundamental Truths The most persistent challenge was twofold; whether the experience of a specifically female angel who prophesied financial well-being was a Biblically recognized phenomenon, and whether preaching about such an encounter was theologically responsible - would it bring converts to worship such an angel rather than the God who sent her? Bentley has argued that it was God's choice, and not his own, that an angel appeared to him in that manner.

Indurain was very good at time trials. In the five Tours de France that he won, he only won two stages that were not time trials. He finished time trials much quicker than other cyclists, so he did not need to attack in mountain stages. In the 1996 Tour de France he had a bad cold and he could not win. He retired later in 1997.

Hour record

The hour record for bicycles is the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour on a bicycle. The first recorded hour record was in 1876 when F. L. Dodds rode 26.508 kilometres on a penny-farthing bicycle. Many people since then have tried to be the fastest. People trying to break the record have helped to change bicycle designs.

In 1972, the Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx set a record of 49.431 kilometres. It was the record for twelve years. Since that time technology has allowed much more aerodynamic bicycle designs. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the group that controls the sport of cycling, has made rules to make cyclists ride cycles similar to Merckx's bicycle. Instead there is now another record, the International Human Powered Vehicle Association (IHVA) hour record, for other designs. The hour record for regular bicycles is called the UCI record. 

Ondřej Sosenka holds the UCI hour record at 49.700 kilometres. Sam Whittingham holds the IHVA hour record at 86.752 kilometres.

Alberto Contador Velasco (born 6 December 1982 in Madrid) is a Spanish road bicycle racer for the Astana Team. He won the 2007 Tour de France riding for the Discovery Channel team. He also won the 2008 Giro d'Italia riding for Astana. 
Contador is very good at climbing mountains.

Contador became a professional in 2003. In 2004 he started to have headaches. A few days later, while he was racing, he crashed and went to hospital. There, doctors found a problem with a blood vessel in his brain. He needed some dangerous surgery, and needed many months to recover (get better). In 2005 he was healthy, and rode in his first Tour de France. He finished in 31st place. 

In 2006 his team had some trouble. A doctor in Spain had given drugs to athletes to help them to win. Some cyclists on Contador's team had worked with the doctor. The police wanted to check to see if Contador had taken drugs. As a result, Contador could not enter the 2006 Tour de France. Later the police decided that Contador had not taken drugs from the doctor. The case about the doctor was called the Operación Puerto doping case, and caused many problems in cycling.

Contador had to find a new team. In January 2007, he joined the Discovery Channel team, and won the famous Paris-Nice race in March. In the Tour de France, he won the 14th stage, and was second in the race to Michael Rasmussen. Rasmussen had to leave the race because he had not been honest about where he was training before the race. Because of this, Contador wore the yellow jersey, meaning he was in first place in the race, from stage 18. In stage 19, a time trial, he did not lose too much time, and started the last stage with a 23 seconds lead over Cadel Evans in second place. Evans and Contador finished with the same time, so Contador won the 2007 Tour de France.

The Discovery Channel Team stopped racing at the end of 2007, and Contador joined the Astana Team. This was the same team he had worked for in 2005, but with a new name and new people managing it. However, the group running the Tour de France decided that Astana could not join the 2008 Tour de France. One week before the 2008 Giro d'Italia, the group running it invited the Astana team to join. The team did not have much time to prepare (get ready), but Contador became the leader of the race on the 15th stage. He wore the maglia rosa (pink leader's jersey) until the finish in Milan. This meant that Contador had won his second grand tour.

Time trial

In many racing sports an athlete will compete (take part) in a time trial. This is when the athlete races over a course as fast as they can. In cross country skiing and biathlon competitions, a skier will start every 30 to 60 seconds. These are called interval starts. In cycling a time trial (TT) can be a single track race, or an individual time trial on the road. Time trials are often a part of a stage race, for example the Tour de France.
In a team time trial in cycling, a team of riders will race together. A group can ride faster than just one rider because riders following the leader are sheltered from the wind. 

In rowing, time trial races, where the boats start every 10 to 20 seconds, are usually called "head races."

The structure of the Earth, close to the other terrestrial planets, is chemically divided into layers. The Earth has an outer silicate solid crust, a highly viscous mantle, a liquid outer core that is much less viscous than the mantle, and a solid inner core.

The "crust" is the outermost layer of the Earth. It is made of silicon, oxygen, aluminum, and other small elements. The crust is solid. 

The "mantle" is the layer of the Earth right below the crust. It is made mostly of oxygen, silicon and magnesium. The mantle is a liquid

The "core" is made of solid iron and nickel, and is meant to be 5000-6000, due to the massive pressure. There is the outer core, which is a liquid layer below the mantle, and the inner core, which is the very center of the Earth. It is very hot, and the pressure is high.

The others were Paunat, Belvès, Saint Front de Périgueux, Brantôme and Terrasson). The carolingian abbey was the only one to be spared by the Vikings. This is because it does not lie on the river Dordogne or its tributaries. In 1317, Sarlat became the seat of a bishop.

Hurricane Erika (2003)

Hurricane Erika was a Atlantic hurricane that hit extreme northeastern Mexico near the Texas-Tamaulipas border. It happened on August 16, during the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. Erika was the eighth tropical cyclone, fifth tropical storm, and third hurricane of the season that year. The storm was created from a non-tropical area of low pressure that was tracked for five days before developing in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on August 14. Under the influence of a high pressure system, Erika moved quickly westward and became stronger under favorable conditions.

A weak surface area of low pressure came apart from a frontal system on August 8. It was moving southwestward during that time. On August 9, it created convection when it was passing underneath a cold-core upper-level low. As the system rapidly continued westward, a lot of the convection stayed near the center of the upper-level low, preventing development of a closed surface circulation. On August 13, while located near the northwestern Bahamas, an increase in convection made the upper-level low building downwards to the middle levels of the troposphere, which caused the development of an upper level anticyclone.

On August 14, a closed low-level circulation nearly developed to the east of Key Largo, Florida, but because of the deep convection remaining to the north over the mid-level center, it was weakened. The mid-level storm continued going westward and it moved across Florida. After crossing Florida, Hurricane Hunters showed a poor circulation, but with winds higher than tropical storm strength, and the system was designated as Tropical Storm "Erika" late on August 14 while located 85 miles (135 km) west of Fort Myers.
With well-established outflow and low levels of wind shear, Erika became stronger as the circulation became better defined. A high pressure system covered over the south-central United States, forcing the storm to move just south of due west at 25 mph (40 km/h). On August 15, convection were made into bands, and as its winds were turning into hurricane strength, an eye developed within the storm. The storm quickly weakened over the Sierra Madre Oriental, and Erika was calming down early on August 17. After entering the Gulf of California on August 18, It led to the formation of a tropical disturbance. It went to the northwest and weakened on August 20.

Buddhism in Pakistan

There are no significant Buddhist communities left in Pakistan.

A few Buddhists may still exist in Pakistan controlled Kashmir and a significant community exists in Jammu and Kashmir to the east of the Line of Control. Mostly Ladakhi and ethnically related to Tibetans (plus a few Indo-Aryan Dards), a rough dividing line between Islamic culture and Buddhist culture can be drawn through Mulbekh and Shergol in the Indus valley (to the east of Kargil) and well to the west of Leh, the Nun Kun massif and Rangdum Buddhist monastery at the head of the Suru river valley (a tributary of the Indus) on the Indian Kashmiri side of the line of control.

The region that is today known as Pakistan once had a large Buddhist population, with the majority of people in Gandhara (present day North Western Pakistan and Eastern Afghanistan) being Buddhist. Gandhara was largely Mahayana Buddhist, and was also a stronghold of Vajrayana Buddhism. The Swat Valley, known in antiquity as Uddiyana, was a kingdom tributary to Gandhara. There are many archaeological sites from the Buddhist era in Swat.

The Buddhist sage Padmasambhava is said to have been born in a village near the present day town of Chakdara in Lower Dir District, which was then a part of Uddiyana. Padmasambhava is known as Guru Rinpoche in Tibetan and it is he who introduced Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet.

Buddhism was also practiced in the Punjab and Sindh regions.

Gandhara remained a largely Buddhist land until around 800 AD, when the Pashtun people invaded the region from Southern Afghanistan and introduced the Islamic religion. 

Most Buddhists in Punjab reverted to Hinduism from 600 AD onwards. Buddhism was the faith practiced by the majority of the population of Sindh up to the Arab conquest by the Umayad Caliphate in 710 AD.

<doc id="116084" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=116084" title="Wenedyk">
Wenedyk

Wenedyk (in English: Venedic) is a made-up language. Jan van Steenbergen, a linguist and translator from the Netherlands, made it in 2002. The idea behind it is this: what would have happened if the Polish language had developed from Latin instead of Old Slavic? Wenedyk is a possible answer to that question. It is a Romance language, so almost all words are family of words in French, Italian, Romanian, and so on. But they look very different and much more like Polish. The rules for spelling and pronunciation are completely based on Polish. Other parts of the language, like grammar and sentence structure, are a mixture of Polish and Romance.

Together with other made-up languages like Brithenig (which does the same thing with Welsh), Wenedyk is part of the group of so-called "alternative languages", languages that could have existed if history had been different. With Brithenig, it is the best known example of this sort of languages. Wenedyk became known in Poland after it was written about on the Internet and in the monthly paper "Wiedza i Życie" ("Knowledge and Life").

Wenedyk is used in Ill Bethisad, a made-up world in which the Roman Empire was stronger than in real history. It is the most important language of the Republic of the Two Crowns, a country similar to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, but not broken up by partitions like Poland was.

Wenedyk uses the same letters as Polish does:

Also, there are seven sounds written by two letters:

Wenedyk is pronounced just like Polish. Stress almost always falls on the second-last syllable. A preposition and a pronoun are treated as one word, so when the pronoun has only one syllable, the preposition is stressed.

Wenedyk does not have articles, words like "a" and "the". This is an important difference with the other Romance languages and also with made-up languages like Esperanto and Ido. The reason is that Polish and most other Slavic languages do not have those words, and even in Vulgar Latin they were not so strong yet.

Words in Wenedyk can have many forms. English words have only a few (cat, cat's, cats; work, working, works, worked), but in Wenedyk a lot of forms exist where English would have used other words, like prepositions or modal verbs. In the case of nouns, pronouns and adjectives these forms are called "cases". Wenedyk has three cases:
Wenedyk also has a "vocative" (used for calling someone). Often it has the same form as the direct case, but not always: O potrze! "Oh father!"

There are three genders and four declensions (different ways of making forms). They are very much like the declensions in Latin:

Here is a chart of the pronouns (words like I, you, we, they, and so on) in Wenedyk:

Verbs have a lot of forms, too. Every pronoun has its own form:

Most tenses have special forms:

The word list of Wenedyk, made public on the internet, has more than 4000 words. This chart of 30 words shows what Wenedyk looks like when compared to other Romance languages:

Brithenig

Brithenig is constructed language that was made up by Andrew Smith from New Zealand in 1996. The idea behind it is the question what the Welsh language would have looked like if it had been a Romance instead of a Celtic language: a sister language to French, Spanish and Italian, but one that looks much like Welsh. It plays a key-role in the made-up world of Ill Bethisad, where Latin took the place of Old Celtic as the spoken language of the people in Great Britain, thus giving way to the development of Brithenig.

Brithenig is the best known example of the so-called group of "alternative languages", languages that could have existed if history had been different. Another well-known example is Wenedyk, which does the same with Polish as Brithenig does with Welsh.

EastLink was initially going to be a freeway, meaning it would not be tolled. However, the Premier of Victoria at the time, Steve Bracks lied at the time to get elected and always intended to toll the freeway. This led to people not being happy.

The interchange with the Monash Freeway, the largest in Victoria, is known as the Tom Wills interchange. This was announced on February 27, 2008. This particular interchange was chosen because it was within a short distance from Waverely Park, and the home of the Hawthorn Football Club.

Tolls are paid by either a bill sent in the mail, going and buying a pass from a shop or having a account (and having a electronic Breeze tag or another tollways type of electronic tag in the car).

He was a teacher at the Académie Julian in Paris. One of his famous students was the Scottish born landscape painter William Hart. Georges Rochegrosse, Félix Vallotton, the Americans Childe Hassam, John Henry Twachtman, John Noble Barlow, Augustus Kenderdine, and Charles A. Platt were also his pupils. He was a professor at the École des Beaux-Arts for a long time.

His paintings are usually single figures of beautiful women.

Among his best portraits were those of M. L. Reynaud and the Prince Imperial (1874). Among his many decorations were a first-class medal at the Paris Exhibition of 1878 and the medal of honor in 1886. He was a Commander of the Legion of Honor and a member of the Institut de France.

The bean machine, also known as the quincunx or Galton box, is a machine invented by Sir Francis Galton to demonstrate the law of error and the normal distribution.

The machine consists of a vertical board with interleaved rows of pins. Balls are dropped from the top, and bounce left and right as they hit the pins. Eventually, they are collected into one-ball-wide bins at the bottom. The height of ball columns in the bins approximates a bell curve.

Overlaying Pascal's triangle onto the pins shows the number of different paths that can be taken to get to each pin. 

A large-scale working model of this device can be seen at the Museum of Science, Boston.

Regression analysis

Regression analysis is a field of statistics. It is a tool to show in what way a number of independent variables (or factors) influence a dependent variable. There are different ways how this can be done. Better fitting curves are usually more work to calculate. 

"Data modeling" can be used without any knowledge of underlying processes that have generated the data; in this case the model is an empirical model. Moreover, in modelling, knowledge of the probability distribution of the errors is not required. "Regression analysis" requires assumptions to be made regarding probability distribution of the errors. Statistical tests are made on the basis of these assumptions. In regression analysis the term "model" embraces both the function used to model the data and the assumptions concerning probability distributions.

Regression can be used for prediction (including forecasting of time-series data), inference, hypothesis testing, and modeling of causal relationships. These uses of regression rely heavily on the underlying assumptions being satisfied. Regression analysis has been criticized as being misused for these purposes in many cases where the appropriate assumptions cannot be verified to hold. One factor contributing to the misuse of regression is that it can take considerably more skill to critique a model than to fit a model.

Forensic science

Forensic science (or forensics) is when different fields of science work together to answer the questions a lawyer would ask. Most often, forensics is about proving that someone was present at a place where a crime was committed. Specialists take "samples" which are later analyzed in a laboratory. Most forensic tests can take from 1 hour to one year, and investigators need to double (and triple) check the answer, so they know that the answer is the right answer. If a forensics team made a mistake the wrong person could be jailed, or they could get into trouble themselves.

Samples commonly taken include fingerprints. People also look for other things that could be used, for example a few hairs (or pieces of skin). Samples like hair or skin can be use for DNA testing, which allows to tell the gender of the person the hair is from, amongst others. 

When someone is accused of committing the crime, these pieces of evidence can then be matched up. Then, if they are correct, the person is charged.

Ronald Fisher

Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher FRS (17 February 1890 – 29 July 1962) was an English statistician, evolutionary biologist, and geneticist. He was described as "a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science". Richard Dawkins described him as "the greatest of Darwin's successors".

In 1919 Fisher started work at Rothamsted Experimental Station at Harpenden, Hertfordshire, England. Here he started a major study of the extensive collections of data recorded over many years. This resulted in a series of reports under the general title "Studies in crop variation." 

This began a period of great productivity. Over the next seven years, he pioneered the principles of the design of experiments and elaborated his studies of the analysis of variance. He studied the statistics of small samples. Perhaps even more important, he began his systematic approach of the analysis of real data as the springboard for the development of new statistical methods. 

He began to pay particular attention to the labour involved in the necessary computations, and developed practical methods. In 1925, his first book was published: "Statistical methods for research workers". This went into many editions and translations in later years, and became a standard reference work for scientists in many disciplines. In 1935, this was followed by "The design of experiments," which also became a standard.

His work on the theory of population genetics made him one of the three great figures of that field, together with Sewall Wright and J.B.S. Haldane. He was one of the founders of the neo-Darwinian modern evolutionary synthesis. In addition to founding modern quantitative genetics with his 1918 paper, he was the first to use diffusion equations to attempt to calculate the distribution of gene frequencies among populations. 

He pioneered the estimation of genetic linkage and gene frequencies by maximum likelihood methods. His 1950 paper on gene frequency clines is notable as the first application of a computer to biology.

Fisher had a long and successful collaboration with E.B. Ford in the field of ecological genetics. The outcome of this work was the recognition that the force of natural selection was often much stronger than had been appreciated. Many ecogenetic situations (such as polymorphism) were not selectively neutral, on the contrary, they were maintained by the force of selection. 

Fisher was the original author of the idea of heterozygote advantage, which was later found to play a frequent role in genetic polymorphism. The discovery of indisputable cases of natural selection in nature was one of the main strands in the modern evolutionary synthesis.

Fisher was an ardent promoter of eugenics, and he held the Chair in Eugenics at University College London from 1933 until he moved to Cambridge University as Professor of Genetics in 1943. 

His book "The genetical theory of natural selection" was started in 1928 and published in 1930, with a second edition in 1950. He developed ideas on sexual selection, mimicry and the evolution of dominance. He showed that the probability of a mutation increasing the fitness of an organism decreases proportionately with the magnitude of the mutation. He also proved that larger populations carry more variation and have a larger chance of survival. He set forth the foundations of what was to become known as population genetics.

About a third of the book concerned the applications of these ideas to humans, and presented the data available at that time. He presented a theory that attributed the decline and fall of civilizations to the fertility of the upper classes being low. 

Using the census data of 1911 for Britain, he showed that there was an inverse relationship between fertility and social class. This was partly due, he believed, to the rise in social status of families who were not capable of producing many children but who rose because of the financial advantage of having a small number of children. 

Therefore he proposed the abolishment of the economic advantage of small families by instituting subsidies (he called them allowances) to families with larger numbers of children, with the allowances proportional to the earnings of the father. He himself had two sons and six daughters. According to Yates and Mather, "His large family, reared in conditions of great financial stringency, was a personal expression of his genetic and evolutionary convictions".

The book was reviewed, among others, by physicist Charles Galton Darwin, a grandson of Charles Darwin's, and following publication of his review, C.G. Darwin sent Fisher his copy of the book, with notes in the margin. The marginal notes became the food for a correspondence running at least three years. Fisher's book also had a major influence on W.D. Hamilton and the development of his theories on the genetic basis for kin selection.

Between 1929 and 1934 the Eugenics Society also campaigned hard for a law permitting sterilisation on eugenic grounds. They believed that it should be entirely voluntary, and a right, not a punishment. They published a draft of a proposed bill, and it was submitted to Parliament. Although it was defeated by a 2:1 ratio, this was viewed as progress, and the campaign continued. Fisher played a major role in this movement, and served in several official committees to promote it.

In 1934, Fisher moved to increase the power of scientists within the Eugenics Society, but was ultimately thwarted by members with an environmentalist point of view, and he, along with many other scientists, resigned.

Conference USA is a group of college sports teams that play each other on the NCAA Division I-A level. Members of it used to be part of the Great Midwest Conference, the Metro Conference, or the Western Athletic Conference.

The conference sends several teams to bowl games every year, including the Liberty Bowl and New Orleans Bowl.

Memphis has been the most successful men's basketball team in the conference, reaching the national in 2008. (However, the NCAA later took Memphis's wins from that season away because a Memphis player had not been eligible to play.)

Sewall Wright

Sewall Green Wright (21 December 1889 – 3 March 1988) was an American geneticist. He was a founder of population genetics, and contributed to evolutionary theory. His work on path analysis was also notable. 

With R.A. Fisher and J.B.S. Haldane, he was a founder of theoretical population genetics. He is the discoverer of the inbreeding coefficient and of methods of computing it in pedigrees. He extended this work to populations, calculating the degree of inbreeding of members of populations as a result of random genetic drift. Together with Fisher, he pioneered methods for calculating the distribution of gene frequencies among populations as a result of the interaction of natural selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift. The work of Fisher, Wright, and Haldane on theoretical population genetics was a major step in the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis of genetics with evolution. Wright also made contributions to mammalian genetics and biochemical genetics.

Wright's explanation for stasis was that organisms come to occupy "adaptive peaks". In order to evolve to another, higher peak, the species would first have to pass through a valley of maladaptive intermediate stages. This could happen by genetic drift if the population is small enough. If a species was divided into small populations, some could find higher peaks. If there was some gene flow between the populations, these adaptations could spread to the rest of the species. This was Wright's "shifting balance theory" of evolution. There has been much skepticism among evolutionary biologists as to whether these rather delicate conditions hold often in natural populations. Wright had a long standing and sometimes bitter debate about this with R.A. Fisher, who felt that most populations in nature were too large for the effects of genetic drift to be important. Research by Dobzhansky and E.B. Ford showed that natural selection in the field was a much stronger force that Wright had expected. Wright's own biographer now doubts the validity of Wright's idea.

An anecdote about Wright, disclaimed by Wright himself, describes a lecture during which Wright tucked an unruly guinea pig under his armpit, where he usually held a chalkboard eraser: at the end of the lecture, Wright absent-mindedly erased the blackboard with the guinea pig.

Charizard

Charizard (known as Lizardon in Japan) is a character of the Pokémon anime and video game series. Ash, one of the main characters in the series, owns a Charizard. Known as the Flame Pokémon, Charizard are violent yet honorable creatures, flying proudly around the sky and always looking for powerful enemies to fight with. Charizard is also the version mascot of Pokémon Red and FireRed versions, and makes an appearance on the boxarts of many other Pokémon games. During an interview, Pokémon Company president Tsunekazu Ishihara said that they knew Charizard would be popular with North Americans, because they like strong, powerful characters.

Charizard are orange dragon-like Pokémon that have two wings, that are blue on the front, and orange on the back. Its belly and soles are cream-colored, while their eyes are light blue. The video games say that Charizard's wings can bring it to 4,600 feet in the sky. They can breath very hot flames that can melt anything, although it will never torch a weaker enemy. Charizard also crush their enemies with its claws. Charizard are violent yet honorable creatures, flying proudly around the sky and always looking for powerful enemies to fight with. If a Charizard is angry, the flame at the tip of its tail can be a whitish-blue color. Because of their crazy behavior, Charizard are also known to cause wildfires by accident.

Charizard has appeared many times in the Super Smash Bros. (series). Charizard first appears as a non-playable character in "Super Smash Bros." and "Super Smash Bros. Melee", as one of the Pokémon that come if a player uses a Poké Ball. In "Super Smash Bros. Brawl", Charizard is now playable, under the command of the Pokémon Trainer. The Trainer also has a Squirtle and an Ivysaur, that you can swich from at any time. It can use Flamethrower and Rock Smash. It also uses Fly and has the ability to glide. Charizard is a Heavyweight and attacks with many physical attacks. It uses Fire Blast in Pokémon Trainer's Final Smash, Triple Finish.

Described by the media as "a lean, ferocious, fire-breathing dragon [...] sleek, powerful, and utterly destructive", Charizard has been noted as one of the franchise's most popular characters. Retailers have attributed the high sales of merchandise related to the character to the popularity of the character's dragon-like design with children. Interviewed children have stated similar; they attributed its appeal to its "cool looking" appearance and associating the character with the concepts of stubbornness and power. GamesRadar described Charizard as "hands-down one of the coolest Pokémon out there", heavily praising its character design and calling it "one of the coolest" designs of the entire series. IGN editor "pokemonofthedaychick" called Charizard "certainly the most popular and perhaps the most well-balanced of any of the current starting Pokemon". The book "Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon" cited Charizard as popular with older male children who tend to be drawn to "tough or scary" characters, and compared the character's evolution from Charmander into Charizard with the loss of "cuteness" as one leaves childhood. The book "Rebuilding Attachments With Traumatized Children" stated psychiatrists utilized the character as an empowered character traumatized children who were fans of the "Pokémon" series could relate to. In 2005, search engine Yahoo! reported Charizard as one of the top Pokémon-related web searches.

Due to Charizard's appeal, it has been featured in lines of soft toys and action figures in the "Pokémon" franchise, made by Hasbro, and Tomy. In 2004, the "Charizard Medium Plush" was part of a major recall of 13 plush toys due to a manufacturing fault where tips of needles were being found with the stuffing. This caused Tomy to replace the toys with compensation or replacements. Charizard appears often in the "Pokémon Trading Card Game", most notably in the series' initial release. Cards featuring the character have been stated to be the most desired of the series, quickly rising to high prices amongst collectors and retailers. These cards overpowered and knocked out opponents in one hit.

Pacelli was born on 2 March 1876 in Rome, Italy. He studied at the Capranica Seminary and the Pontifical Gregorian University. In 1895, he earned a degree in Theology. 

Pacelli was ordained as a priest on 2 April 1899. In 1904, he was raised to the rank of Monsignor. He worked at the Office of the Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs. 

In 1917, Pope Benedict XV appointed him an archbishop and nuncio to Bavaria, Germany.

Pope Pius XI raised Pacelli to the rank of Cardinal in December 1929.

In February 1930, Cardinal Pacelli became the Vatican Secretary of State.

Cardinal Pacelli was elected Pope on 2 March 1939, which was his 63th birthday.

This form is also named "classic" and each team regularly has 5 players in open playing field 80 metres long and 20 large. Players use roundish tambourines during actions and they serve with oval tambourines. A rubber ball of 88 grams is used and the team which wins 13 games is final winner of the match: each game consists of 4 points. Professional Italian tamburello league is top level of competitions: in 2002 14 teams competed.A variant is played in a kind of stadium, with lateral wall, named "sferisterio" or "sferodromo" in Italian language.

Attribute-value system

An attribute-value system is a basic knowledge representation framework comprising a table with columns designating "attributes" (also known as "properties", "predicates," "features," "dimensions," "characteristics" or "independent variables" depending on the context) and rows designating "objects" (also known as "entities," "instances," "exemplars," "elements" or "dependent variables."). Each table cell therefore designates the value (also known as "state") of a particular attribute of a particular object.

Below is a sample attribute-value system. It represents 10 objects (rows) and five features (columns). In this example, the table contains only integer values. In general, an attribute-value system may contain any kind of data, numeric or otherwise. An attribute-value system is distinguished from a simple "feature list" representation in that each feature in an attribute-value system may possess a range of values (e.g., feature formula_1 below, which has domain of {0,1,2}), rather than simply being "present" or "absent" 

Attribute-value systems are pervasive throughout many different literatures, and have been discussed under many different names:

Tim Henman

Timothy Henry "Tim" Henman OBE (born 6 September, 1974) is a retired English tennis player, born in Oxford.

He reached the semi finals of Wimbledon many times, the first British tennis player to do so since the 1970s. He reached six grand slam semi finals and won eleven titles in his career. He once was ranked number four in the world.
He was sponsored by Adidas and Slazenger. He retired in 2007 as England's most successful tennis player of the last twenty years.

Henman comes from a sporting family. His mother and father were both interested in tennis and his grandfather played at Wimbledon in the 1940s and 50s. His grandmother also played mixed doubles at Wimbledon with his grandfather on two occasions.

Henman got 10 GCSEs at school and went into tennis training afterwards. He was told by doctors he had a type of bone disease in 1992. He carried on playing tennis anyway and he became professional aged 18 in 1992. In 1999 Henman married his long term girlfriend Lucy Heald. The couple have three daughters: Rose, Olivia and Grace.

Henman moved up the rankings very fast. By 1994, one year after becoming professional, he was 200th in the world.
By 1996 he was in the top thirty. In 1995 he became the first player ever to be from the Wimbledon tournament. Because he was angry during a match he hit the ball very hard at a ball girl and it hit her on the head.
In 1998, he was ranked one of the ten best tennis players in the world. In the same year he also reached the Wimbledon semi-final. In 2001 he had a good year at Wimbledon beating Roger Federer in straight sets. He reached the semi final only to be beaten by eventual winner Goran Ivanišević. In 2004 he reached the semi finals of Roland Garros in France but lost to Guillermo Coria. Towards the end of his career Henman did not play so well. He ended up falling to 63 in the world rankings. In 2005 he was knocked out of the second round of Wimbledon by Roger Federer. He also had a lot of injuries at this time, including many at important points in matches. 

He got an OBE in 2003 and was painted by royal artist Christian Furr in 2005.

Henman's last Wimbledon was a disappointment. He went out in the second round to Feliciano López of Spain. Shortly after he announced at announced his retirement. He had a press conference on 23 August 2007 to make it official.

West Pakistan

The province of West Pakistan was created in 14th October 1955 by the merger of the provinces, states and tribal areas of the western wing. The province was composed of twelve divisions and the provincial capital was established at Lahore. The province of East Bengal was renamed East Pakistan with the provincial capital at Dacca. The federal government moved in 1959 from Karachi to Rawalpindi (provisional capital until Islamabad was finished), whilst the federal legislature moved to DACCA.

West Pakistan formed a seemingly homogeneous block but with marked linguistic and ethnic distinctions and the "One Unit Policy" was regarded as a rational administrative reform which would reduce expenditure and eliminate provincial prejudices. However with the military coup of 1958, trouble loomed for the province when the office of Chief Minister was abolished and the President took over executive powers for West Pakistan. The province of West Pakistan was dissolved in July 1970 by President Yahya Khan.

General elections held in December 1970 saw the Awami League under Mujibur Rahman win an overall majority of seats in parliament (all but two of the 162 seats allocated to East Pakistan). The Awami League advocated greater autonomy for East Pakistan but the military government did not permit Mujibur Rahman to form a government.

This began the war between the Pakistani military and the Mukhti Bahini. The resulting refugee crisis led to the intervention by India, eventually leading to the surrender of the Pakistani Army. East Pakistan suffered a genocide of its Bengali population. East Pakistan became the independent state of Bangladesh on December 16, 1971. The term West Pakistan became redundant.

Ferozpur District

Ferozepur (Urdu:ضلع فیروزپور) founded by Firuz Shah Tughluq is a district in the Indian state of Punjab. The district is the oldest British district of Punjab. It was created in 1833 as district headquarters and was part of the earstwhile Lahore Division (now in Pakistan). 

Ferozepur has easy access by road and rail to other places such as Lahore, Okara, Kasur, Multan. The area is a center of many holy shrines and historic places. At the city of Zira, a Jain Swetambar Temple with very old brass icons and beautiful wall murals is located.

In addition to cotton and grain cultivation and agriculture-related services, Firozpur has some light manufacturing. Commercial progress is limited because it is very near the border between India and Pakistan. 

The district is administratively divided into the following tehsils:

Pathankot (, ) is a city and a municipal committee in Gurdaspur district in the Punjab State of India. It is a meeting point of Punjab and considered disputed territory by the UN. Due to its ideal location, Pathankot serves as a travel hub for the three northerly states and is a hub for the defence forces – Indian Army and Indian Air Force. Pathankot is the fifth largest city in the state of Punjab in terms of population. It is the last city in Punjab on the national highway that connects Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of Pakistan and India. This bestows strategic importance on the city and due to this strategic position Pathankot is also known as cock neck city. In the picturesque foothills of Kangra and Dalhousie, with the river Chakki flowing close by, the city is often used as a rest-stop before heading into the mountains of Jammu and Kashmir, Dalhousie, Chamba, and Kangra, deep into the Himalayas. Pathankot also has the largest military base in the whole of Asia.

<doc id="116343" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=116343" title="Kori Creek">
Kori Creek

The Kori Creek (, ) is a tidal creek between the Kutch region of the Indian state of Gujarat and the Kachchhi region of the Pakistani province of Sindh. It is in the Rann of Kutch marshland east of the Sir Creek, which is disputed between India and Pakistan. It is a 96 km (60 mi) strip of water disputed between the Republic of India and Pakistan, claimed by India as a part of the Indian Rann of Kutch marshlands. The creek, which opens up into the Arabian Sea, divides the Kutch region of the Indian state of Gujarat with the Sindh province of Pakistan. 
The long-standing dispute hinges in the actual demarcation "from the mouth of Kori Creek to the top of Kori Creek, and from the top of Kori Creek eastward to a point on the line designated on the Western Terminus". From this point onwards, the boundary is unambiguously fixed as defined by the Tribunal Award of 1968.

The creek itself is in the uninhabited marshlands. During the monsoon season between June and September, the creek floods its banks and envelops the low-lying salty mudflats around it. During the winter season, the area is home to flamingoes and other migratory birds.

The dispute is in the interpretation of the boundary line between Kutch and Sindh as depicted in a 1914 and 1925 map. At that time, the region was a part of Bombay Presidency of undivided India. After India's independence in 1947, Sindh became a part of Pakistan while Kutch became a part of India.

Pakistan lays claim to the entire creek as per paras 9 and 10 of the Bombay Government Resolution of 1914 signed between then the Government of Sindh and Rao Maharaj of Kutch. The resolution, which demarcated the boundaries between the two territories, included the creek as part of Sindh, thus setting the boundary as the eastern flank of the creek. The boundary line, known as the "Green Line", is disputed by India which maintains that it is an indicative line, known as a "ribbon line" in technical jargon. India's position is that the boundary is mid-channel as depicted in another map drawn in 1925, and implemented by the installation of mid-channel pillars back in 1924.

India supports its stance by citing the Thalweg Doctrine in International Law. The law states that river boundaries between two states may be, if the two states agree, divided by the mid-channel. Though Pakistan does not dispute the 1925 map, it maintains that the Doctrine is not applicable in this case as it only applies to bodies of water that are navigable, which the Kori Creek is not. India rejects the Pakistani stance by maintaining the fact that the creek is navigable in high tide, and that fishing trawlers use it to go out to sea. Several cartographic surveys conducted have upheld the Indian claim. Another point of concern for Pakistan is that Kori Creek has changed its course considerably over the years. If the boundary line is demarcated according to the Thalweg principle, Pakistan stands to lose a considerable portion of the territory that was historically part of the province of Sindh. Acceding to India's stance would also result in the shifting of the land/sea terminus point several kilometres to the detriment of Pakistan, leading in turn to a loss of several thousand square kilometres of its Exclusive Economic Zone under the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea.

In April 1965, a dispute there contributed to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, when fighting broke out between India and Pakistan. Later the same year, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson persuaded both countries to set up a tribunal to resolve the dispute. A verdict was reached in 1968 which saw Pakistan getting 10% of its claim of 9,000 km² (3,500 sq. miles).

The disputed region was at the center of international attention in 1999 after Mig-21 fighter planes of the Indian Air Force shot down a Pakistani Navy Breguet Atlantique surveillance aircraft over the Kori Creek on August 10, 1999, killing all 16 on board. India claimed that the plane had strayed into its airspace, which was disputed by the Pakistani navy. (See the Atlantique Incident)

Though the Kori creek has little military value, it holds immense economic gain. Much of the region is rich in oil and gas below the sea bed, and control over the creek would have a huge bearing on the energy potential of each nation. Also once the boundaries are defined, it would help in the determination of the maritime boundaries which are drawn as an extension of onshore reference points. Maritime boundaries also help in determining the limits of Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) and continental shelves. EEZs extend to 200 nautical miles (370 km) and can be subjected to commercial exploitation.

The demarcation would also prevent the inadvertent crossing over of fishermen of both nations into each others' territories.

Since 1969, there have been eight rounds of talks between the two nations, without a breakthrough. Steps to resolve the dispute include:

Since neither side has conceded ground, India has proposed that the maritime boundary could be demarcated first, as per the provisions of Technical Aspects of Law of Sea (TALOS). However, Pakistan has staunchly refused the proposal on the grounds that the dispute should be resolved first. Pakistan has also proposed that the two sides go in for international arbitration, which India has flatly refused. India maintains that all bilateral disputes should be resolved without the intervention of third-parties.

Ernst Mayr

Ernst Walter Mayr (5 July 1904, Kempten, Germany – 3 February 2005, Bedford, Massachusetts U.S.), was one of the 20th century's leading evolutionary biologists. 

He was also a well-known taxonomist, tropical explorer, ornithologist, historian of science, and naturalist. 

His work contributed to the reform of the theory of evolution that is known as modern evolutionary synthesis today. He also contributed ideas on the definition of the term "species". 

Mayr joined the faculty of Harvard University in 1953, where he also served as director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology from 1961 to 1970. He retired in 1975 as emeritus professor of zoology, showered with honors. 

After his retirement, he went on to publish more than 200 articles, in a variety of journals—more than some reputable scientists publish in their entire careers; 14 of his 25 books were published after he was 65. Even as a centenarian, he continued to write books.

Mayr was awarded the Linnean Society's prestigious Darwin-Wallace Medal in 1958. He was never awarded a Nobel Prize, but he noted that there is no Prize for evolutionary biology, and that Darwin would not have received one, either. Mayr did win a 1999 Crafoord Prize. That prize honors basic research in fields that do not qualify for Nobel awards, and is administered by the same organization as the Nobel Prize.

Neither Darwin nor anyone else in his time knew the answer to the "species problem": how multiple species could evolve from a single common ancestor. 

Ernst Mayr approached the problem with a definition for the concept species. He wrote that a species is not just a group of individuals that look similar, but a group that can breed only among themselves. 

When populations of organisms get isolated, the sub-populations will start to differ by genetic drift and natural selection over a period of time. This way, they will evolve into new species. The most rapid genetic reorganization occurs in extremely small populations that have been isolated. This happens if a species gets trapped on an island, for example.
Today, it is accepted that reproductive isolation is by far the most frequent cause of species splitting, and that geographical separation is the most frequent cause of this isolation. This was Mayr's most characteristic idea. Debate continues over the extent to which speciation occurs when a population is not so isolated.

<doc id="116444" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=116444" title="Aberdeen F.C.">
Aberdeen F.C.

Aberdeen Football Club (also known as The Dons, The Reds and The Dandies) is a Scottish professional football club based in Aberdeen. They compete in the Scottish Premier League and are one of the most successful teams in their country, having won four league titles and seven Scottish Cups. They are also the only Scottish team to have won two European trophies, both in the same year, however they have not won any silverware since 1995.

Formed in 1903 as a result of the amalgamation of three clubs from Aberdeen, they rarely challenged for honours until the 1950s, when they won each of the major Scottish trophies under manager Dave Halliday. This level of success was surpassed in the 1980s, when, under the management of Alex Ferguson, they won three league titles, four Scottish Cups and a Scottish League Cup, alongside the European honours. Aberdeen were the last club outside of the Old Firm to win a league title, in 1984–85.

Aberdeen have played at Pittodrie Stadium since their inception. The ground currently has a capacity of 22,199 and was the first all-seated and all-covered stadium in the United Kingdom. Pittodrie was also the first football stadium to feature a dugout, an invention of player and coach Donald Colman. The club's colours have been primarily red and white since 1939; before this, they played in black and gold vertical stripes.

Aberdeen attract support from the city and surrounding areas, as they are the only senior team within a wide area. Aberdeen have no geographically close rivals; their nearest neighbours at the same level are in the city of Dundee, with Dundee United having been their principal rivals in the New Firm in the 1980s. Rangers supplanted Dundee United as rivals in the late 1980s, but the rivalry, while fierce, does not approach that of the Old Firm.
For the 1904–05 season, Aberdeen adopted a black and gold striped shirt, which led to the team being nicknamed "Wasps". This strip, with only minor variations, was worn until just before the start of the Second World War. The blue shorts lasted until 1911, and then were replaced with white ones. Socks were black with gold trim, either as stripes or as a solid bar at the turndown.

In March 1939, Aberdeen changed the black and gold colours to red and white, reflecting the silver and red colours of the official City of Aberdeen arms. The first red strips were worn with white shorts, these were worn with either red or white socks from 1939 until the 1965–66 season. In 1966, Aberdeen adopted red shorts, making the official kit all-red, similar to that of Liverpool, who made a similar change at around the same time. This arrangement has continued to the present day, with several variations in design, in common with most senior clubs as the replica shirt market has expanded. In the late 1970s an Admiral strip featured five vertical white stripes on the left side of the shirt and shorts, and the early 1980s shirts—as worn at the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup final—featured white vertical pinstripes. Later design changes included significant amounts of blue, and a one season reversion to white shorts, although the all-red scheme returned in 1997.

Shirt sponsorship began in 1987, and the initial shirt sponsor was JVC. Since then, with the club making fewer appearances on the international stage, shirt sponsors have tended to be more local—they have included one of the local commercial radio stations, Northsound. Aberdeen last season had announced their intention to move away from local sponsorship. Sponsored by Apex Tubulars at the time, that deal ended at the end of the 2007/08 season. In a turnaround though, Aberdeen FC Managing Director, Duncan Fraser, announced the side would bare the name of local company Team Recruitment on their shirts for the next two seasons. It is believed no international sponsor showed interest. 

Change, or "away", strips have tended to be either white, often with black shorts, or a combination of yellow and black, referring back to the black and gold strips of the pre-war era, although for a time in the 1970s, Aberdeen sported an all-blue change strip with white socks. For the 2007–08 season, the change strip is all-white, with a third kit of yellow and black halves available if needed for European games, or in the event of a clash involving both red and white.

The club did not have an official crest before 1972, but several variations on the letters AFC had from time to time featured on the shirt, usually in some kind of cursive font. In November 1972, the club unveiled an official crest or logo, designed by Aberdonian graphic designer Donald Addison. The design represented a capital letter "A" as the side view of a football goal, with a ball forming the crossbar of the letter. This ball was crosshatched in such a way as to depict it as being inside the net, signifying the scoring of a goal. The logo was completed by the letters "FC" in smaller type at a level with the ball element. This badge was used on the shirts from around 1978, with no significant alterations until the mid-1980s when the words "Aberdeen Football Club" were added in a circular border, and the date of the club's founding, 1903, was added under the goal element. The current version of the crest, which retains these elements in a unified design, was introduced at the start of the 1997–98 season. Two stars signifying the winning of the two European cups in 1983 were introduced over the badge in the 2005–06 season.

Aberdeen have played at Pittodrie Stadium, the name of which comes from the Pictish for "place of manure", throughout their existence. The ground was first used by the original Aberdeen F.C. in 1899, in a 7–1 win over Dumbarton; when they merged with two other teams in 1903, the new club took over the old Aberdeen ground. On August 15 1903, 8,000 spectators turned up to watch the new Aberdeen draw 1-1 against Stenhousemuir, the first game played at Pittodrie by its amalgamated tenants. The club initially rented the ground, but subsequently bought it in 1920. The stadium contains 21,600 seats, but due to the directors' boxes, some sources place this figure at 22,000. The record attendance occurred on March 13 1954, when 45,061 spectators turned up for a Scottish Cup match between Aberdeen and Hearts.

The stadium consists of four stands. The Main Stand, which houses the club offices and players facilities, holds the majority of the supporters. The Merkland Road Stand is primarily for families. The South Stand is opposite the main stand and a quarter of this section is used to accommodate travelling supporters, except for Old Firm games, where half of this stand is given to the visiting fans. The newest element is the Richard Donald stand at the East, or Beach End, of the ground, and is named after former chairman Dick Donald. This is a modern, two–tier design, completed in 1993, containing hospitality suites which is significantly taller than the other structures at the ground. In 1978, Pittodrie became the first all covered, all-seater stadium in Britain.

The club are examining a move to a new stadium in Aberdeen.

"As of 12 October 2011."

Aberdeen inaugurated the Hall of Fame following the club's centenary celebrations in 2003. At the launch, it was claimed that over a five-year period, around 50 players and staff would be inducted. However, as of November 2007, the following initial inductees are still the only ones listed on the official website as members:

He is best known for his theory of gravitation, which was a competitor of Albert Einstein's general relativity. In 1914, Nordström added a space dimension to his theory. This described gravity and electromagnetism at the same time. Unluckily, Theodor Kaluza and Oskar Klein have got most attetion on this subject. Nordström is not well-known in his own home country, but what he has done is known well in other countries. Some Finnish authors call Nordström as "Finnish Einstein".

Nordström was born in Helsinki, the capital of Finland during the time when Finland was part of Russian Empire). He studied at University of Helsinki and completed his dissertation in 1908. Before this, he studied for some time in Göttingen where he met the world's best scientists. After this, he became a professor at the university. In 1910, he started his trip in Europe. He visited at Zürich, Berlin, Vienna, and Leyden. During his time in the Netherlands, he married Cornelia van Leeuwen. They had three children. 

Nordström was very close friend to Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr. He died at Helsinki in 1923 because of radioactivity. In that time, radioactivity was thought to have healing effects.

Pope Pius XI

Pope Pius XI (31 May 1857–10 February 1939), born Achille Ratti, was an Italian priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 260th Pope from 1922 to 1939. 

Ratti was ordained as a priest in 1875.

Father Ratti was a professor at the Padua Seminary from 1882 to 1888. He worked at Ambrosian Library of Milan from 1888 to 1911; and at the Vatican Library from 1911-1914.

In 1919, Pope Benedict XV made Ratti a Bishop of Lepanto. 

In 1921, Benedict named him Archbishop of Milan.

In 1921, Ratti was made a cardinal.

Cardinal Ratti was elected pope on February 6, 1922; and he chose the name Pope Pius XI.

Some of his decisions were controversial. He signed the Lateran Concordat with Italy in 1929; and he signed the Reichskoncordat with Germany in 1933.

Modern evolutionary synthesis

The Modern evolutionary synthesis is about evolution. It explains how the discoveries of Gregor Mendel fit with Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by means of natural selection. Mendel found out how we inherit our genes.

Key biologists who contributed work to the synthesis included: Julian Huxley, Theodosius Dobzhansky, Ernst Mayr, Ronald Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane, Sewall Wright, G.G. Simpson, E.B. Ford, Bernhard Rensch and G. Ledyard Stebbins.

The modern synthesis brought Darwin's idea up to date. It bridged the gap between different types of biologists: geneticists, naturalists, and palaeontologists. 

It states that: 

The idea that new species occur after populations split has been much debated. Geographical isolation often leads to speciation. In plants, polyploidy must be included in any view of speciation. 
This shows how some biologists see the synthesis. 

Almost all aspects of the synthesis have been challenged at times, with varying degrees of success. There is no doubt, however, that the synthesis was a great landmark in evolutionary biology. It cleared up many confusions, and was directly responsible for stimulating a great deal of research after WWII.

There are a number of discoveries in earth sciences and biology which have arisen since the synthesis. Listed here are some of those topics which are relevant to the evolutionary synthesis, and which seem soundly based.

The Earth is the stage on which the evolutionary play is performed. Darwin studied evolution in the context of Charles Lyell's geology, but we now know more about Earth history.







Conclusion: Our present knowledge of earth history strongly suggests that large-scale geophysical events influenced macroevolution and megaevolution. These terms refer to evolution above the species level, including such events as mass extinction, adaptive radiation, and the major transitions in evolution.

In the past thirty or so years there have been excavations in parts of the world which had scarcely been investigated before. Also, there is fresh appreciation of fossils discovered in the 19th century, but then denied or deprecated. Many outstanding discoveries have been made, and some of these have implications for evolutionary theory.

Daniela Hantuchová

Daniela Hantuchová (born April 23, 1983 in Poprad, Czechoslovakia, now Slovakia) is a Slovak professional tennis player. As of October 2011, she is ranked as World No. 25 in women's singles tennis and 29th in doubles. In the past, she has ranked as both women's singles and doubles World No. 5. She reached the semi-final of the 2008 Australian Open. She played tennis for Slovakia in an international competition called the Fed Cup, and also in the Olympic Games.

As of October 2011, she has won over $7.9 million from playing tennis. She is currently working with some coaches who work for the Sanchez-Casal Academy, usually Angel Gimenez and Eduardo Nicolas. Her Women's Tennis Association Tour mentor was Martina Navratilova. Navratilova was her doubles partner for a while in early 2005. Outside tennis, she has modelled clothes and has been in some television advertisements.

Hantuchová's parents are both scientists. Her father, Igor Hantucha, is a professor who teaches computer science. Her mother, Mariane Hantuchová, is a toxicologist. Daniela was taught to play tennis by her grandmother, Helena, when she was six years old. Helena used to be a Slovakian national champion. Even though Daniela practiced a lot at tennis, she studied hard at school as well. 

Hantuchová's parents were divorced in 2003. At the same time Hantuchová lost weight, and people became worried she was ill with anorexia. She said "I have proved that physically I don't have any problems." 

Hantuchová speaks three languages (German, Slovak, and English), and can play the piano. She has several hobbies, such as skiing and ice skating. She has been in several advertisements on television, such as the campaign for Sony with Ana Ivanović in July 2006. Hantuchová has also been in Italian "Vogue" magazine, as a model. She now lives in Monte Carlo, Monaco.

Hantuchová holds her racket in her right hand but uses both hands when playing backhand shots. She can hit the ball hard with both her forehand and backhand. She has a strong serve and can play well when close to the net. She is famous for her long legs which are long. Because she is so tall (), she can run a long way in a short amount of time, which also helps in returning shots.

Hantuchová became a professional tennis player in 1999, when she was 15 years old. She started training in Florida, but still went back to Bratislava, Slovakia, to study. She won her first WTA tournament in 2000, a doubles title which she won in Bratislava. In 2001, she played her first Grand Slam tournament at the Australian Open. Hantuchová lost in her first match in Australia to Russian player Anna Kournikova. However, she won the mixed doubles tournament, playing with Czech player Leos Friedl. Hantuchová won her second WTA doubles competition by winning with Russian player Elena Bovina in Luxembourg. She finished the year in the top 100, and was given an award by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) for being the best new player in 2001.
In 2002, Hantuchová lost in the quarter-final of both the Wimbledon Championships and the US Open. However, playing with Zimbabwean Kevin Ullyett, she won the mixed doubles at the Australian Open. She also came second in the doubles in Australia, playing with Spanish player Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. She and Ullyett lost the mixed doubles final at Wimbledon in the same season. She did win her first singles WTA tournament, beating Swiss player Martina Hingis at the Masters tournament at Indian Wells in California. She also won two more WTA doubles tournaments, in Florida and Connecticut in the United States. Both times she won with Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. Hantuchová finished the season in the top 10, and was given an award for being the most improved player in 2002 by the WTA. In January 2003, Hantuchová was the fifth best female tennis player in the world. As of June 2008, this is the best she has done. Later in 2003, she split up from her English coach, Nigel Sears. 

Sears coached Hantuchová again in 2004 and in 2005, where she won the mixed doubles at the French Open and the US Open. This means she had won all four Grand Slam mixed doubles tournaments. In June 2005, she and Japanese player Ai Sugiyama won a WTA tour doubles tournament in Birmingham, England. The same pair came second in the doubles final at the French Open. Hantuchová won her sixth WTA doubles title with Russian player Anastasia Myskina in Germany in October 2005.

Hantuchová and Sugiyama won another doubles tournament in March 2006, this time in Doha in Qatar. Hantuchová finally split up with her coach, Sears, for good in April 2006. She went on to win her eigthth WTA doubles tournament in May 2006 in Rome in Italy, again with Ai Sugiyama. Hantuchová won her second singles match WTA Tour title in March 2007, beating Svetlana Kuznetsova at Indian Wells again. She then won her third singles Tour title in October 2007, beating Swiss player Patty Schnyder in Linz in Austria. Hantuchová lost in the semi-final of the 2008 Australian Open to Serbian player Ana Ivanović‎. She also lost in the second round at Wimbledon in June 2008. Since the semi-final appearance, Hantuchová has failed to make it beyond the fourth round in any of the Grand Slam tournaments. 

Hantuchová has also played tennis for Slovakia in an international tennis competition called the Fed Cup. As of July 2011, she has played 44 matches and won 29 of them. She helped Slovakia win the Fed Cup in 2002. In 2004, she played for Slovakia in the Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. She is sponsored by sportswear company Nike and racket manufacturer Prince. As of October 2011, she has won over $7.9 million from playing tennis. She is the first Slovak woman to win this much money just from tennis tournaments.

The following table shows how far Hantuchová progressed in each of the Grand Slam singles tournaments she has played in.

Hantuchová did not play in the French Open in 2008 because she suffered a stress fracture on her right heel.

The following table is a summary of the Women's Tennis Association and Grand Slam tournaments won by Hantuchová (as of October 2011):

Sikhism is a very small minority religion in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan but has many cultural, historical and political ties to the country, and to the historical region of the Punjab.

Today, Pakistan, a nation of over 170 million, is 97% Muslim, with Christians and Hindus making up the largest minority faiths, each absorbing about 1.5% of the population. Sikhs, Zoroastrians, Buddhists, members of heterodox (according to Pakistani law) Islamic faiths and some adherents to animist religions make up the remainder. Information is scarce on minority adherents. According to the CIA there are no more than 20,000 sikhs in Pakistan. To put this in perspective had there not been a partition in 1947 then the region that is called Pakistan to day would have had around 13 million sikhs.

Bowling

Bowling is a sport where people roll a ball down a bowling lane to try to knock ten bowling pins down without going into the gutters or missing. There are other kinds of bowling as well.

The bowling ball has three holes in it that the person puts his or her ring, middle, and thumb. The person has to go up to the lane, lift the ball back, and roll the ball down a 60 foot long lane attempting to knock down nine wooden pins. If the person does not do it right, the ball might not knock all the pins down or might roll into the gutter. Players take turns rolling a ball down the lane to see who gets the highest score.

In bowling, the goal is to get the highest score. Bowling scores can be as low as 0 or as high as 300. Players get 10 chances to knock down all of the pins; each chance is called a frame. In each frame, players can try to knock down all of the pins up to two times. Players who do not knock down all of the pins after two tries get up to 9 points for the frame. One point is given for every pin knocked down, if any are knocked down at all. If players are able to knock down all of the pins on the first or second try, they are given 10 points for the frame plus bonus points. Frames in which a player knocks down all of the pins on the first try are scored as a strike. A strike is worth 10 points plus the number of pins knocked down by the player during their next two tries. If players do not score a strike but knock down all remaining on their second try, the frame is scored as a spare. A spare is worth 10 points plus the number of pins knocked down on the next try.

Players who score a strike or spare on their 10th frame are allowed to roll the ball up to two additional times to score their bonus points.

Great hall

A great hall was the main room of a royal palace, a nobleman's castle or a large manor house in the Middle Ages. At that time the word "great" meant "big". Great halls were found in France, England and Scotland and some other European countries.

A great hall was a rectangular room between one and a half and three times as long as it was wide, and also higher than it was wide. At night some members of the household might sleep on the floor of the great hall.

Two very large surviving royal halls are Westminster Hall and the Wenceslas Hall in Prague Castle. Penshurst Place in Kent, England has a hall from the 14th century. There are lots of 16th century and early 17th century halls in England, Wales and Scotland, for example those at Longleat (England), Burghley House (England), Bodysgallen Hall (Wales), Muchalls Castle (Scotland) and Crathes Castle (Scotland); however, by the late 1700s the great hall was beginning to lose its purpose.

Pittodrie Stadium

Pittodrie Stadium is a stadium in Aberdeen, Scotland. It is mostly used as a football stadium for Aberdeen F.C.

Aberdeen have played at Pittodrie Stadium throughout their existence. The ground was first used by the original Aberdeen F.C. in 1899, in a 7–1 win over Dumbarton; when they merged with two other teams in 1903, the new club took over the old Aberdeen ground. On August 15 1903, 8,000 spectators turned up to watch the new Aberdeen draw 1-1 against Stenhousemuir, the first game played at Pittodrie by its amalgamated tenants. The club initially rented the ground, but subsequently bought it in 1920. The stadium contains 21,600 seats, but due to the directors' boxes, some sources place this figure at 22,000. The record attendance occurred on March 13 1954, when 45,061 spectators turned up for a Scottish Cup match between Aberdeen and Hearts.

The stadium consists of four stands. The Main Stand, which houses the club offices and players facilities, holds the majority of the supporters. The Merkland Road Stand is primarily for families. The South Stand is opposite the main stand and a quarter of this section is used to accommodate travelling supporters, except for Old Firm games, where half of this stand is given to the visiting fans. The newest element is the Richard Donald stand at the East, or Beach End, of the ground, and is named after former chairman Dick Donald. This is a modern, two–tier design, completed in 1993, containing hospitality suites which is significantly taller than the other structures at the ground. In 1978, Pittodrie became the first all covered, all-seater stadium in Britain.

The club are examining a move to a new stadium in Aberdeen.

Today, the stadium has an unbalanced look, with one large stand aside three smaller stands. The biggest stand at the ground is the "South Stand", a massive two-tiered structure which was built in 1993. Opposite is the comparatively small "Davie Cooper Stand", named after the former player, which was built in 1995. These two stands have their advertising slogans changed whenever the club's sponsor changes.

Running along one side of the ground is the "East Stand", a former terrace which was converted into a seating area. This stand is highly distinctive in that it has the legendary "KEEP CIGARETTES AWAY FROM THE MATCH" slogan displayed below the roof, facing the pitch. Since the introduction of the smoking ban in 2006, slogans such as these are no longer needed. This stand is the stand of choice for many of the younger and more vocal fans.

Opposite the "East Stand" is the "The Phil O'Donnell Stand", which was previously known as the "Main Stand". The stand was renamed "The Phil O'Donnell Stand" in honour of the late Motherwell captain who died on the Fir Park pitch. 

It is an unusual structure in that the steel girders run for the full length of the pitch, but the stand only runs for two thirds the length of the pitch. This was due to a dispute with a home owner beside the stadium during construction, which the club lost, and thus were unable to complete the stand across the whole length of the pitch. 

During the 2007-08 season, Gretna F.C. rented Fir Park from Motherwell and played all but one of their home league games there.

The kite was created in China, about 2,800 years ago. Later it spread into other Asian countries, like (India), Japan and Korea. However, the kite only appeared in Europe by about the year 1600.

The first kites had sails made of paper or light fabrics such as silk. The poles were made from bamboo, or other strong but flexible woods, and the kite line was made from string or twine.

Modern kites are made from synthetic materials, such as ripstop nylon or more exotic fabrics on the sails. They have fiberglass or carbon fiber poles, and use dacron or dyneema for the kite lines.

Today, there are many different types of kite. Some are large and are made to look good, but some are smaller and are made for speed and competitions.

Winchester Cathedral

Winchester Cathedral is a mediaeval Anglican church in Winchester, Hampshire. It is the seat of the Bishop of Winchester.

The cathedral has the longest nave and overall length of any Gothic cathedral in Europe. By contrast, it is about half the height of Beauvais Cathedral in France.

Built between 1079 and 1532, Winchester Cathedral has had an unusual architectural history. The exterior, apart from the modified windows, gives the impression of a massive Norman building and indeed, when first completed, the Norman Cathedral was second only in size to Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome. However, the west front is now Perpendicular, with its huge window filled with fragments of medieval glass. Inside, only the crypt and the transepts have retained their Norman appearance. The spectacular Perpendicular nave with its tall arcade arches and strong vertical emphasis has been literally carved out of the original Norman interior. The Very Rev. Sykes wrote of it “Well might the visitor who enters … by the west door gasp with amazement". Winchester is also famous for its carved wooden fittings of many different periods.

Important events which took place at Winchester Cathedral include:

Forehand

The forehand in tennis is a shot made by swinging the racquet across one's body in the direction of where the player wants to place the shot. For a right-handed player, the forehand is a stroke that begins on the right side of his body, continues across his body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the left side of his body. It is considered the easiest shot to master, perhaps because it is the most natural stroke. Beginners and advanced players often have better forehands than any other shots and use it as a weapon.

In computing, an office suite, sometimes called an office software suite or productivity suite is a software suite for use by workers. The parts of an office suite are usually come together, have a standard user interface and usually can interact with each other, sometimes in ways Operating system would not normally allow.

There are three types of office suites, "offline" (e.g. Microsoft Office and Star Office), "hybrid" (e.g. Microsoft Office Live and Google Docs with Gears) and purely "online" (e.g. Thinkfree Office and Zoho Office Suite).


The most used office suite is Microsoft Office, which is available for Microsoft Windows and the Apple Macintosh. It has become a proprietary standard in office Software.

Another office suite is any of the OpenDocument suites, which use the free OpenDocument file format. The most used one is OpenOffice.org , open-source software that can be used in Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and has created several other office suites similar to it, such as the Mac-native NeoOffice. Other free or less expensive office suites include StarOffice, SSuite Office, KOffice and Celframe Office. These programs support many of the features of Microsoft Office, and can open the files it creates and save new documents in those formats.

<doc id="116689" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=116689" title="The Rake's Progress">
The Rake's Progress

The Rake's Progress is an opera by Igor Stravinsky. The libretto written by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman is based loosely on the eight paintings and engravings from the 18th century by William Hogarth called "A Rake's Progress". Stravinsky had seen these paintings in 1947 at an exhibition in Chicago.

The Rake’s Progress tells the story of a man called Tom Rakewell. The word “rake” in this sense means “someone (usually a man) who behaves in an immoral way: a man who has relationships with lots of women. 

The word “progress” in the title is ironic because Tom does not really make progress: he does not become a better man. In a sense he progresses backwards, because he starts off in a state of blissful innocence, i.e. he does not understand anything about his life, he does not know about good and bad. At the end of the opera he also does not
understand anything about his life, but that is because he has gone mad. 

Tom is like Faust because he sells his soul to the devil. In this opera the character Nick Shadow represents the devil. Tom leaves his lover Anne Trulove and goes to find lots of other women in London. He has several adventures, which are all arranged by Nick who is helping him to have a good time. In the end Tom finds himself in Bedlam which was a horrible building where mad people were sent in the 18th century.

The Rake’s Progress is the only full-length opera that Stravinsky wrote. It is unusual because it was not written in the modern way of most music of the 1950s. Because the story of the opera is set in the 18th century, the style of the music is deliberately like music from that period. It is divided into arias and recitative (big songs which are linked with simpler music which tells the story).

Stravinsky’s music in this opera is in the neoclassical style. He uses counterpoint a lot in this opera. This helped him later on to write serial music: music in which all 12 notes in an octave are equally important. Tom sings some words in the second act of The Rake’s Progress which suggest that Stravinsky is going to widen his compositional style in this way: “Vary the song, O London, change!/Disband your notes and let them range”.

Tom Rakewell wants to marry Anne Trulove. Her father does not trust Tom because he has no regular job. Tom would like to have lots of money. He meets Nick Shadow who tells him that an unknown uncle has died and left him lots of money. He says to Tom that he can be his servant and go with him to London to sort out his inheritance. 

Nick takes Tom to places where there is a lot of bad, immoral behaviour. Tom agrees to spend the night with Mother Goose in her brothel. Meanwhile Anne, who lives in the country, wonders why she has not heard from Tom. She thinks something might have happened to him, so she goes to London to look for him.

Tom is bored with his immoral way of life. He tells Nick he wants happiness, so Nick says he should marry Baba the Turk, a famous bearded lady. Soon afterwards Anne finds Tom's London house. She arrives just in time to see Tom get out of a sedan chair with Baba, whom he has just married. Tom tells Anne to leave, but he really is sorry for what has happened. 

In the next scene Tom hates his marriage to Baba, who is a strange woman. She is a chatterbox with a fiery temper. He makes her quiet by throwing his wig over her face, then he falls asleep. Nick enters with a "fantastic Baroque Machine" which seems to turn stones into bread. Tom cries out in his sleep that he wishes it were true, and waking, finds the machine he has dreamt of. Nick says to Tom that he could make a lot of money if he started a business making these machines. Nick is deceiving him: the machine does not work.

Tom has lost a lot of money, and the things in his house are being auctioned by the auctioneer Sellem. The objects for sale include Baba, who has not moved since being silenced by the wig. When she is unwrapped, she comes to life again and starts shouting angrily. She is angry about the auction that is taking place, but calms down when Anne enters. Baba tells her to find Tom and "set him right", and warns her against Nick Shaddow. She says she wants to carry on with her acting career. 

In a graveyard, Nick shows who he really is, and tells Tom that he must pay with his soul. Nick says he has worked for him for a year and a day; but as midnight strikes, Nick offers him a way of escape in the form of a game of cards, which Tom wins, but only because he was thinking of Anne. Nick has lost, and sinks into the ground, telling Tom that he is going mad. Tom is put in the madhouse called Bedlam. He believes he is Adonis and that Anne is Venus, the Roman goddess of love. Anne visits him, sings him to sleep, then quietly leaves him. When he realizes she has gone, he dies. 

In an epilogue, the main characters point out the simple moral: that the Devil finds work for idle hands (people who are lazy).

It was first performed in Venice on September 11, 1951, with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf singing the part of Anne Trulove. In 1957, it was a part of the first season of the Santa Fe Opera. The composer himself came to the rehearsals. There was an excellent production in 1975 at Glyndebourne Festival Opera which was designed by David Hockney. This production has been revived at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in July 2008.

El Muerto

El Muerto (in English, "The Dead One") is a superhero from a self-published comic book series made by Javier Hernandez. His real name is Juan Diego de la Muerte, or simply "Diego". Some of El Muerto's powers include super-strength, near-immortality, and the power to resurrect the dead. He got his powers after being kidnapped by the Aztec gods of death and destiny and being sacrificed in an ancient ritual. 

El Muerto was first published in a comic book titled, ""Daze of the Dead: The Numero Uno Edition"" at the 1998 Alternative Press Expo in San Diego, California. The character has had much success since then, and has appeared in several different mediums such as a 2007 independent film.

Juan Diego de la Muerte was born and raised in Whittier, California. He became fascinated with Aztec mythology and the Dia de los Muertos (""Day of the Dead"") traditions in Mexico. Raised Catholic, Diego often wondered what the Aztecs thought when their religion was replaced with what the Spanish conquerors believed. On his 21st birthday, Diego is excited for an upcoming Dia de los Muertos festival. Unfortunately his friends could not join him and Diego was forced to go alone. Borrowing his friend's car, Diego is dressed as an undead Mariachi. To celebrate the occasion, he got a tattoo of an Aztec skull days earlier. Unknown to him, the skull is actually a symbol of death representing the Aztec death god. The car crashes into a tree, killing Diego. He later wakes up in the land of the dead, Mictlan, where the Aztec gods Mictlantecuhtli and Tezcatlipoca sacrifice him. His heart is removed, and his facepaint is burned into his skin. He is told that he must fulfill an ancient prophecy and is sent back to the land of the living one year after his death. After he learns that he is truly dead, he finds out he has supernatural powers and decides to use them to help people.

El Muerto (movie)

El Muerto (also called The Dead One, El Muerto: The Dead One, The Dead One: El Muerto, or The Dead One: An American Legend) is a 2007 movie. It was made from the story of the comic book superhero El Muerto. It was written and directedby Brian Cox (director). Wilmer Valderrama starred as the main character, El Muerto/Diego de la Muerte. Also starring were Angie Cepeda as Diego's girlfriend, Joel David Moore as Diego's best friend, and Billy Drago played as the bad guy. The movie tells the story of Diego de la Muerte, a 21-year-old Mexican-American who is sacrificed by the Aztec gods of death and destiny to fulfill an ancient prophecy. The movie is rated PG-13 for violence and some disturbing images. The movie premiered on March 1, 2007 and was released on DVD September 18, 2007. It won the Best Feature Film Award at the first Whittier Film Festival in 2008.

At the start of the movie, a young Diego is crossing illegally in to the United States from Mexico. Along the way, he meets an old Aztec man who tells him about a shortcut across a river. Before they get there, the old man performs an ancient ritual to the Aztec god of sacrifice and dies. Diego is then left alone at the river. Ten years later, Diego is living in East Los Angeles, California. He has a girlfriend Maria Somera and lives with his best friend Zak Silver. Maria's uncle, a priest of a local church does not like Diego's sympathy for the Aztec religion. This usually causes Diego and Maria to meet in secret. When a local Dia de los Muertos (""Day of the Dead"") festival is to take place, a celebration with Aztec roots, Diego becomes excited. He dresses as an undead Mariachi with the traditional facepaint. Unfortunately, he has to go alone because both Zak and Maria are busy the night of the celebration. While driving to the festival, Diego's car crashes and he is killed. He later wakes up in Mictlan, the Aztec land of the dead. There he is sacrificed in an ancient ritual by the god of death and sent back to the land of the living a year after his death. He later learns that the old gods want to rule their world again. Three sacrifices representing the Church that took away their power must be made. This puts Maria's life is at risk because she is a descendent of one of the first churches in Mexico. Now Diego must fight against the gods that made him to save the woman he loves.

Thomas Mitchell was born in Craigend, now part of Glasgow, Scotland on June 15, 1792. He worked in his uncle's colliery (coal mine) business. He joined the British Army in 1811 with the rank of lieutenant. He fought in the Peninsula War in Spain against Napoleon. As well as actual fighting, he worked as a surveyor and made maps. After the war he made maps of the battlefields. He was made a Major in 1826, but was then put on half pay.

Mitchell was given a job as a surveyor in New South Wales in September 1827. His job was to map roads, and join existing small maps into one big map that showed all of New South Wales. After John Oxley died in 1828, Mitchell was made the Surveyor-General, in charge of all the survey work. He planned and improved the layout of roads, bridges, towns, and public reserves.

There are currently 31 pages (describing different Pokemon monsters) in that category; In total, there seem to be over 450 of such monsters. When I decided for keep the Listo of Pokemon (about two weeks ago, has since been quick deleted), I thought that there would be interest (and manpower) to maintain these pages. It however looks like the interest is omre centered around Pokemon in general and Pokemon-themed games, rather than the individual pokemons. I see two options here. Either we delete all monster-related articles (The 31 in the category), and the category, since it will then be empty. Alternatively we could come up with a way to reduce the number of pages; It looks like pokemon monsters change into other pokemon monsters, under certain conditions. An individual pokemon will not change into any other pokemon monster, but perhaps has two or three other pokemons it can change to. That would give a hint on how to group these things (into Pokemon X, and descendants). Personally, I am not interested in Pokemon monsters, so I cannot help there; my personal choice would be to delete all of them; but if somebody is interested, we might as well keep them (in some form or other).-- () 09:34, 29 June 2008 (UTC)

No verifiable evidence of the existence (future or otherwise) of the game. () 14:58, 6 July 2008 (UTC)









Result: I am closing this RfD as Delete as a G-hit test did not bring up anything to do with the game, only the article on THIS Wikipedia, therefore it is deemed a hoax. Also, the fact that all but a couple of the edits are by anoms further leads me to believe it is a hoax.

Palestine Liberation Organization

The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is a group that works to create a state for Palestinians. The group was created in 1964. 

The PLO used violence to try and get what they wanted. They hijacked airplanes to force Israel to give them what they wanted. They also sent attackers to kill people inside Israel. There were many cases of fighting between the PLO and the Israeli army.

From 1993 to 1998 the PLO made agreements with Israel that created the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), which is in charge of leading Gaza and the West Bank. The leader of the PLO used to be Yasser Arafat. He signed a series of Peace Treaties called the Oslo Accords with Yitzhak Rabin who the Prime Minister of Israel at the time. Many members of the PLO and Israel did not agree with the Accords. An Israeli who disagreed very much with the agreements killed Rabin.

Illegal prime

An illegal prime is a special prime number. Such prime numbers are called illegal, because there is a way to change them, so that they yield something illegal: a program to circumvent the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. One of the first people to find such a prime was Phil Camody. In 2001, he found a prime that contains the gzip compressed source code for a program that can circumvent the Content Scrambling System. The Content Scrambling System is used as a way to prevent DVDs from being copied. Later, other primes were found that resulted in directly runnable programs.

The United States and other countries made it illegal to publish or circulate computer programs that can circumvent copy protection. Since prime numbers are a concept from mathematics, their knowledge cannot be made illegal easily. 

Any information that can be represented in binary form can be represented as a number.

Content Scramble System

The Content Scrambling System (or Content Scramble System) is a system to encrypt and copy-protect DVDs. Such systems are generally called Digital Rights Management (or "DRM") systems. CSS uses symmetric cryptography. It was introduced in 1996; today, it is considered ineffective.

In October 1999, Jon Lech Johansen and two other people (who remained anonymous) broke the system. Originally, CSS uses 40 bit cryptographic keys; because of different design problems, the effective key length is only about 16 bits. A 450 MHz processor, current at the time could brute force crack this in less than a minute.

CSS requires special information in the lead-in (a special area) of the disc. Since the lead-in cannot be changed on recordable DVDs these cannot have CSS protection.

Rangers F.C.

Rangers Football Club are an association football team based in Glasgow, Scotland, who currently play in the Scottish Premier League. They have won 53 league titles, a world record, and have won more major trophies than any football club in the world. The club are nicknamed "The Teddy Bears", from the rhyming slang for "Gers", which in turn is short for "Rangers", and the fans are known to each other as "Bluenoses". The club's correct name is simply "Rangers F.C.", although they are sometimes referred to as "Glasgow Rangers" for European matches to avoid confusion.

For most of their history, Rangers have enjoyed a fierce rivalry with their cross-city opponents Celtic, and the two are collectively known as the Old Firm.

The club's home, the all-seated 51,082-capacity Ibrox Stadium in south-west Glasgow, has been accredited as one of UEFA's five-star stadia. The stadium was the first one in Scotland to be granted this accolade, which it now shares with Hampden Park, Scotland's national stadium.

The club colours of Rangers F.C. are royal blue, white and red.

The team's home strip invariably features a royal blue shirt (often with white and/or red trim). Traditionally this is accompanied by white shorts (often with royal blue and/or red trim) and black socks with red turn-downs. However when wearing the 'home strip' Rangers will occasionally alter the shorts and socks, sometimes replacing the black socks with white ones; or replacing the white shorts and black socks combination with royal blue shorts and socks. 

The basic design of Rangers away strips has changed far more than the traditional home strip. White and red have been the most common predominant colours for Rangers alternate strips, though dark and light blue have also featured highly.

In recent years, Rangers have also introduced a third kit. This is usually worn if both the home and away kits clash with their opponents. The colours used range from light blue to red to a very controversial tangerine.

It is ruled by China but claimed by the Republic of India. Aksai Chin is one of the two main border disputes between India and China, the other being the dispute over Arunachal Pradesh. Aksai Chin (the name literally means "Chin's desert of white stones") is a very large high-altitude desert of salt that reaches heights up to 5,000 metres. It covers an area of 42,685 km² (16,481 sq mi) of the disputed territory. Geographically part of the Tibetan Plateau, Aksai Chin is often called the Soda Plain. The region is almost uninhabited, has no permanent settlements, and receives little rain or snow as the Himalayan and other mountains block the rains from the Indian monsoon.

<doc id="116796" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=116796" title="Bury St Edmunds">
Bury St Edmunds

Bury St Edmunds is a town in the county of Suffolk, England. It is the main town in the borough of St. Edmundsbury and known for the ruined abbey near the town centre. The town linked to the Magna Carta; in 1214 the barons of England are believed to have met in the Abbey Church and promised to force King John to accept the Charter of Liberties, the document which influenced the creation of the Magna Carta. It was also the setting for two witch trials. one of which was used as a reference in the Salem Witch Trials. During the Second World War, the USAAF operated an airfield outside the town. It is also called 'Suffolk's Floral Town' due to the abbey gardens and amounts of rural land. 

Near the gardens stands Great Britain's first internally illuminated street sign called the "Pillar of Salt". When built, it needed permission because it did not conform to regulations. Bury St Edmunds is where the A1101 road, Britain's lowest road, ends. There is a network of tunnels which prove that chalk-workings took place nearby, though there is no evidence of a lot of tunnels under the town centre. Some buildings have cellars which lead into each other. Due to their unsafe nature the chalk-workings are not open to the public, although viewing is allowed to some people. Some tunnels have caused subsidence in living history.

Among interesting buildings is St Mary's Church. The Tudor King Henry VIII's sister, Mary Tudor, was re-buried in Bury's St Mary's Church, after being moved from the Abbey after her brother's dissolution of the Church six year after her death. Queen Victoria had a stained glass window fitted into the church to commemorate Mary's interment. 

On 3 March, 1974 a Turkish Airlines DC-10 jet crashed near Paris in France killing all 346 people on board. Among the victims were 17 members of Bury St Edmunds rugby club.

The town council election on 3 May 2007 was won by the "Abolish Bury Town Council" party. The party lost its majority following a by-election in June 2007 and, to date, the Town Council is still in existence.

The name "borough" comes from of "Bury" , which has cognates in other Germanic languages such as the Old Norse "borg" meaning "wall, castle"; and Gothic "baurgs" meaning "city". They all derive from Proto-Germanic "*burgs" meaning "fortress". This in turn derives from the Proto-Indo-European root "*bhrgh" meaning "fortified elevation", with cognates including Welsh "bera", "stack" and Sanskrit bhrant- "high, elevated building".

In the centre of Bury St Edmunds there is the remains of an abbey, surrounded by the Abbey Gardens, a park. The abbey is a shrine to Saint Edmund, the Saxon King of the East Angles, who was killed by the Danes in 869AD. The town grew around Bury St Edmunds Abbey, a site of pilgrimage, and developed into a flourishing cloth-making town by the 14th century. 

The abbey was largely destroyed during the 16th century with the dissolution of the monasteries but Bury remained prosperous throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. It fell into relative decline with the industrial revolution.

The Abbey Gardens which surround the ruins had an Internet bench installed in the late 1990s, which portable computers to connect to the Internet. It was the first bench of its kind, though within the first week two teenagers discovered they could also make free telephone calls from the bench. They phoned the Borough Council (owner of the bench) to notify them, then attempted to contact Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, to tell him.

Bury St Edmunds Cathedral was created when the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich was formed in 1914. The cathedral was extended with an eastern end in the 1960s, commemorated by Benjamin Britten's Fanfare for St Edmundsbury, and a new Gothic revival cathedral tower was built as part of a millennium project running from 2000 to 2005. The opening for the tower took place in July 2005, and included a brass band concert and fireworks. Parts of the cathedral remain uncompleted, including the cloisters. Many areas remain inaccessible to the public due to building work. The tower makes St Edmundsbury the only recently completed Anglican cathedral in the UK, and only a handful of Gothic revival cathedrals are being built worldwide. The tower was constructed using original fabrication techniques by six masons who placed the machine pre-cut stone individually as they arrived.

The Theatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds was built by National Gallery architect William Wilkins in 1819. It is the sole surviving Regency Theatre in the country . The theatre, owned by the National Trust underwent restoration between 2005 and 2007. Appeal patron Dame Judi Dench: It presents a full programme of performances and is also open for public tours.

Moyse's Hall Museum is one of the oldest (c. 1180) domestic buildings in East Anglia open to the public. It has collections of fine art, for example Mary Beale, costume, e.g. Charles Frederick Worth, horology, local and social history; including Red Barn Murder and Witchcraft. 

The town holds a festival in May. This including concerts, plays, dance, and lecturers culminating in fireworks. Bury St Edmunds is home to England's oldest Scout group, 1st Bury St Edmunds (Mayors Own).

The town's football club, Bury Town, are the fourth oldest non-league team in England. They are members of the Isthmian League Division One North.

The Greene King brewery is in Bury. The other brewery is The Old Cannon Brewery and public house on Cannon Street near the railway station. The brewing vessels, made for an exhibition in Japan in 1997, can be seen in the front room. Just outside the town is Bartrums Brewery, on Rougham airfield but originally in Thurston.

Another beer-related landmark is Britain's smallest public house, The Nutshell, which is on The Traverse, just off the marketplace.

Bury's largest landmark is the British Sugar factory near the A14, which processes sugar beet into refined crystal sugar. It was built in 1925 and processes beet from 1,300 growers. 660 lorry loads of beet can be accepted each day when beet is being harvested. Not all the beet can be crystallised immediately, and some is kept in solution in holding tanks until late spring and early summer, when the plant has spare crystallising capacity. The sugar is sold under the Silver Spoon name (the other major British brand, Tate & Lyle, is made from imported sugar cane). By-products include molassed sugar beet feed for cattle and LimeX70, a soil improver. A smell of burnt starch from the plant is noticeable on some days. In September 2007, rumours and a report on BBC Radio Suffolk suggested the site is to be sold in 2012 to Merlin Entertainments Group, owner of the Staffordshire theme park Alton Towers, to rebuild half the site as a similar attraction, the rest as housing and amenities.

Notable people from Bury St Edmunds include artist and printer Sybil Andrews, actor Bob Hoskins, theatre director Sir Peter Hall, artist and water deviner Neil Stalley, author Maria Lousie de la Ramé (also known as Ouida), World War II Canadian general Guy Simonds and the 18th century landscape architect Humphry Repton, as well as Thomas Clarkson fact-finder behind the abolition of the slave trade.

Notable bands from Bury St Edmunds include Jacob's Mouse, Miss Black America, The Dawn Parade and Kate Jackson (of The Long Blondes)

Although not from Bury St Edmunds, BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel lived nearby in Great Finborough and on 12 November 2004 his funeral took place at the cathedral. It was attended by a thousand people including many artists he had championed. During a peak of local musical activity in Bury St Edmunds in 2002, he referred (tongue-in-cheek) to the town as 'The New Seattle'.

Actor Ian McShane was given freedom of the borough in 1996 after he played the title role in the television series Lovejoy, filmed in and around Bury.

Bury St Edmunds is birthplace of James Moore winner of the world's first cycle race and of the first long-distance road race, from Paris to Rouen

The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) was the military aviation arm of the United States of America during and immediately after World War II. It was the direct precursor to the United States Air Force, established in 1947. At its peak strength in 1944, the USAAF had over 2.4 million men and women in service, nearly 80,000 aircraft and 783 permanent bases, and operated from more than 2,000 airfields worldwide.

The Air Corps became the Army Air Forces in June 1941 to provide the air arm a greater autonomy in which to expand more efficiently, and to provide a structure for the additional command echelons required by a vastly increased force. Although other nations already had separate air forces independent of the army or navy (such as the British Royal Air Force and the German Luftwaffe), the USAAF remained a part of the United States Army.

Salem Witch Trials

The Salem Witch Trials were a series of court hearings before local magistrates followed by county court trials to accuse people of witchcraft in Essex, Suffolk, and Middlesex Counties of colonial Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. Over 150 people were arrested and put in jail, with even more accused who were not formally pursued by the authorities. The two courts blamed twenty-nine people of the capital felony of witchcraft. Nineteen of the accused, fourteen women and five men, were hanged. Giles Corey, a man who refused to enter a plea was crushed to death under heavy stones to try to force him to. At least five more of the accused died in prison. 

Despite being generally known as the "Salem" witch trials, the preliminary hearings in 1692 were conducted in a variety of towns across the province: Salem Village, Ipswich, Andover, as well as Salem Town, Massachusetts. The best-known trials were conducted by the Court of Oyer and Terminer in 1692 in Salem Town. All twenty-six who went to trial before this court were convicted. The four sessions of the Superior Court of Judicature in 1693, held in Salem Town, but also in Ipswich, Boston, and Charlestown, produced only three convictions in the thirty-one witchcraft trials it conducted. A farm that could support an average- sized family could not support the many families of the next generation, prompting farmers to push farther into the wilderness to find land, encroaching upon the Native Americans.

The Salem Witch Trials are the basis for the Arthur Miller play "The Crucible".

Phil O'Donnell

Phillip "Phil" O'Donnell (25 March 1972 – 29 December 2007) was a Scottish football player. O'Donnell played for Motherwell, Celtic and Sheffield Wednesday over the course of his career. He died from a cardiac arrest after collapsing on the pitch on 29 December 2007.

On 29 December 2007, O'Donnell collapsed during a game against Dundee United just as he was about to be substituted. He was treated on the pitch for about five minutes by the Motherwell and Dundee United club doctors before being taken by ambulance to Wishaw General Hospital. However, he was pronounced dead at 17.18 hours. He was 35 years of age, married and had four children. 

A postmortem examination was carried out on 1 January 2008 and it was revealed O'Donnell died of left ventricular failure. His funeral was on 4 January, at St Mary's church in Hamilton.

Former Scottish First Minister Jack McConnell, MSP for Motherwell and Wishaw, was among those to pay tribute. He hailed the midfielder as a "great professional." He said, "as captain he helped transform Motherwell this season. Phil will be sadly missed by his family and by football fans but he will be mourned by the whole community."

The player was described as a "perfect gentleman" by former Scotland coach Craig Brown. He said: "It's very, very sad news, I just can't get over it. You would not get a more ideal role model for a young footballer than Phil O'Donnell. I think in his first spell at Motherwell he was probably the best box-to-box midfield player – maybe not just in Scotland but in the UK."

Motherwell and other fans laid flowers, scarves, strips and other mementos at the gates of Fir Park. The club's scheduled SPL game against Hibs at Easter Road the following Wednesday was postponed along with the club's home game with Celtic the following Sunday out of respect. Scottish Premier League chairman Lex Gold said: "We understand from Phil's family that they would appreciate it if the Motherwell v Celtic game scheduled for 6 January, 2008 could be postponed. Both clubs are happy to meet the request and we have called the game off." On 31 December the SPL postponed the Celtic v Rangers fixture scheduled for 2 January 2008 following a request by O'Donnell's former club Celtic, which was agreed by Rangers.

Players in 30 December's English Premier League matches between Derby County and Blackburn Rovers, and Manchester City and Liverpool F.C., wore black bands in his honour. Sheffield Wednesday's matches at Hull City and at home to Preston North End were preceded by a minutes applause as a mark of respect to their former player, with the Hillsborough flags flying at half-mast. All English Premiership ties in the New Year programme were preceded with either a minute of applause or silence in O'Donnell's memory. Everton and Scottish striker James McFadden, who played with O'Donnell at Motherwell, dedicated his goal to O'Donnell in Everton's 2–0 win at Middlesbrough by pointing solemnly to his black armband and then towards the sky.

Thousands of tributes from around the world have been posted on the internet. Motherwellfc.co.uk has received hundreds of written tributes from fans as far as Korea and Ukraine, as well as many emotional messages from Sevilla F.C., comparing O'Donnell's death to the similar tragedy of Antonio Puerta earlier in the season. Sevilla F.C. director of football Ramon Rodríguez Monchi said, "This is terrible news. Right now, my thoughts are with Phil's family and everybody at Motherwell. Unfortunately, with the death of Phil O'Donnell, Motherwell have suffered a similar tragedy to ours. Antonio Puerta died at the beginning of the season and I know how terrible the whole experience is. Sevilla will be available to help in any way that we are able, to heal the pain and sadness of this tragic loss."

Motherwell announced the Main Stand at Fir Park will be renamed The Phil O'Donnell Stand as a permanent tribute and Phil's team-mates will pay their own personal tribute by having his signature embroidered on their strips for the remainder of the 2007/08 season.

On 25 May, 2008 a benefit match was held at Celtic Park in memory of O'Donnell with the proceeds going to various charities. The match was between a Celtic F.C. side drawn from their 1998 title winning squad and a Motherwell F.C. side drawn from their 1991 Scottish Cup win. Other players such as David Clarkson and James McFadden played in the game. Henrik Larsson described the match as "a sad occasion but at the same time it's a kind of celebration for everything." The match finished 5-1, in front of 60,000.

Potato chip

Potato chips (also called crisps in the United Kingdom and Ireland) are thinly cut potatoes that have been baked or fried and lightly salted or seasoned. Some popular flavours of potato chips are: salt and vinegar, ketchup, sour cream and onion. They are one of the most important snack foods in Western nations.

In the 1790s, Thomas Jefferson introduced thick french fries to America from France. However, a picky customer at a restaurant at the Moon Lake Lodge in Saratoga Springs, New York, was making the chef, George Crum, angry by continually complaining that the fries were not thin enough. Finally, George Crum became so impatient he decided to exaggerate. He sliced the potatoes so thinly they could not even be pierced with a fork. Then he soaked them in ice water for 30 minutes. After he fried and salted them, he gave them to the customer - who, to his surprise, loved them. First named "Saratoga chips" in 1835, it later became well known as "potato chips". George Crum later opened his own restaurant that served his special potato chips.

Brampton, Ontario

Brampton ( or ) is the third-largest city in the Greater Toronto Area of Ontario, Canada. It is in the Peel Region. At the time of the 2006 Canadian census, Brampton's population was 433,806 people. Brampton is now the 11th largest city in Canada. 

Brampton was made into a village in 1853. It took its name from the town of Brampton, England. Brampton was once known as The Flower Town of Canada. It was called this because of the city's large greenhouse industry. Today, the city is the home of the national headquarters of Loblaw Companies, HBC/Zellers, Bacardi, Brita, Clorox and other companies. The city is also home to Canadian Forces Army Reserve unit The Lorne Scots (Peel, Dufferin and Halton Regiment).

In 1834, a man named John Elliott divided land into lots and started to sell these lots. He called the area "Brampton", and others started to do the same.

In 1853 Brampton was made into a village. During that year a small agricultural fair was started. The fair took place at the corner of Main street and Queen street. Grains, produce, and dairy products as well as Horses and cattle were sold at the fair. This fair became what is now called the Brampton Fall Fair.

The village of Brampton built its first public library in 1887. In 1907, the village got money from Andrew Carnegie to build a new library building.

Edward Dale, an immigrant from Dorking, England, opened a flower nursery in Brampton after he got to the town in 1863. Dale's Nursery became the town's largest employer, and began to export flowers around the world. The company became a town landmark, until Brampton Town Council allowed the building to be torn down in 1977. The company once had 140 greenhouses, and was the largest flower business in North America. The company also brought about the development of other nurseries in the town. Brampton became the home 48 flower nurseries.

In 1963, the town started calling itself the "Flower Town of Canada". On 24 June 2002 Brampton City Council started the "Flower City Strategy". They wanted to show the town's history of growing flowers using this strategy. In 2007 the Rose Theatre was opened
and the city started taking part in the Communities in Bloom competition as a part of their strategy.

On October 28, 2007, the Brampton Civic Hospital was opened. The Brampton Civil Hospital was built to replace the old Peel Memorial Hospital which had been closed for renovations. Since Peel Memorial Hospital closed, the residents of Brampton have not been sure what is going to happen to it. Many residents want the hospital to be re-opened. They do not think the Brampton Civic Hospital is large enough for the size of Brampton.

In September of 2007, the Rose Theatre opened in Brampton. The theatre is seen as the start of a rebuilding of Brampton's downtown . Since the theatre opened, new businesses have opened in Brampton, and old businesses have renovated.

Apollo 11

Apollo 11 was the first mission organised to send people to the moon. It was organised by NASA, the American space agency. 
It launched on July 16, 1969, carrying three astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. On July 20 the same year Armstrong and Aldrin became the first humans to land on the moon successfully while Collins flew above them. 

The mission fulfilled the challenge John F. Kennedy had made in 1961 to "land a man on the moon, and return him safely to the Earth", before the 1960s ended.

Millions of people around the world viewed the launch of Apollo 11 on television. The launch was a global event. Richard Nixon, who was then President, watched the launch from the White House. A Saturn V rocket launched the mission from the Kennedy Space Center in 1969.
About two hours after leaving Earth the Lunar Command and Landing Modules separated from the main rocket. 3 days later the crew entered Lunar Orbit (orbit around the moon). A day later the Landing section or module separated from the command module. The Landing Module landed safely on the moon with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin aboard. During the landing there were several problems with the mission computer and to avoid a crash Armstrong had to take manual control of the landing craft. They eventually landed with only 25 seconds of fuel left.

The first thing Buzz Aldrin did upon touch down of the landing module was to pray. He did not reveal his intention to do this beforehand as someone had recently filed a lawsuit against NASA to stop astronauts from taking part in religious activity while in space. Armstrong became the first human to walk and speak on the moon's surface. The first words he said were - 

For the next two and a half hours Aldrin and Armstrong took notes, photographs and drilled core samples. The landings were broadcast to over six million people worldwide via giant radio receivers in Australia. They performed many scientific experiments including the collecting of Lunar rocks and dust. An American flag was set up and photographed on the moon. 

After finishing their activity the two astronauts returned to the landing module and slept for seven hours before starting to leave. While preparing for take off Aldrin accidentally broke the circuit breaker in the ignition circuit. Armstrong used a felt tip pen to bridge the gap and prevent them from being stranded on the moon. Aldrin and Armstrong left many objects on the moon including an American flag, a few experiments and a plaque bearing a statement from the human race. The plaque read 
"Here Men From The Planet Earth First Set Foot Upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We Came in Peace For All Mankind."

The plaque also held a disc containing messages from 73 leaders of countries around the world, the word hello spoken in almost every language known to man and a picture of two humans. On July 24 the astronauts returned to Earth and were immediately placed into . NASA scientists were afraid that they may have been exposed to unknown viruses or diseases while on the moon that could be dangerous to humans.

The three astronauts stayed in quarantine for three weeks. Upon their release they were treated as heroes around the world. They had dinner with President Nixon, a parade in Mexico City and another in Washington. The three also faced multiple television interviews and guest appearances.

Wikipedia:Proposed article demotion/Archive 2

This very good article needs a serious copyediting to link all important terms, and create the missing redlinks; if that cannot be done, I propose it be demoted to good article. While we are at it, the following could/shouldin my opinion be mentioned (for comopleteness sake):
These are of course just thoughtsof mine; feel free to contribute. -- () 21:27, 19 June 2008 (UTC)

I think this is generally well-written, though has at least one single sentence paragraph. In this article, I don't think the "other websites" section really qualifies as a list of references. () 14:25, 2 July 2008 (UTC)



This really lacks references. The few that there are seem to be from IMDb, and I'm not especially convinced that it's a particularly reliable source. () 22:55, 11 July 2008 (UTC)

I do agree it lacks references but I think that IMDb is a reliable source, EN Wiki articles use it ALL the time from my experience. 
<-- I fully support demotion. Little to no references, all other which poorly formatted. Does not meet criteria. -- () 18:31, 3 October 2008 (UTC)

I think this could possibly be saved by editor who knows about the subject, but the article seems to have a very large number of quotations that are not Simple English. The referencing and wikiinking are also sparse. The "Krushchev's Options / The Krushchev Letters" subsection is of particular concern, but I'm afraid I don't know enough about the crisis to be able to fix it alone. () 22:01, 3 July 2008 (UTC)
<-- Article has no need for demotion, could use work, but not required. Not Demoted -- () 18:40, 3 October 2008 (UTC)

Not enough third-party/reliable sources; too many complex English quotations that need to explained or wikilinked. () 22:10, 22 July 2008 (UTC)
 kept as a very good article. () 18:36, 12 October 2008 (UTC)

Readable prose is just 3.3 KB, and I think there are just too many red links in this case. () 23:05, 11 July 2008 (UTC)
<-- I don't think it's yet complete (too short, IMO), has red links, not enough references (3?), I must demotion. -- () 21:45, 3 October 2008 (UTC)
Quite a few issues for me at first glance, but probably nothing which couldn't be fixed should keen and knowledgeable editors have a few spare moments. My issues:
 () 18:49, 12 October 2008 (UTC)

– () 03:20, 8 February 2009 (UTC)


I would like to propose the demotion of this article from VGA status to either GA status or no status because I have found that the article still needs to be copyedited completely for grammar and sentence fluidity/structure. Also, several of the sections are somewhat short and should probably be lengthened. These are things that should have been fixed "before" this article became a VGA. If you fix these problems, then I will withdraw my proposal for demotion. 15:03, 22 January 2009 (UTC)
 - Doesn't look too big of a problem to warrant demotion. Maybe it needs a peer review. -- 04:16, 8 February 2009 (UTC)

I don't think this article meets the good article criteria anymore because of all the red links. () 04:08, 24 February 2009 (UTC)

Although the introduction is written brilliantly and fits my requirements for being considered as a featured (very good) article, I strongly believe this article is no longer deserving of very good article status. Aside from the introduction, the rest of the article is not extensive in its information (it's actually quite short), and has only four references.


Since this article's promotion in February 2008, I think our standards for have improved significantly. I believe that for this to keep its GA tag we need to address the following issues:
 () 21:10, 4 April 2009 (UTC)

Result: Demoted - no effort made to fix the numerous issues described above after 20 days. () 11:28, 25 April 2009 (UTC)

Many, many issues here. See the article talk page. () 10:24, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

Many issues once again, most notably that virtually all references are now dead. I have left an extensive list of the minimum required to save this GA. () 14:29, 4 May 2009 (UTC)



Result: Article demoted.     08:29, 17 May 2009 (UTC)

Recently promoted during my long-term absence, I've finally had a chance to review the article. I'm 2/3 of the way through the review and have spotted well over 50 issues that I think must be resolved before this should stay as one of our . I've made extensive notes on the talk page. If anyone shows any interest in saving it from demotion, I'll happily review the remaining 1/3 of the article. () 15:39, 4 May 2009 (UTC)








Sorry, I know this was just promoted, but it fails criteria #7. I don't want to see this demoted, but the redlinks need to be created or the article should be rightly demoted as it blatantly fails criteria 7. For everyone's convenience, here are the pages that need to be created in order to fulfill the criteria:
Like I mentioned during voting, I'd be happy to help with formatting at SE Wikt if you're not familiar. · 19:09, 26 May 2009 (UTC)



1 WP and 5 WKT entries should be easy to do if people work together. My hope is that these will be created quickly and the article won't have to be demoted. And I repeat for the 3rd time (2nd time here): I will help format if someone creates the bones at SE Wikt. · 20:12, 26 May 2009 (UTC)

Are you kidding?? 

· 20:21, 26 May 2009 (UTC)


All "redlinks" removed. As for "skirting the intent of criteria 7", well you need to fix the criteria if you are likely to start opposing on the existence of short stubs "as well as" redlinks. JC and I (and others) participate in the VGA process with good faith. We never said the criteria were correct, in fact I've been a strong opponent of the pointless creation of red linked stub just to satisfy criterion 7. Indeed, one of the words Tygrrr had originally complained about (squall) had the following text just after "(sudden, violent storms with wind and rain)" - perhaps the link to the non-existent wikt article just needed to be removed altogether?

Take a look back over the most recent candidates for demotion, e.g. Cuba Missile Crisis - generally there are "dozens" of "different" issues that need to be addressed, not just a couple of minor fixes. This could all have been fixed if these really minor points could have been sorted out with resorting to this heavy-handed approach. We all have talk pages and goodness knows, JC was hardly likely to let this VGA be demoted for the sake of a couple of really minor rewords and links. () 07:16, 29 May 2009 (UTC)

Complex tag and multiple redlinks. I don't think it's in VGA shape anymore. 19:32, 10 July 2009 (UTC)


Articles that have been up for GA and are longer than this have been accused of being uncomprehensive. Also, only has ten references. () 19:58, 26 September 2009 (UTC)

Not enough content, incomplete article. No longer GA worthy. 17:44, 30 September 2009 (UTC)


I would like to demote Romania to GA status while I fix up some of the red links that were created from the new section that I added. However, I need the consensus from the community first. 19:25, 9 October 2009 (UTC)

Has the length, does not have the references. Half the article is un- or poorly referenced 23:40, 22 February 2010 (UTC)

Dundee United F.C.

Dundee United Football Club is a professional football club from Dundee, Scotland. They currently play in the Scottish Premier League, and managed by Scottish manager Craig Levein. In the 2007-08 season, they finished 5th in the Scottish Premier League, behind the Old Firm Celtic and Rangers, Motherwell F.C. and Hibernian F.C. despite a relatively impressive season. They had been very close to finishing 3rd, and reached the Scottish Cup Final only to be beaten by Rangers in a very close game.


Dundee United's home ground throughout their history has been Tannadice Park, located on Tannadice Street in the Clepington area of the city. It is situated only away from Dens Park, home of rivals Dundee F.C.; the two stadia are the closest senior football grounds anywhere in the United Kingdom.

The club have only ever played one home fixture at another venue. This was a League Cup tie against Rangers in March 1947, when despite snow rendering Tannadice unplayable, the match was able to go ahead across the road at Dens Park.

The age and proximity of their stadia has led to the possibility of both clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium being discussed on various occasions. The most recent and serious proposal for this was put forward as part of Scotland's bid to joint-host the 2008 European Football Championship, with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium with planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park. Special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules at the time forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland's failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved for the time being, although the plan was raised again in June 2008 following doubts about joint-host Ukraine's ability to stage Euro 2012 with the Scottish Football Association keen as alternative hosts.

Kilmarnock

Kilmarnock (; locally known as "Killie") is a large burgh in East Ayrshire, Scotland, with a population of 44,170. It is located roughly between Glasgow and Ayr, and is the second largest town in Ayrshire. The River Irvine runs through its eastern section, and the Kilmarnock Water passes through it, giving rise to the name 'Bank Street'.

The name comes from the Gaelic "cill" ("cell"), and the name of Saint Marnoch or Mernoc who is also remembered in the name of Portmarnock in Ireland, and Inchmarnock. It may come from the three Gaelic elements "mo", 'my', "Ernán" (name of the saint) and the diminutive "ag", giving "Church of My Little Ernán". It is believed by some that the saint founded a church there in the 7th century. There are 12 Church of Scotland congregations in the town, plus other denominations. In 2005, the Reverend David W. Lacy, minister of the town's Henderson Church, was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.

The core of the early town appears to have lain around what is now the Laigh Kirk (Low Church), although the oldest parts of the current building are no earlier than the 17th century, extending north and northwest. A comparatively modest settlement until the industrial revolution, Kilmarnock extended considerably from around 1800 onwards. This resulted in formal, planned developments such as King Street, Portland Street, Saint Marnock Street, and latterly John Finnie Street; the latter often suggested as one of the finest Victorian planned streets in Scotland.

Areas of Kilmarnock include:

Kilmarnock's traditional industries were based around textiles and heavy engineering: e.g. locomotives (Andrew Barclay and Sons) from 1837 through 1970, and valves (Glenfield and Kennedy), which are still in production; and carpets (manufactured by BMK) from the early 1900s.

The carpets manufactured in Kilmarnock were internationally known for their quality and intricacy since the late 1800s. Many locations around the world chose to install BMK carpets. Famously, RMS Titanic was carpeted using carpets manufactured by Stoddard Carpets, the parent company and successor to BMK. Primarily due to a move by the UK market towards laminated and hard-wood flooring, but also partially due to a long decline in the industry in the area as well as cheaper, but noticeably less hard-wearing foreign competition, carpet-making finally ceased in Kilmarnock in early 2005.

Archibald Finnie and his family lived at Springhill House (now a nursing home) near the Grange Academy. They owned many coal mines, pits and other companies in Springside and other places. John Finnie Street is named after one of the family. Shoes were also a major product for some time, with Saxone having a factory in the town on the site of where the Galleon leisure centre now stands.

Kilmarnock had one of the earliest tram railways in the world, running to Troon over the (recently restored) Laigh Milton viaduct. The Glasgow and South Western Railway also set up their works here, producing nearly 400 locomotives by the time it was absorbed by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. Some work continued, but heavy repairs were sent to St. Rollox. Locomotive repairs finished in 1952, and the works closed in 1959. Nevertheless locomotives are still made by Hunslett-Barclay, as well as the maintenance of existing diesel and electric multiple units. 

From 1946 tractors were also built in Kilmarnock, with a large Massey-Harris factory present on the outskirts of the town. It later became Massey-Ferguson, before closing in 1980. Glenfield and Kennedy still survives albeit with a fraction of its former workforce, which at its height numbered in the thousands. Kilmarnock however is still home to the world famous Johnnie Walker's brand Scotch whisky. On the outskirts of the town is Scotland's first privately run prison, HM Prison Kilmarnock.

The textile and manufacturing sectors across Scotland suffered significant decline in the postwar period, and in particular from the 1960s, in the face of greater foreign competition. Kilmarnock was no exception, with the closure or significant reduction of many of its traditional large employers: Glenfield and Kennedy, Massey Ferguson, BMK, and Saxone. Although significant attempts have been made to halt this decline and attract new employers, Kilmarnock saw a continuing net loss of jobs in the five years to 2005.

Although traditionally a main shopping area for most of the surrounding districts, patterns have changed over the last 20 years; traditional centres such as Ayr have been joined by new developments at Braehead and East Kilbride.

This difficult economic climate is most visible in the town centre, the eastern part of which has been extensively redeveloped, with important historic buildings such as King Street Church and the Town Hall being demolished, and Duke Street (the link from Kilmarnock Cross to the Palace Theatre and out to the London Road) built over.

More recently Portland Street, which formed the northerly part of the main shopping area, lay abandoned for many years due to a decline in retail trade and in the face of possible comprehensive redevelopment. The street has now been redeveloped, but has not yet regained its former degree of popularity, with a Gala Bingo and a J.D. Wetherspoons taking up much of one side of the street and the rest largely occupied by chain stores.

In 2004, the "Rough Guide to Scotland" described the town as "shabby and depressed, saddled with some terrible shopping centres and a grim one-way system". The town, however, contains several parks such as Howard Park, Dean Park, and Kay Park, and residential areas including London Road, Dundonald Road, McLelland Drive, and Howard Park Drive. The town also boasts a collection of gift shops, cafes, bars, and restaurants within the very desirable Bank Street area, whilst offering retail options within its retail parks at Queen's Drive and Glencairn Square.

According to the local press in November 2007, the new SNP council have drawn up a "Top Ten Hit List" on 'eyesore' buildings in the town, and their owners and have revealed plans to crack down hard on property owners who have left their buildings fall into disrepair. A plan of action is being carried out to get something done with each of these sites. Many of the buildings in disrepair are irreplaceable listed buildings such as the former ABC cinema (previously the King's Theatre) on Titchfield Street.
A four-star hotel recently opened next to Rugby Park, the home of Kilmarnock F.C., and new restaurants, such as "Merchants" and the award winning "Jefferson Restaurant" have opened in the town centre.

Regeneration activities have been discussed for Kilmarnock town centre; in early 2006, an application to Historic Scotland's Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme was successful, and as of July 2006 an application under the Heritage Lottery Fund's Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme was pending. Work has pretty much finished on a quality housing development on the gapsite of the former Kilmarnock Infirmary north of the town centre.

In the past there have been major efforts to improve the quality of life for residents in the town's worst housing estates, especially in parts of Shortlees, Longpark and Onthank. Though the physical rehabilitation of housing in these areas has partly tackled the underlying problems of social exclusion, Onthank is arguably that most successful area of regeneration in question.

Much new quality housing has been constructed on the northern fringes of the town, in order to service the demand for commuter housing. With a journey time of 20 minutes from Kilmarnock to Glasgow (roughly half that of the existing train service), the M77 motorway has transformed the link between Glasgow and Kilmarnock. The upgrading of the A77 route to Glasgow to the M77 motorway in 2005 has made Kilmarnock more accessible for commuters, and recent house price increases have reflected this.


In 1812, the famous Kilmarnock and Troon Railway opened, mainly to carry coal from the area to the harbour at Troon, but also carrying passengers.

In 1904, Kilmarnock had its own tramway system built. The name of the company was Kilmarnock Corporation Tramways. An electric power station was built in the south bank of the River Irvine at Riccarton. Overhead power lines and tram lines were laid. With continued upgrading and expansion, the tram network at its peak went from Ayr Road in Riccarton at its southerly point, to Knockinlaw Road in Beansburn in the North. At Kilmarnock Cross, the line had an easterly spur that stretched along London Road, through Crookedholm and finally terminating at Hurlford. There had been proposed extensions along Portland Road, up John Finnie Street, West Langlands Street and eventually towards Crosshouse, but by this time, increasing costs and the far more flexible motor bus had made inroads and the trams ceased operation in 1926 during the General Strike. The council decided not to restart the service and the infrastructure was soon dismantled. Today the town is served by Kilmarnock railway station.

Kilmarnock has excellent road links to Glasgow with the M77 motorway now extending as far as Fenwick.

Kilmarnock lies on the main road between Edinburgh, Livingston, South Lanarkshire, and Ayrshire (Irvine).

Kilmarnock has 17 schools; 13 primary and four secondary. There is also a college in the town, Kilmarnock College, formerly Kilmarnock Technical College. The schools are managed by East Ayrshire Council.



The town is host to a football club named Kilmarnock F.C., the oldest professional club in Scotland. Their home ground is the curiously named Rugby Park. The reason for the name of the ground is that when founded, the club played both football and rugby. The club has the largest supporter base of any team outwith Scotland's four major cities. Rugby Park was also one of the first football grounds in Scotland to have floodlights installed. In recent years the stadium has been modernised, firstly to bring it in line with the all-seating regulations, then rebuilt totally to make a new ground. It has also hosted international football matches as well as music concerts, the most recent one was when Elton John performed here in June 2005. Derek Olgavie is also a regular appearance in the Palace Theatre.

The town also regularly plays host to professional wrestling shows, promoted by the British Championship Wrestling promotion.

There are two golf courses in the town, Annanhill Golf Course and Caprington Golf Course, which has both an 18 hole course and a nine hole course. Both these courses are council owned and run by East Ayrshire Council.

The local leisure complexes include the Galleon Centre: with a 25 metre swimming pool, baby pool, ice rink, squash courts, sauna, gym, games hall, bar area, bowling green and the New Northwest Centre (formerly the Hunter Centre) which contains an up-to-date community gym and various local medical facilities.

A leisurely stroll around the town will reveal many fine buildings. Kilmarnock boasts a large number of listed buildings. The Dick Institute, opened in April 1901, was severely damaged by fire only eight years after it opened. Some of the museums collections were lost in the fire. It reopened two years after the fire in 1911. The Dick Institute was used as an Auxiliary Hospital in 1917 during World War One.It is now shared by the Arts and Museums Service, and the Libraries, Registration and Information Service. The two Art Galleries and three Museum Galleries house permanent and temporary displays of Fine Art, Contemporary Art and Craft, Local and Industrial History and Natural Sciences. The Lending Library, Audio Library, Junior Library, Reference Library, and Learning Centre are all housed on the ground floor.

The first collection of work by Scottish poet Robert Burns, "Poems, chiefly in the Scottish dialect" was published here in 1786. It was published at the current site of the Burn's Mall, dedicated to his work. This edition is known as the "Kilmarnock Edition".

Two areas of Kilmarnock, Ellerslie and Riccarton, are associated with William Wallace and his father. Claims have been made that this is the true origin of his birthplace, and recently these have been largely substantiated. The claim that Wallace was born in Elderslie near Paisley no longer seems tenable.

John Bowring, renowned polyglot and fourth governor of Hong Kong, was Member of Parliament for Kilmarnock in 1835.

In the castle of Kilmarnock, Dean Castle, there is an exhibition of armour and weapons, and the Van Raalte collection of musical instruments.


Kilmarnock - as part of East Ayrshire Council - is twinned with five European cites and has received awards from the Council of Europe for its work in twinning.

Spurgeon was the pastor of the New Park Street Chapel in London for 38 years. He was part of several controversies with the Baptist Union of Great Britain, and later had to leave that denomination. Throughout his life, Spurgeon suffered from depression and other mental illnesses. In 1857, he started a charity organisation called Spurgeon's which works all over the world.

Falkirk F.C.

Falkirk Football Club is a Scottish professional football club currently playing in the Scottish Premier League. 

In the club's early years, a wide number of pitches and stadia were used. In 1885, the site of Brockville Park in Falkirk was leased, and there the club remained until the last day of the 2002-03 season. Due to Brockville's central location in the town, and the SPL's stringent stadium requirements, the dilapidated Brockville site, home of Falkirk for over 100 years, was no longer suitable for the club's ambitions. For season 2003-04, the club groundshared with Stenhousemuir at Ochilview stadium on the outskirts of the town. At the start of 2004-05 they moved into their new purpose built stadium which meets SPL criteria. The ground currently consists of two stands with a third due to start in the coming months.

The old Brockville ground was demolished in 2003/2004 and the land is now home to a branch of the Morrisons supermarket, which has several items of Falkirk F.C. memorabilia on site, including a turnstile from the old ground.

Hampden Park

Hampden Park in Glasgow is Scotland's national football stadium. Its primary use is as the home to Queen's Park F.C. and the Scottish national football team. It is also used for pop concerts and other sporting events.

Hampden was built in 1903, though all signs of the original stadium are long gone. It is known throughout the world as an iconic home of football and celebrated its centenary on October 31 2003. The stadium also houses the offices of the Scottish Football Association, SPL and Scottish Football League. During the 2012 Olympics it will also host games during the early stages of the Olympic football tournament. It has also hosted prestigious sporting events such as the finals of the European Cup (now the UEFA Champions League) and the UEFA Cup.

Hampden will be the key stadium of the 2014 Commonwealth Games. It will host the athletics during the tournament, Glasgow having been announced as the host city on 9 November 2007.

The Scottish Cup Final is played at Hampden annually in May, for the honour of lifting the world's oldest national trophy - the Scottish Football Association Challenge Cup, made in 1873. Queen's Park were the first winners, beating Clydesdale F.C. 2-0 in the 1874 final.

Hampden Park hosted the 1960 European Cup final between Real Madrid and Eintracht Frankfurt, where over 130,000 people watched Real Madrid win 7-3. The 1976 final was also held at Hampden, when FC Bayern Munich defeated AS Saint-Etienne. Real Madrid were again victorious when Hampden Park hosted the final of the UEFA Champions League in 2002, defeating Bayer Leverkusen, aided by Zinedine Zidane's legendary "wonder goal". Hampden Park also hosted the 2007 UEFA Cup Final on May 16 when Sevilla defeated Espanyol to retain the trophy. It also held famous wins for the Scotland national football team, such as the 1-0 wins over Netherlands in November 2003, and against France in October 2006. One of the most exciting Scottish Cup Finals in history commenced at Hampden on May 4 2002 as Rangers defeated Celtic 3-2 with a last-minute diving header from Peter Løvenkrands. Diego Maradona made his international debut at Hampden Park and scored.

Among the British and European capacity records Hampden holds are:


In American football, the Scottish Claymores of NFL Europe played at the stadium between 1998 and 2004 before decamping to Hamburg to become the Hamburg Sea Devils. The league's championship game, the World Bowl, was held there in 2003. In that game, the Frankfurt Galaxy beat Rhein Fire. 

The stadium has also hosted concerts, and in 2000 was the venue for a boxing card headlined by former world champion Mike Tyson. Robbie Williams' concert in September 2006 forced the Scottish national team to play their first Euro 2008 qualifier at Celtic Park instead.

Hampden will host the athletics events at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. Glasgow was announced as the host city on 9th November 2007.

El Gato Negro

El Gato Negro (in English “The Black Cat”) is the name of two fictional superheroes that appear in comic books published by Azteca Productions. Created by Richard Dominguez, both characters made their first appearance in "El Gato Negro #1".
The first El Gato Negro was Agustin Guerrero, a former luchador from South Texas who decided to use his skills to fight crime during the early '50s and late '60s. 
The current El Gato Negro is Francisco Guerrero, grandson to the original El Gato Negro. He adopted the superhero identity after his best friend was killed in a brutal murder.
Each El Gato Negro adopts a cat-like emblem, which they display in their costume designs or equipment. Although Agustin is not from the Silver Age of comics, he is sometimes referred to as “Silver Age El Gato Negro”, because the comic book’s timeline would place him in that era.

Agustin Guerrero was an American soldier from Texas sent overseas to fight in the Korean War. Separated from his battalion, Agustin was lost in the harsh jungles. There he found an exiled Japanese warrior and assassin known as “"Nuro Neko"” ("黒い猫" - black cat). Nuro Neko trained the young soldier martial arts and the path of a warrior. After being rescued and discharged, Agustin returned to Texas to become a masked wrestler. He adopted the identity of El Gato Negro and his success as a luchador caused him to have many adventures outside of the wrestling ring before he finally retired in the late '60s.

The second and current El Gato Negro, Francisco Guerrero is a social worker by day and a vigilante by night. Francisco became the new El Gato Negro after the murder of his friend. Despite being liked by the citizens of his community, El Gato Negro is constantly being hunted by local law enforcement.

Richard Dominguez is currently in talks for a El Gato Negro movie.

Richard Dominguez

Richard Dominguez (born Eufrancio Ricardo Dominguez September 22, 1960 in Dallas, Texas) is an American comic book creator, best known for making the comic book "El Gato Negro".

Richard Dominguez was born in Dallas, Texas on September 22, 1960 as the second of seven children. Dominguez first read comics at the age of six. He was first interested in art while in high school. He took classes in Commercial Art and later took Life Drawing classes in community college. Richard later worked as an intern for art and design studios in the late '80s and early '90s.

Richard made the Azteca Productions company and imprint in 1993. The first publication was "El Gato Negro #1". Dominguez first got the idea for El Gato Negro in the late '80s. He originally planned thought of putting the character in a team of superheroes. Liking the character better on his own, Dominguez left the original project and focused on El Gato Negro. A lot of the character’s personality and look was inspired by Dominguez’s favorite superheroes like The Spirit, The Crimson Avenger, Daredevil, Nightwing, The Shadow, The Phantom, Zorro and Batman. The character has been popular since his introduction. and other media Dominguez is currently looking to make a movie on the character.

Dominguez made his superhero group with the help of friend and writer Michael S. Moore in 1997 in a book called Team Tejas. Richard stopped publishing his books after 1997 to spend time with his family. He later came back to publish new El Gato Negro stories in 2004. Other books he plans on publishing are Lucha Grande Comics, The Acolyte, Demon Hunter, and a revival of Judge Margarito C. Garza's Relampago! 

The Professional Amigos of Comic Art Society or P.A.C.A.S. was a non-profit organization made by Richard Dominguez with his friends Carlos Saldaña, Jose Martinez, and Fernando Rodriguez in 1995. The group was made to bring together different artists, comic book and cartoon creators together to help with eachother’s projects. P.A.C.A.S. grew to over 50 members. Most of them lived in California. The P.A.C.A.S. group no longer exists but there are rumors of a new one being made. Only an official website and MySpace page stand in tribute to their effort.

McDonnell Douglas DC-10

The McDonnell Douglas DC-10 is an American three-engine medium- to long-range widebody airliner, with two engines mounted on underwing pylons and a third engine at the base of the vertical stabilizer. The model was a successor to the company's DC-8 for long-range operations, and competed in the same markets as the Airbus A300, Boeing 747, and Lockheed L-1011 Tristar, which has a similar layout to the DC-10.

Production of the DC-10 ended in December 1988 with 386 delivered to airlines and 60 to the U.S. Air Force as air-to-air refueling tankers, designated the KC-10 Extender. The DC-10 was succeeded by the related McDonnell Douglas MD-11 which entered service in 1990.

Douglas Aircraft began design studies based on its CX-HLS design. In 1966, American Airlines offered a specification to manufacturers for a widebody aircraft smaller than the Boeing 747 but capable of flying similar long-range routes from airports with shorter runways. The DC-10 became McDonnell Douglas's first commercial airliner after the merger between McDonnell Aircraft Corporation and Douglas Aircraft Company in 1967. The DC-10 was first ordered by launch customers American Airlines with 25 orders, and United Airlines with 30 orders and 30 options in 1968. The DC-10, a series 10 model, made its first flight on August 29, 1970. Following a flight test program with 929 flights covering 1,551 hours, the DC-10 was awarded a type certificate from the FAA on July 29, 1971 It entered commercial service with American Airlines on August 5, 1971 on a round trip flight between Los Angeles and Chicago. United Airlines began DC-10 service on August 16, 1971.[6] The DC-10's similarity to the L-1011 in terms of passenger capacity and launch in the same timeframe resulted in a head to head sales competition which affected profitability of the aircraft.

The DC-10 had design flaws and had a poor safety record in its early years. But later, the design flaws were improved, and the DC-10 became much safer. The following accidents are some of those which have occurred since 1972.

Ocean liner is the name given to (usually large) ships that are used to transport people or goods. These ships travel along given routes; they usually have a schedule. Usually, ocean liners travel long distances. The ships used for short distances, for example across a channel, a lake, or between an island and the coast close by, are called ferries. Ocean liners are used for transportation. Cruise ships are different, they are used for pleasure. 

In the second half of the 20th century, ocean liners have been replaced by aircraft more and more.

The Simple English Wikipedia is also for people with different needs. Readers may be students, children, and adults who may find it hard to learn, and people who are trying to learn English. Other people use the Simple English Wikipedia because the simple language helps them understand difficult ideas or topics they do not know about.

When the Simple English Wikipedia began in 2003, the already had 150,000 articles, and seven other Wikipedias in other languages had over 15,000 articles. Since the other Wikipedias already have so many articles, most Simple English articles take articles from other Wikipedias and make them simple; they are usually not new articles. Right now, the Simple English Wikipedia has articles.

This makes Simple English articles a good way to understand difficult articles from the ordinary English Wikipedia. If someone cannot understand an idea in complex English, they can read the Simple English article.

Ohio State University

The Ohio State University (OSU) is a public university in Columbus, Ohio, USA. Ohio State was founded in 1870. The Ohio State University has been noted by multiple publications as one of the highest ranked universities in the United States and in the world.

The university was started in 1870 in a farming group in Columbus, Ohio. The first class had only 24 students. In 1878, it changed its name from Ohio State University to The Ohio State University, adding "The" to the front. In the 1880's, Ohio State started taking graduate students. They started the law school in 1891. Later, Ohio State added colleges of medicine, dentistry, commerce, and journalism. In 1906, Ohio made a law that said The Ohio State University was the state's "flagship campus", or the best school in the state of Ohio.

In 1916, Ohio State was the first university in Ohio to be in the Association of American Universities. Ohio State is still the only Ohio public university in the association.

"U.S. News & World Report" has ranked Ohio State University as the best public university in Ohio, one of the top 60 universities in the United States, and one of the top 20 public universities in the United States. In 2007, China's Shanghai Jiao Tong University said Ohio State was the 61st best university in the world.

The school was also ranked as the 24th best university in the US, 10th top public university, and top school in Ohio by Arizona State University. The "Washington Monthly" college rankings placed Ohio State as the 12th best in the country and 10th best public university.

Ohio State’s faculty includes a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, Kenneth G. Wilson. It has twenty-one members of the United States National Academy of Sciences or National Academy of Engineering, plus four members of the Institute of Medicine. There are also 159 elected fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science who are teaching at Ohio State. In the last 25 years, thirty-two Ohio State faculty members have been given the Guggenheim Fellowship, which is more than all other public and private Ohio universities combined.

Ohio State is using over $110 million to research important issues, such as research to find a cure for cancer, renewable energy sources, and sustainable drinking water supplies.

Undergraduate admissions to Ohio State are said to be "more selective" by "US News & World Report". It is the most selective public university in Ohio, and it is the hardest university in Ohio to get into.

About half of the people who apply to Ohio State get accepted. Of the students who get in, 57 percent graduated in the top 10 percent of their high school classes, 91 percent graduated in the top quarter, and 99% graduated in the top half. A quarter of the freshman scored in the top 3 percent of the SAT or ACT, and 72 percent scored in the top 1 percent. The average ACT score was 27. Of the 6,122 members of the 2006 freshman class, 290 had been named valedictorian (top student) of their high school's graduating class. Ohio State’s freshman class has admitted over 100 National Merit Scholars for nine of the last ten years.

Ohio State's main urban campus is in Columbus. It has a size of 1755 acres, and it is about north of the city's downtown. Four buildings are currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Enarson Hall, Hayes Hall, Ohio Stadium, and Orton Hall. Architecture on the Ohio State campus is a mix of traditional, modern, and post-modern styles.

The William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library is located at the west end of The Oval. It is the Ohio State library's main branch, and it is the largest of the school's branches. The school's library system has twenty-one libraries on its Columbus campus. There are eight other branches in other locations, and the system has fifty-five branches and collections in all.

The Wexner Center for the Arts is at the east end of The Oval. It was designed by the architects Peter Eisenman of New York and Richard Trott of Columbus, and it opened in 1989. The center was built mostly from a twenty-five million dollar gift from Ohio State graduate Leslie Wexner. Part of its design was to honor to the armory (military storage location) that was replaced with the Wexner Center. Its deconstructivist architecture makes known as one of the most important buildings of its generation, but the design makes it less than ideal to show many of the art displays. The main, permanent work kept in the center is Picasso's "Nude on a Black Armchair", a forty-five million dollar painting that Wexner gave to Ohio State.

Ohio Union is on the east side of The Oval, and at the south side is another, smaller grassy area known as the The South Oval. The west side is contains Browning Amphitheatre and Mirror Lake.

The Ohio State College of Medicine is on the southern edge of the central campus. It is home to the James Cancer Hospital, where cancer is studied. It is one of the National Cancer Institute's forty-one NCI-designated Cancer Centers.

The university also has several regional campuses and research facilities in Lima, Mansfield, Marion, and Newark. The school also has an Ohio State Agricultural Technical Institute. The first regional campus was in Newark, which was founded in 1957. Students there can get one of six bachelor degrees or two master degrees. In Lima, there are eight four-year programs, 2 high school completion programs, and four graduate programs. The Mansfield campus has is in the Allegheny Plateau area, and it has 7 bachelor programs and 3 master programs. Marion's campus is closest to Columbus, and it has 5 bachelor programs and 2 master programs.

Ohio State's research facilities include the Aeronautical/Astronautical Research Laboratory, Byrd Polar Research Center, Chadwick Arboretum, Biological Research Tower, Large Binocular Telescope, Mershon Center for International Security Studies, Stone Laboratory, and the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center.

The Office of Student Life helps students with things such as student housing; food service; health, wellness and counseling; activities, organizations and leadership development; recreation and intramurals. The Office of Student Life also operates the Schottenstein Center, the Fawcett Center, the Blackwell Inn, the Ohio Union, the Drake Union, and the Wilce Student Health Center.

Ohio State has several student-managed publications and media outlets. "The Makio" is the official yearbook."The Lantern" is the school's daily newspaper. "Mosaic" is a literary magazine published by Ohio State, which features undergraduate fiction, poetry, and art. OHIO.FM is the student-run radio station with an Internet audio stream (no broadcast signals are available in Columbus). Students also operate a local cable channel known as Buckeye TV, which airs mostly in the campus housing.

The Ohio State University Marching Band (or TBDBITL, "The Best Damn Band in the Land") is an old tradition at Ohio State. The marching band is the largest all-brass and percussion band in the world. The traditional school songs are arranged to fit this unique instrumentation. The band is famous for "Script Ohio", where band members use their bodies to spell Ohio spelled in script on the football field. It is seen as an honor to dot the "i" in the word. Celebrities such as Bob Hope, Jack Nicklaus, and John Glenn have dotted the "i".

Ohio State's main campus is known for the diversity of its students. In various surveys and rankings, it has been included among the best campuses in the nation for African Americans. "The Advocate College Guide for LGBT Students" lists Ohio State as one of the best campuses in America for LGBT students.

Ohio State offers two distinct honors programs for high ability undergraduates: Honors and Scholars. The Honors program is open to students in all majors. The Scholars program is centered around thirteen specific programs such as "Architecture Scholars", "Communication Technology Scholars", "Biological Sciences Scholars", "International Affairs Scholars", and "Politics, Society and Law Scholars". Students in the Scholars program are expected to live and take select classes with other members of the program.

At The Ohio State University, there are four recognized student governments: Undergraduate Student Government (USG), Council of Graduate Students (CGS), amd Inter-Professional Council (IPC), and Residence Hall Advisory Council (RHAC).

Ohio State is in the NCAA's Division I. Ohio State's mascot is "Brutus the Buckeye". The school colors are scarlet and gray.

Ohio State won national championships in baseball, men's basketball, football, men's swimming & diving, men's track and field, men's golf, men's gymnastics, men's fencing, men and women's fencing, and synchronized swimming.

Hulagu Khan, also known as Hulagu, Hülegü or Hulegu (Хүлэгү, "Khülegü"; Chagatai/; Arabic:هولاكو; c. 1217 – 8 February 1265), was a Mongol ruler who conquered much of Southwest Asia. Son of Tolui and the Kerait princess Sorghaghtani Beki, he was a grandson of Genghis Khan, and the brother of Arik Boke, Mongke and Kublai Khan. Hulagu's army greatly expanded the southwestern portion of the Mongol Empire, founding the Ilkhanate of Persia. Under his leadership, the Mongols destroyed the two greatest centers of Islamic power, Baghdad and Damascus, causing a shift of Islamic influence to the Mamluks in Cairo.

Niccolò and Maffeo Polo reportedly travelled to the realm of Hulagu and stayed in the city of Bukhara, in modern day Uzbekistan, where the family lived and traded for three years from 1261 to 1264.

<doc id="117076" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=117076" title="Wells Cathedral">
Wells Cathedral

Wells Cathedral is an Anglican church in Wells, Somerset, England. It is the seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells. Its building started in 1170 and the Cathedral was dedicated in 1239. 

Wells Cathedral has been described as “the most poetic of the English Cathedrals”. 
Much of the structure is in Early English architecture. Many mouldings look almost like sculptures. The carved capitals are done in a foliate style known as “stiff leaf”. This adds to their vitality. The eastern end has kept much original glass, which is rare in England. The exterior has a splendid Early English façade (~front) and a large central tower.

The first church was established on the site in 705. Construction of the present building began in the 10th century under Anglo-Saxon rule, but was later transformed under the Normans. It was largely complete at the time of its dedication in 1239. It was expanded and renovated several times since then and has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building.

Peter Price is the current Bishop of Bath and Wells; and John Clarke is the Dean.

The first church was established here in 705 AD. It was dedicated to Saint Andrew. The only remains of this first church are some excavated foundations which can be seen in the cloisters. The baptismal font in the south transept is the oldest surviving part of the cathedral which is dated to c.700 AD.

Two centuries later, the seat of the diocese was shifted to Wells from Sherborne. The first Bishop of Wells was Athelm (circa 909), who crowned King Athelstan. Athelm and his nephew Saint Dunstan both became Archbishops of Canterbury. It was also around this time that Wells Cathedral School was founded.

The present structure was begun under the direction of Bishop Reginald de Bohun, who died in 1184.
Wells Cathedral dates mainly from the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries; the nave and transept are masterpieces of Early English architecture. It was largely complete at the time of its dedication in 1239.

The bishop responsible for the construction was Jocelyn de Wells, one of the bishops at the signing of Magna Carta. Jocelyn's buildings included the Bishop's Palace, a choristers' school, a grammar school, a hospital for travellers and a chapel. He also built a manor at Wookey, near Wells. The master mason associated with Jocelyn was Elias of Dereham (died 1246). Jocelyn lived to see the church dedicated but, despite much lobbying of Rome, died in 1242. Cathedral status was granted in 1245. Masons continued with the enrichment of the West Front until about 1260.

King John was excommunicated between 1209 and 1213. During this time, work on the cathedral was suspended. In this period, building methods advanced so that bigger blocks of masonry could be moved and put into the walls. The effect of this advance can be seen on the walls of the cathedral; at a point in the building's walls, the blocks of stone increase in size.
By the time the building was finished, including the Chapter House (1306),
it already seemed too small for the developing liturgy, in particular the increasingly grand processions. A new spate of building was therefore started by Bishop John Drokensford. He heightened the central tower and began a dramatic eight-sided Lady chapel at the far east end, finished by 1326. Thomas of Whitney was the master mason.

Bishop Ralph of Shrewsbury followed. He continued the eastward extension of the quire. He also built Vicars' Close and the Vicars' Hall, to give the men of the choir a secure place to live and dine, away from the town with all its temptations.
He enjoyed an uneasy relationship with the citizens of Wells, partly because of his imposition of taxes. He surrounded his palace with crenellated walls and a moat and drawbridge. The Palace was now a castle.

The appointment of William Wynford as master mason in 1365 marked another period of activity. He was one of the foremost architects of his time and, apart from Wells, was engaged in work for the king at Windsor and at New College, Oxford University and Winchester Cathedral. Under Bishop John Harewell, he built the south-west tower of the West Front and designed the north west, which was built to match in the early 15th century. Inside the building he filled in the early English lancet windows with delicate tracery.

In the fourteenth century, the central piers (upright supports) of the crossing (where the building forms a cross) started sinking under the weight of the crossing tower. 'Scissor arches' were inserted to brace and stabilize the piers as a unit. The building was now complete, and it looked much as it does today.

Strasbourg Cathedral

Strasbourg Cathedral (official French: Notre-Dame de Strasbourg,German: Liebfrauenmünster zu Straßburg, Our Lady of Strasbourg) is the Cathedral in Strasbourg. The cathedral was built in Gothic style. The belltower is 142 m high. It was the highest building in the world from 1647 to 1874. It is currently the second-highest cathedral in France, after Rouen Cathedral, which is 9m higher, at 151m. In 1880, Cologne Cathedral was finished (157m), and later Ulm minster (at 161m), the highest Cathedral in the World. 

Considerable parts of it are still in Romanesque architecture. Nevertheless, it is widely considered to be among the finest examples of high, or late, Gothic architecture. Erwin von Steinbach is credited for major contributions from 1277 to his death in 1318.

Victor Hugo described it as a "gigantic and delicate marvel". The cathedral is visible far across the plains of Alsace and can be seen from as far off as the Vosges mountains or the Black Forest on the other side of the Rhine.

An Al-Qaeda plot to bomb the adjacent Christmas market was prevented in 2000 by French and German police.

Ely Cathedral

Ely Cathedral is an Anglican church in Ely, Cambridgeshire. It is the main church of the diocese of Ely, and the seat of the Bishop of Ely. The city of Ely is about 20 km north of Cambridge.

The Cathedral is known locally as "the Ship of the Fens", because of its prominent shape which towers above the surrounding flat landscape. The fens were once wet and marshy: a wetland habitat. The Fenland in East Anglia includes Ely, but is today mainly drained. It is now low-lying farmland.

The first Christian building on the site was founded by Etheldreda, daughter of the King of East Anglia.She set up and ruled a monastery at Ely in 673, and, when she died, a shrine was built there to her memory. 

The present cathedral was started by Abbot Simeon (1082–1094) in 1083. The Anglo-Saxon church was demolished, but some of its relics, such as the remains of its benefactors, were moved to the cathedral. The main transepts were built early on, crossing the nave below a central tower, and are the oldest surviving part of the cathedral. Construction work continued throughout the 12th century. The Western transepts and tower were completed in an exuberant Romanesque style with a rich decoration of intersecting arches and complex mouldings.

A 'Galilee' porch was added under Bishop Eustace (1198–1215) in the Early English Gothic style. It was originally a two-storey structure where liturgical processions could gather before entering the nave. It was opened up into a single vaulted space in the 18th century. Several details of its decoration, particularly the 'syncopated arches' and the use of Purbeck marble shafts, reflect the influence of St Hugh's Choir at Lincoln Cathedral, built a few years earlier.

Work began on a new eastern end in 1234, replacing the short Norman chancel with a much grander 10-bay structure. Northwold's chancel, completed by around 1252, adopted several of the stylistic elements already used in the Galilee porch.

During the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII, the monastery at Ely was dissolved in 1539. Ely suffered less than many other monasteries, but even so, statues were destroyed together with carvings and stained glass. St Etheldreda's Shrine was destroyed.

The Cathedral was refounded with a Chapter of eight canons in 1541, as was the Kings School. Robert Steward, the last Prior of the monastery, became the first Dean.

In 1986 it was discovered that the roofs, timber and stonework of much of the Cathedral were becoming unsafe. A public appeal was launched. £4,000,000 was needed to secure the Cathedral's future and to prevent its doors being closed for good. In just over a year, the money was given or promised. The Great Restoration was completed in the year 2000.

The south gallery of the nave is home to The Stained Glass Museum, a collection of stained glass from the 13th century to the present that is of national importance. It includes works from several notable modern artists.

Exeter Cathedral

Exeter Cathedral is an Anglican cathedral in the city of Exeter, Devon, in the southwest of England. It is the seat of the Bishop of Exeter. The present building was complete by about 1400, and has the longest uninterrupted vaulted ceiling in England, and other notable features. The cathedral is built in Gothic style.

In 1107, William Warelwast, a nephew of William the Conqueror, was appointed to the see, and this was the catalyst for the building of a new cathedral in the Norman style. Its official foundation was in 1133, after Warelwast's time, but it took many more years to complete. In 1258 the building was already outmoded, and it was rebuilt in the Decorated English Gothic architecture style, following the example of nearby Salisbury Cathedral. However, much of the Norman building was kept, including the two massive square towers and part of the walls. It was constructed entirely of local stone, including Purbeck Marble. The new cathedral was complete by about 1400, apart from the addition of the chapter house and chantry chapels.

On 4 May 1942, an early morning air raid took place over Exeter. The cathedral sustained a direct hit by a large high-explosive bomb on the chapel of St James, completely demolishing it. The muniment room above, three bays of the aisle and two flying buttresses were also destroyed in the blast. The medieval wooden screen opposite the chapel was smashed into many pieces by the blast, but it has been reconstructed and restored. Fortunately many of the cathedral's most important artifacts, such as the glass of the great east window, the misericords, the Exeter Book, the bishop's throne and the Bronescombe Effigy, had been removed at the start of the war in anticipation of such an attack. Subsequent repairs and the clearance of the area around the western end of the building uncovered portions of earlier structures, including remains of the Roman city and of the original Norman cathedral.

The clock is one of a group of famous 14th to 16th century astronomical clocks to be found in the West of England. Another one is at Wells Cathedral.

The main, lower, dial is the oldest part of the clock, dating from 1484. The fleur-de-lys 'hand' indicates the time (and the position of the sun in the sky) on a 24-hour analogue dial. The numbering consists of two sets of I-XII Roman numerals. The silver ball and inner dial shows both the age of the moon and its phase (using a rotating black shield to indicate the moon's phase). The upper dial, added in 1760, shows the minutes.

The Latin phrase "Pereunt et Imputantur", a favourite motto for clocks and sundials was written by the Latin poet Martial. It is usually translated as "they perish and are reckoned to our account", referring to the hours that we spend, wisely or not. The original clockwork mechanism was much modified, repaired, and neglected until it was replaced in the early 20th century. The door below the clock has a round hole near its base. This was cut in the early 17th century to allow entry for the Bishop's cat to deter vermin. The vermin were attracted to the animal fat used to lubricate the clock mechanism.

The Cathedral of Valencia (Metropolitan Basilica Cathedral) is dedicated Saint Mary. The church was started in 1238 by the first bishop of Valencia Pere d'Albalat. It was built on a mosque. The mosque had been built where the former Visigothic cathedral had stood. A Mediterranean version of Gothic architecture is the main style of this cathedral, but the cathedral also contains Romanesque, French Gothic, Renaissance art, Baroque and neoclassical elements. 

There are several chalices that are claimed to be the Holy Grail spread over the world. One of them is in a chapel of the Cathedral. Several Christian historians claim that the one in the chapel is most likely the authentic cup used at the Last Supper. It was the official papal chalice for many popes, and has been used by many others, most recently by Pope Benedict XVI, on July 9, 2006.. This chalice dates from the 1st century, and was given to the cathedral by king Alfons el Magnànim in 1436. 

The cathedral also contains examples of some of the earliest and best Quattrocento paintings of the Iberian Peninsula. These were brought from Rome via artists commissioned by the Valencian Pope Alexander VI. Alexander VI made the request to make Valencia the seat of a archbishop when he was still a cardinal. This was granted by Pope Innocent VIII in 1492.

The Holy Grail is an artifact from Christian mythology. According to a legend, it is the cup or plate used by Jesus at the Last Supper. It was later used to catch his blood when he had to die on the cross.

According to legend, it has special powers. Many stories of the Arthurian Legend are about the Holy Grail. The first to write about it was Chrétien de Troyes. The legend may combine Christian lore with a Celtic myth of a cauldron which has special powers.

The connection of Joseph of Arimathea with the Grail legend dates from Robert de Boron's "Joseph d'Arimathie" (late 12th century). In the story, Joseph receives the Grail from an apparition of Jesus and sends it with his followers to Great Britain; building upon this theme, later writers told how Joseph used the Grail to catch Christ's blood while burying him and that in Britain he founded a line of guardians to keep it safe.

A cup that could have been the Holy Grail can be seen in Valencia Cathedral.

St George's Chapel is the church at Windsor Castle in England. The chapel is governed by the Dean and Canons of Windsor and is found in the Lower Ward of the castle.

The status of the Abbey is that of a Royal Peculiar. This means it is place of worship that falls directly under the jurisdiction of the British monarch, rather than under a bishop. The concept dates from Anglo-Saxon times, when a church could ally itself with the monarch and therefore not be subject to the bishop of the area. Technically speaking, it is not a cathedral, though it has a similar status. Many Royal weddings and other ceremonies with the British Crown have taken place there.

<doc id="117136" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=117136" title="Manorialism">
Manorialism

Manorialism or Seigneurialism is the name for the organization of the economy in the Middle Ages. The economy relied mainly on agriculture. Manorialism describes the way how land was distributed and who who profited from the land.

A Lord received a piece of land, usually from a higher nobleman, or from the king. When he received the land, he also received all that was on it. That means that most of the people that lived on the land also belonged to the nobleman. The people, called peasants, had to pay to the lord, or they had to work for him. This way, the nobleman could live and support his family from what he received from the peasants. He had also certain legal powers, like that of a police force. The peasants where subjects which had to pay tribute to the lord. In return they received "protection". 

The tribute the subjects had to pay varied. it could either be that they had to do work for their lord, or that had to pay a certain part of what they earned (like "one tenth"). That meant that if they grew some form of corn, the lord got a tenth of their earnings in corn. This is also often called "payment in nature". Very rarely, it was money they had to pay.

Manors each had up to three different classes of land: 

Sometimes the lord had a mill, a bakery or a wine-press. This could be used by the peasants against a fee. Similarly, the right to hunt or to let pigs feed in his woodland was subject to a fee. The peasants could use the legal system to settle their disputes - for a fee. Single payments were due on each change of tenant. On the other side of the account, manorial administration involved significant expenses. This might be one of the reasons why smaller manors tended to rely less on villein tenure. 

Dependent holdings were held nominally by arrangement of lord and tenant, but tenure became in practice almost universally hereditary, with a payment made to the lord on each succession of another member of the family. Villein land could not be abandoned, at least until demographic and economic circumstances made flight a viable proposition; nor could they be passed to a third party without the lord's permission, and the customary payment. 

Though not free, villeins were by no means in the same position as slaves: they enjoyed legal rights, subject to local custom, and had recourse to the law, subject to court charges which were an additional source of manorial income. Sub-letting of villein holdings was common, and labour on the demesne might be commuted into an additional money payment, as happened increasingly from the 13th century. 

This description of a manor house at Chingford, Essex in England was recorded in a document for the Chapter of St Paul's Cathedral when it was granted to Robert Le Moyne in 1265:
Feudal society is based on two principles, that of feudalism and manorialism. The structures of manorialism varied though. In the later Middle Ages, areas of incomplete or non-existent manorialisation persisted while the manorial economy underwent substantial development as economic conditions changed.

Not all manors had all three kinds of land: as an average, demesne accounted for roughly a third of the arable area and villein holdings rather more; but some manors consisted solely of demesne, others solely of peasant holdings. Similarly, the proportion of unfree and free tenures could vary greatly. This meant that the amount of wage labour to perform agricultural work on the demesne varied as well. The proportion of the cultivated area in demesne tended to be greater in smaller manors, while the share of villein land was greater in large manors, providing the lord of the latter with a larger potential supply of obligatory labour for demesne work. The proportion of free tenements was generally less variable, but tended to be somewhat greater on the smaller manors. 

Manors varied also in their geographical arrangement: most did not coincide with a single village. Often, parts of two or more villages belonged to the manor, or were shared between several manors. This situation sometimes led to replacement by cash payments of the demesne labour obligations of those peasants living farthest from the lord's estate. 

The demesne was usually not a single plot of land. It consisted of some land around the central house and estate buildings. The rest of the demesne land was in the form of strips dispersed through the manor. In addition, the lord might lease free tenements belonging to neighbouring manors, as well as holding other manors some distance away to provide a greater range of produce. 

Not all manors were held by laymen lords who rendered military service or paid cash to their superior. A substantial share (estimated by value at 17% in England in 1086) belonged directly to the king, and a greater proportion (rather more than a quarter) were held by bishops and monasteries. Ecclesiastical manors were usually larger, with a significantly greater villein area than the lay manors next to them. 

The effect of circumstances on manorial economy is complex and at times contradictory: upland conditions have been seen as tending to preserve peasant freedoms (livestock husbandry in particular being less labour-intensive and therefore less demanding of villein services); on the other hand, some such areas of Europe have been said to show some of the most oppressive manorial conditions, while lowland eastern England is credited with an exceptionally large free peasantry, in part a legacy of Scandinavian settlement.

Similarly, the spread of money economy is often seen as having stimulated the replacement of labour services by money payments, but the growth of the money supply and resulting inflation after 1170 initially led nobles to take back leased estates and to re-impose labour dues as the value of fixed cash payments declined in real terms.

Today, the term is used most to refer to medieval Western Europe. A similar system was used in the rural parts of the late Roman Empire. The birthrate and population were declining. Labor was therefore the most important factor for production. Successive administrations tried to stabilise the imperial economy by freezing the social structure into place: sons were to succeed their fathers in their trade.

Councillors were forbidden to resign, and "coloni", the cultivators of land, were not to move from the demesne they were attached to. They were on their way to becoming serfs. Several factors conspired to merge the status of former slaves and former free farmers into a dependent class of such "coloni". Laws of Constantine I around 325 reinforced both the negative semi-servile status of the "coloni" and limited their rights to sue in the courts. Their numbers were augmented by barbarian "foederati" who were permitted to settle within the imperial boundaries.

As the Germanic kingdoms succeeded Roman authority in the West in the fifth century, Roman landlords were often simply replaced by Gothic or Germanic ones, with little change to the underlying situation. The process of rural self-sufficiency was given an abrupt boost in the eighth century, when normal trade in the Mediterranean Sea was disrupted. The thesis put forward by Henri Pirenne, disputed by many, supposes that the Arab conquests forced the medieval economy into even greater ruralisation and gave rise to the classic feudal pattern of varying degrees of servile peasantry underpinning a hierarchy of localised power centres.

Chris Parks

Christopher J. "Chris" Parks (born October 4, 1973), better known by his ring name Abyss, is an American professional wrestler currently working for TNA.

Abyss first appeared in Ring of Honor (ROH) in 2004, being brought in as a bodyguard to the stable Special K. Abyss appeared only once, however, due to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) pulling all of their contracted talent from ROH.
Abyss returned in the summer of 2005, this time as a member of Prince Nana's heel stable The Embassy as they feuded with Generation Next. The feud between the Embassy and Generation Next lasted through the rest of 2005 with several matches and brawls taking place between both teams. The feud culminated in a Steel Cage Warfare match at December's "Steel Cage Warfare" where Abyss teamed with Alex Shelley, Jimmy Rave and Prince Nana to take on Austin Aries, Roderick Strong, Jack Evans and Matt Sydal. Abyss was eliminated by Jack Evans after a moonsault. In the end, Generation Next won the match and the war.

In January 2006, Abyss teamed with fellow Embassy members Jimmy Rave and Alex Shelley to compete in the Trios Tournament. The Embassy won the tournament, which meant that all three of its winning members earned world title shots. However, Abyss left ROH before he could use the privilege.

Before Chris Parks was known as Abyss, he was on TNA's first show as Justice. He took part in the Gauntlet For The Gold match to determine a new NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion but lost the match.

Parks returned to TNA as "The Monster" Abyss in June 2003, debuting as a bad guy and attacking Jeff Hardy, although the feud was short lived as Hardy did not appear to their first match, resulting in a suspension. Afterwards, Parks was brought in as a bodyguard to Kid Kash. They continued to be allies until October, when Kash berated Abyss for losing a match and Abyss turned on and attacked Kash. Abyss gained a victory over Kash, but then lost a First Blood Steel Chair on a Pole match to his former partner. Soon after the loss the feud between the two ended.

Soon after, Abyss aligned himself with Don Callis. With this new alliance, Abyss soon feuded with Raven. The feud lasted for the rest of 2003, with the final match pitting Abyss and the Red Shirt Security (Kevin Northcutt and Legend) against Raven and The Gathering in a Steel Cage match. Abyss and his team came out victorious when the Gathering turned on Raven.

Going into 2004, Abyss entered his first major feud with A.J. Styles. On one show, Abyss was forced to team with Styles in a NWA World Tag Team Championship match against champions Red Shirt Security. Styles and Abyss won the titles, even when Abyss abandoned Styles near the beginning of the match. Abyss defeated Styles in a normal match the following show, and on the next gained control of the titles, defeating Styles in a Four Corners Tables match (Abyss was later stripped of the titles). The following show, both men fought to a no-contest in a Falls Count Anywhere match. The next show, Abyss defeated Styles again, this time in a Ladder match to become the top contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Abyss lost the right to Raven in a match that also involved Styles and Ron Killings.

About a month after the feud with Styles, Abyss received a new manager, Goldy Locks. She used Abyss to defeat her ex-boyfriend Erik Watts to win his contract. She kept using Abyss to win contracts for her, while also adding Alex Shelley to her group to assist. However, Goldylocks pampered Shelley and treated Abyss poorly. Watts returned for revenge, with Abyss, Shelley, and Goldylocks taking on Watts, Sonny Siaki, and Desire in a Six Person Mixed Tag Team match. During the match, Abyss turned on his team, attacking Goldylocks, and leaving the match and her for good.

Not long after separating from Goldylocks, Abyss began to feud with Monty Brown and Raven. The feud escalated into the first ever Monster's Ball match at TNA's first monthly pay per view, Victory Road. At Victory Road, Brown won the unique match when he pinned Raven. Abyss and Brown continued to feud until they met in a Serengeti Survival match at Turning Point, when Brown again came out victorious. Abyss also happened to take part in an incident at Universal Studios between TNA and World Wrestling Entertainment. 
Abyss fought in a Gauntlet For The Gold match at Hard Justice.Abyss won the match and gave himself a spot into the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary, pitting him against NWA World Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles, Monty Brown, Raven, and Sean Waltman with the NWA title on the line. Abyss lost to Raven. Abyss got a title match in a Steel Chain Dog Collar match at No Surrender. In the end, Raven pinned Abyss to retain the title.Abyss got another title match at Lockdown in a Six Sides of Steel match against Christian Cage. Christian won but Abyss took the title belt. He would not give it back unless he got another title shot. He did and he lost. Abyss got one more title shot in the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary. The match also including NWA World Champion Christian Cage, Ron Killings, Jeff Jarrett, and Sting. At the event, Jarrett won the match.
Abyss was in the Fight for the Right Tournament. Abyss won the tournament and the right to face NWA World Champion Sting at Genesis for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Abyss faced Sting at the event, and defeated Sting by disqualification.TNA rules say the title can change hands on a disqualification which made Abyss Champion.He lost the title to Christian Cage in a match also involving Sting.On the February 14 edition of "iMPACT!", Abyss was supposed to face Scott Steiner but left the ring before the match but before leaving through the tunnel, Abyss, without showing his face, took off his mask. Abyss returned to action at Slammiversary 2008 after the X Division Championship match wearing a new gray and black mask.

Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/American Eagle

Ended: 12 July, result: American Eagle promoted

Nomination by : Hello all! This is and I am nominating for adminship. To tell you the truth, I have absolutely no idea where to begin my nomination speech for American Eagle because of the massive amount of help and guidance that this user has given to the Simple English Wikipedia. This user has demonstrated extreme amounts of self-control and patience as is evident in my last RfA when both me and Djsasso went off the deep end in the Comments section. This user attempted to mediate and resolve the conflict and that is a good quality that an administrator needs to have in order to do his or her job to its fullest capacity. 

In terms of article building, this user has started and made many great articles for the Simple English Wikipedia, and he has been very helpful towards other users when they post up articles that don't quite meet the Simple English Wikipedia's expectations. He constantly works on articles that don't make the cut here to make them able to stay on this Wikipedia. Another facet of article building that this user has worked on here on the Simple English Wikipedia is getting articles ready and making articles meet the requirements for both good and very good articles. He has helped promote several articles to GA and/or VGA status already and he has done a very good job with this so far.

As always, I strive to only nominate users for adminship if and only if they help with vandalism reverting previous to the nomination. This is no exception. American Eagle has definitely helped the Simple English Wikipedia combat vandalism of all shapes and sizes, from the most dire of situations to the not very serious times and he has shown that he is capable in fighting vandalism. He has reported many a vandal onto the and he has helped fight vandalism through recent changes patrolling, as well as new changes patrolling.

American Eagle is a very helpful, friendly, and kind user who is very active on this site. He loves giving out barnstars to other editors on this site that deserve them, and he even gives out barnstars to editors that he doesn't even know! Ever since he became a member 3 months ago, his edits to the Simple English Wikipedia have all been very helpful towards having us reach our goal of being the most complete online encyclopedia. Through numerous discussions given both at and , he has proven to me and the other users that he completely understands the Simple English Wikipedia's policies and rules and I am sure that he will be a very capable administrator.

All in all, this user has been a great asset to the Simple English Wikipedia, and I can see no negative happenings coming from American Eagle if he were granted the sysop flag. I believe that by giving him the sysop flag, you are giving the whole of the Simple English Wikipedia a great administrator who will be a net positive for this site. 

Therefore, I would like to offer him up to the community as a plausible administrator. 00:06, 6 July 2008 (UTC)

Co-nomination by : Hello. I would like to present to the Simple English Wikipedia community for him to be granted the sysop rights. American Eagle has been one of our best contributers to Simple English Wikipedia I've seen in my short time here. 

American Eagle is one of our nicest and most civil editors he has shown to be. Looking through American Eagle's archives, there seems to be no major problems with this user's editing. He is one of our best article writers looking through his many articles he had created, including a few s and a which shows he wants to improve the encyclopedia. Not only is he a good article writer, over 60% of his edits are in the mainspace, which are mostly quality edits. American Eagle shows that he cares more about the quality of his edits then the quantity of them. 

American Eagle shows an understanding of our policies by how many deleted edits he has. He has almost 500 deleted edits which means he understands our and our since he does quite a lot of QB tagging. Although, I've noticed that some of his deleted edits are deleted templates that he requested for deletion himself, looking at his over 200 undeleted template 
edits, he shows he would like to make Wikipedia run better. He also does quite a lot of vandalism fighting, not to mention him reporting vandals (although a lot of our recent reports were mine ;)) to which shows he would do well with the block tool. 

Well. I think American Eagle would be one of our most worthy candidates for adminship. I believe he will not misuse the tools and that he will do just fine with them. He basically meets the also. He is sought out by others for his help and he acts in a manner consistent with our top admins. I have every confidence that he can handle the tools. Regards, () 02:38, 6 July 2008 (UTC)

Surprize Co-Nomination by : I would like to also nominate American Eagle for the SysOp flag. The reasons I want to nominate him have already been said, but just he is good fighting vandals here (and would benifit with the abillity to block and delete), and has got a few GA/VGA's. -- 03:13, 6 July 2008 (UTC)

"Candidate's acceptance:" Wow, I just got home from doing my paper route and saw this. I accept Razorflame, thanks -- 00:29, 6 July 2008 (UTC)

(More) - Hmm, I've never seen a co-nomination before, but I feel very flattered. As I said, I do accept. Regarding my deleted edits and besides them template deletions RyanCross mentioned, I have also had a few subpages deleted before. About Barnstars, I love it when new users come and I like to acknowledge them for their hard work.

Starting out on here (and before, on the English Wikipedia), I had no clue what to do, and was even three times warned for accidental vandalism (hehe). I remember trying to create a userpage over there but didn't know how to do anything. But over the last few months or so, I have learned how to do wiki-text, as well as write well (I had horrid grammar before Wikipedia came along).

Wow, if had never posted the link to a certain on the English Wikipedia, I would never started on "Simple". For I have now learned so much, and are trusted enough to be nominated for adminship. I believe I have read the policies here, and if I missed one, I think I understand what makes a Wiki, especially ours, work properly. If "elected President" (err, "nominated Sysop"), I would never abuse the tools. Again I thank you all for co-nominating me for adminship, I accept. Thanks -- 03:12, 6 July 2008 (UTC)

Mediterranean Ridge

The Mediterranean Ridge is a wide ridge in the floor of the Mediterranean Sea. It is next to a rough quarter circle from Calabria, south of Crete, to the southwest corner of Turkey, and from there eastwards south of Turkey, with Cyprus. From what tectonic theory says, it is caused by the African Plate subducting under the Eurasian and Anatolian plates. As the African Plate moves slowly north-northeastward, it plows up the floor of the Mediterranean, lifting it from the seabed, and then above sea level, making the island of Cyprus.

If the northward movement of Africa continues, the Ridge might grow into a long and high mountain range and destroy the Mediterranean Sea.

Kirby's Adventure

Kirby's Adventure, called in Japan, is a platform video game made by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System game console. It was remade for the Game Boy Advance as "".

After Kirby wakes up from his after-lunch nap without having any dreams, he goes to the Fountain of Dreams to investigate. In doing so, he discovers that King Dedede has stolen the Star Rod, the source of the Fountain of Dreams's power, and broken it into seven pieces, giving six fragments to his allies and keeping one himself. Without the Star Rod, all of the inhabitants of Dream Land are becoming restless and unable to dream. Kirby decides to track down the fragments of the Star Rod and bring them back to the Fountain of Dreams in order to restore everyones' dreams.

Kirby travels throughout seven worlds, battling enemies, mini-bosses, and bosses through treacherous terrain in order to collect all seven fragments of the Star Rod. Once Kirby defeats King Dedede and rebuilds the Star Rod, he places it back into the Fountain of Dreams. However, an ominous black aura fills the skies as a dark creature named Nightmare emerges from the fountain. It turns out that Nightmare had corrupted the Star Rod, and King Dedede removed the Star Rod, broke it, and spread it across Dream Land with the intention of protecting Dream Land. Nightmare then flies off into space, and King Dedede inhales Kirby and the Star Rod and spits them into the air. Kirby then uses the Star Rod to defeat both forms of Nightmare, and saves Dream Land once again.

"Kirby's Adventure" is a platform game. The player has to get to the end of each level by walking, jumping and flying. Each level has enemies and things that get in the way, but sometimes these things also help Kirby. If Kirby touches an enemy, he loses a health point (he has six). Sometimes Kirby meets a mini-boss, and he must beat it to go on.

Unlike the first "Kirby" game, "Kirby's Adventure" saves the game after each level. Players can go back to any level in the world that they have played by going through doors. There are seven worlds, and each world has between four and six levels, as well as a boss door and a Warp Star door. (Players can visit other worlds using Warp Stars.) Except for World 7, each world also has one or more mini-games, a place to pick up powers, and an arena where Kirby fights a mini-boss.

Kirby can do four things: Walk, jump, fly and inhale. Kirby can go as high as he wants as long as nothing blocks him, and he can fall back to the ground by exhaling. The puff of air can hurt enemies and break blocks.

Kirby can also inhale enemies and other things. He eats any food that he inhales, but enemies and other things remain in his mouth. He can either spit them back out and send them flying (hurting or destroying anything in their path), or he can swallow them. He also has a sliding move where he can kick enemies and blocks.

When Kirby swallows an enemy, he "copies" that enemy's power. "Kirby's Adventure" is the first game in the series to do this, and Kirby has a lot of powers he can use. Once he has a special power, he can use it to fight enemies and solve puzzles. One example of a puzzle is where Kirby uses the Fire ability to light a cannon.

An official soundtrack was released in Japan on July 21, 1994 by Sony. The vocalist was Mako Miyata.

In 2002, a remake of Kirby's Adventure titled Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land was released for the Game Boy Advance. The new version has, in addition to new visuals and sound, different minigames, a multiplayer mode, and other new features. However, it also had some criticism for the omission of certain materials that pushed the NES to its limit, and replaced by what is often considered lazy for the Game Boy Advance. For instance, the rotating pseudo-3D towers in Butter Building were removed. In addition, the difficulty is significantly lower.

A demo of Kirby's Adventure is available in Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii console.

<doc id="117256" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=117256" title="Ned Kelly">
Ned Kelly

Edward "Ned" Kelly (June 1855 11 November 1880) is Australia's most famous bushranger. He has become a symbolic figure in Australian history, folklore, books, art and film. As a national icon, his image was used during the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. He is remembered in the saying "... as game as Ned Kelly"; the word "game" in this case meaning "brave".

While he was growing up, his family was often in trouble with the police. After fighting a policeman at his home in 1878, Kelly went to the bush to hide. He murdered three policemen who were searching for him. The government made Ned, his brother, and two friends outlaws. They became known as the Kelly Gang. Kelly led the gang to rob a number of banks, and even capture a whole town. A final violent fight with police took place at Glenrowan. Kelly, dressed in home-made metal armour and helmet, was captured and sent to trial. Found guilty of murder, he was hanged at the Melbourne Gaol in 1880. 

A painting of Kelly by Australian artist Sidney Nolan was sold in 2010 for AU$5.4 million, the highest price ever paid for an Australian painting.

Edward 'Ned' Kelly was born in Beveridge, north of Melbourne, in June 1855. The actual date is not known because the birth was not registered on the government list of births, deaths and marriages in Victoria. His prison records give the date as 1856. He was the son of Irish Catholic parents, John "Red" Kelly and Ellen Quinn. Red Kelly had been a convict who had been sent to Van Diemen's Land in 1842 for stealing two pigs. He moved to Victoria in 1848. He met Ellen Quinn, who had come to Victoria from Ireland with her family in 1841. Red started working for Ellen's father, James Quinn, who was a farmer at Beveridge. Ned was probably born at his grandfather's house. Around 1860, Red built a small house for his family, which is still standing in Kelly Street.

When Ned was about nine, Red moved the family north to a new farm at Avenel. Ned saved a young boy, Richard Shelton, from drowning in Hughes Creek. The Shelton family, who owned the Royal Mail Hotel, gave Ned a sash made from green silk for his bravery. The sash was long and wide. He was wearing this sash under his armour when he was captured at Glenrowan. The sash, still covered in Ned Kelly's blood, is now kept in the Benalla Museum. Red was not a successful farmer and was soon arrested for stealing cattle. In May 1866, he was given one month in prison and had to pay a fine of £25. Red died on 27 December 1866, and is buried in the Avenel Cemetery.

Ellen Kelly moved the family to Greta. There were other members of Ellen's family living in the area. Her father, James Quinn, had moved from Beveridge to a large farm, called Glenmore, on the King River in north east Victoria. Her sisters, Catherine and Jane, and their ten children, were farming at Greta. Their husbands, brothers John and Thomas Lloyd, were in prison for stealing cattle. When Ellen came to Greta, her brothers, James, William and John Quinn, moved from Glenmore to help the sisters and their families. Some of the Quinn family had also been sent to prison for cattle stealing. James, Ellen's brother, had been charged ten times for cattle stealing. In 1868, Red Kelly's brother, James Kelly, came to visit Ellen. He got drunk and after an argument with the sisters, tried to burn their house down. He was given the death penalty, but this was later changed to 15 years in prison. The police thought the whole family were trouble makers and criminal.

Ellen Kelly and her children moved to a farm on the Eleven Mile Creek, between Greta and Glenrowan. Ned Kelly started work cutting down trees, breaking in horses, herding cattle and putting up fences.

On 14 October 1869, 14-year-old Ned was arrested for stealing money from a Chinese man. Kelly spent ten days in the police station lockup but there was not enough proof to send Ned to court and he had to be set free. Ned also worked in the bush with an ex-convict Harry Power. 

Power had escaped from a Melbourne gaol and started bushranging. Kelly was arrested in May 1870 for helping Power to rob people. He was kept in the gaol at Kyneton for seven weeks. Soon after this Ned was in trouble again. With his uncle, Jack Lloyd, Ned had got into a fight with a hawker (a traveling salesman). They then sent a rude letter and some calf's testicles to the hawker's wife. In October 1870 he was sent to Beechworth gaol for assault and for being rude to a lady. He spent five months in gaol.

Just three weeks after getting out of gaol in April 1871, 16-year-old Ned was arrested again. He had ridden a friend's horse into Greta. He did not know that his friend, Isaiah "Wild Wright", had stolen the horse from the Mansfield post office. There was a fight when a policeman, Constable Hall, tried to arrest him. Hall tried to shoot Kelly three times, but his gun would not work, and so he hit him over the head with it instead. Kelly was sent to Pentridge Gaol in Melbourne. After four months he was moved to the prison ship, "Sacramento", at Williamstown. Prison ships were old ships that were used as extra prison space. Prisoners from the "Sacremento" worked during the day building a sea wall at Williamstown beach. They also worked on building a fort for the guns that were protecting Port Phillip Bay. Kelly was released from prison on 2 February 1874. 

In August Kelly met his friend "Wild Wright" in Beechworth. He must have been angry with Wright because of the stolen horse which had put him in prison. Behind the Imperial Hotel they fought a bare knuckle boxing match that lasted for 20 rounds. Wright said later that "...he gave me the hiding of my life." In September 1877, Kelly was arrested in Benalla, for being drunk, riding on a footpath and resisting arrest. Kelly escaped from the police while they were taking him to the courthouse. After a fight with the police he ran across the road into a boot shop and locked the door. Kelly gave himself up when the judge came over to the shop. One of the policemen involved in the fight to arrest Kelly was Thomas Lonigan. Lonigan was later shot dead by Kelly at Stringybark Creek.

Constable Fitzpatrick was in charge of the small police station at Greta. Because of the Kelly family's long history of criminal activity, Police Superintendent C. H. Nicholson had given orders that the police were not to go to the Kelly's house alone. But Fitzpatrick decided he would 'fix the Greta mob'. In April 1878, he went to the house to arrest Ned's brother, Dan Kelly for horse stealing. Dan had only been recently let out of prison. Fitzpatrick was probably drunk, as he had stopped at the Winton hotel to drink brandy. Dan Kelly refused to go back to the police station with Fitzpatrick, because the policeman did not have a warrant, the official document needed make an arrest. Fitzpatrick then tried to make Kate, Ned's 15-year-old sister, sit on his knee so he could kiss her. This started a fight with members of the family and Fitzpatrick hurt his wrist. He and Ellen, Kate's mother, agreed to forget what had happened. But when Fitzpatrick went back to the Benalla police station he said Ned had shot at him three times and Ellen Kelly had hit him on the head with a shovel. Fitzpatrick lost his job with the police in 1881 after the head of the police force said he was a "liar". 

A group of police led by Sergeant Steele went back to Greta, and arrested Ellen Kelly (with her baby Alice King), her son-in-law William Skillion, and a neighbour, William "Bricky" Williamson, for the attempted murder of Constable Fitzpatrick. Ned and Dan Kelly were not at the house and could not be arrested. Ellen Kelly said that Ned was not involved, and that he was working away. After a trial in Beechworth, Ellen Kelly was sentenced by Judge Redmond Barry to three years in prison for trying to kill Constable Fitzpatrick. Skillion and Williamson were given six years in prison. The police offered a reward of £100 for the capture of the Kelly brothers. In 1881 Williamson was let out of prison and given a full pardon because the government knew that he was innocent.

Ned and Dan Kelly went into hiding in the bush. They were later joined by two friends, Joe Byrne and Steve Hart. On 25 October 1878, two groups of police set out to find the Kellys. They knew the two brothers were hiding in the Wombat Ranges, a mountain range between Greta and Mansfield. One group started south from Greta led by Senior Constable Strahan. Strahan said he would shoot the Kellys down like dogs. A second group led by Sergeant Michael Kennedy set off from Mansfield heading north. Three other policemen were with him: Constables Thomas McIntyre, Thomas Lonigan, and Michael Scanlon. They set up a camp at Stringybark Creek in a thick forest area.

Kennedy and Scanlon went searching for the Kellys, while Lonigan and McIntyre remained at the camp. The Kellys were living in a hut nearby at Bullock Creek. They heard noises and discovered the police camp. They decided to capture the policemen and take their guns and horses. Ned and Dan went to the police camp and told them to surrender. Constable McIntyre put his arms up, but Lonigan got out his gun. Ned Kelly shot him dead. When the other two police returned to camp, McIntyre told them to surrender. When Scanlon went for his gun Kelly also shot him dead. Kennedy ran shooting from tree to tree with Kelly chasing him. Kelly shot him twice, in the armpit and in the chest. Kelly later said that Kennedy "...appeared to be suffering very much and in great agony...I did not wish to leave him alone to linger out in such pain.". Ned put his gun against Kennedy's chest and shot him again. Ned Kelly went back to the camp to get Kennedy's cloak which he then placed over the body. McIntyre escaped during the confusion and went back to Mansfield to tell everyone what had happened.

The Victorian government passed a law on 30 October 1878, to make the Kelly gang outlaws. This meant they no longer had any legal rights and could be shot by anyone. Anyone who could capture any member of the gang, alive or dead, would be paid a reward of £500, or £2,000 for all four men. At this time the police did not know that Hart and Byrne were members of the gang. The gang were seen at several places around north east Victoria. They tried to cross the Murray River to go into New South Wales, but the water was too deep. The police had several large groups hunting for them.

On 10 December 1878, the gang robbed the Australian National Bank at Euroa. They had stopped at Faithful Creek station (a farm) and held the people there prisoners. They locked 22 people including farm workers, hawkers (traveling salesmen) and visitors into a storeroom. Joe Byrne kept guard while the rest of the gang went into Euroa. They went to the bank and said they had a message from McCauley, the farm manager. They got into the bank and held up the bank's manager Robert Scott, along with two tellers (bank workers). After taking all the money, the gang forced Scott, his wife, family, maids and tellers to go with them back to Faithful Creek. They were locked up with the other hostages.

The outlaws gave a display of horse riding and tricks which entertained and surprised their hostages. After having supper, and telling the people not to leave the farm for another three hours, the gang left. The crime was carried out without injury and the gang stole £2,000.

The police increased the reward on the Kelly Gang. More police were sent to guard banks in the country. Friends of the Kellys were locked in gaol. The gang crossed the Murray River and rode north into New South Wales. They arrived in Jerilderie on Saturday 8 February 1879. They broke into the local police station and locked the two policemen, Richards and Devine, in the police cells. The outlaws put on police uniforms and mixed with the local people. They said that they were extra police from Sydney, who had come to guard the town from the Kelly gang. Ned Kelly took his horse to the blacksmith to get new horseshoes and told the man to send the bill to the New South Wales police force. On Monday the gang rounded up various people and forced them into the back room of the Royal Mail Hotel. While Dan Kelly and Steve Hart kept the hostages busy with "drinks on the house" (free drinks), Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne went to the telegraph office and cut down some of the poles and cut the wires. They then went and robbed the local bank of about £2,414. Kelly also burned all the townspeople's mortgage deeds in the bank. When the gang left the town they were singing about two earlier bushrangers, Ben Hall and Dan Morgan: "Hurrah for the good old times of Morgan and Ben Hall."

For the next 18 months the police were not able to find the Kelly gang. They punished anyone they thought might be helping the gang. More than 20 people were locked up in the Beechworth Prison for three months only because they were said to be friends of the gang. None of these people were ever charged with a crime. The government thought the Kelly gang might try and free their friends, so they put up large iron gates on the entrance to the prison.

Months before going to Jerilderie, and with help from Joe Byrne, Ned Kelly dictated a long letter (56 pages). The letter told his story, about how he became a bushranger, and the treatment of his family by the police. It also told the story of the treatment of Irish Catholics by the police and the English and Irish Protestant farmers. He even said there might be a revolution by people in north east Victoria to set up their own republic.

The "", as it is called, is a document of about 8,300 words and has become a famous piece of Australian literature. Kelly had written an earlier letter on 14 December 1878, to Donald Cameron, a member of the Parliament of Victoria, but it had been ignored. The Jerilderie Letter was never published. Kelly tried to find the editor of the local newspaper and get him to print the letter. He finally gave the letter to Edward Living, a teller at the bank. Living kept the letter, which was not re-discovered until 1930. It was then published by the "Melbourne Herald". The handwritten letter was given to the State Library of Victoria in 2000. Kelly's words are colorful, rough and full of metaphors. He said the police were "... big ugly fat-necked wombat headed big bellied magpie legged narrow hipped splay footed sons of Irish bailiffs or English landlords ...".

The gang decided that Aaron Sherritt, Joe Byrne's best friend, was a police spy. On the night of 26 June 1880, Dan Kelly and Joe Byrne went to Sherritt's house in the Woolshed Valley near Beechworth and killed him. The four policemen who were protecting him at the time hid under the bed and did not report the murder until the next day. The outlaws knew that the police would send extra men to Beechworth by train to try and capture them. Ned Kelly and Hart arrived in Glenrowan on 27 June, and took 70 hostages at the Glenrowan Inn (hotel). They knew that a train loaded with police was on its way. They forced railway workers at Glenrowan to pull up the rail tracks to make the train crash. The bushrangers, wearing homemade armour, would then capture any of the policemen that were alive after the crash. With the police out of the way, the Kelly Gang would then go into Benalla and rob the bank. The captured police would be released when Ellen Kelly, William Williamson, and William Skillion, were let out of gaol. 

But the plan to derail the police train failed. The police protecting Aaron Sherritt were too scared to leave his hut and the murder was not reported until the next day. The Kellys had to wait 24 hours longer for the police train than they had planned. The hostages were becoming difficult to control. To keep them amused the outlaws held a dance in the hotel, where Kelly danced a quadrille with Jane Jones, daughter of the hotel owner. They also had sporting events including the hop, step and jump. Kelly used two revolvers as extra weights while taking part in the jumping. A local school teacher, Thomas Curnow, talked Ned into letting him take his family home. As soon as he was free Curnow went down to the railway line, waving a lantern (light) wrapped in his red scarf. The train stopped safely. 

The 46 police quickly left the train and placed themselves around the hotel so that the Kelly Gang was trapped inside. The gang members put on their armour, made from plough parts. All four had helmets. Each man's armour was quite heavy; Ned's armour weighed , which was about half his body weight. The police fired their guns into the building for seven hours. It is estimated that 15,000 bullets were fired during the shooting. The police ordered a cannon from Melbourne so that they could destroy the inn, but it would take too long to arrive so they set fire to the building instead.

At dawn on Monday 28 June, Ned Kelly came out of the inn wearing his armour. He marched towards the police, firing his gun at them. Their bullets bounced off his armour. He was shot in his legs that armour did not cover. Joe Byrne died in the front room from loss of blood because a gunshot cut his femoral artery. Dan Kelly and Steve Hart may have killed themselves as their bodies were found lying side by side in a back room with their heads on blankets. They had taken off their armour and it was found next to them. Several hostages were shot, and three died, including 13-year-old Jack Jones, the son of the hotel owner. Martin Cherry, a railway worker, was rescued from the burning hotel but died soon afterwards. George Metcalfe, a quarry worker, who was forced to pull up the railway line died later from injuries. The police had one small injury; the police Superintendent, Francis Hare, received a wound to his wrist, then fled the battle. The Royal Commission set up to examine the Kelly Gang later removed Hare from the Victoria Police.

Ned Kelly was taken to the Melbourne Gaol where he was treated for his wounds. He was visited by his mother who was in the same prison for wounding Constable Fitzpatrick. In August he was taken back to Beechworth by train for the first court hearings. The court agreed that Kelly would be tried in court for the murder of Thomas Lonigan and Michael Scanlon at Stringybark Creek. The government thought people around Beechworth might not find Kelly guilty of the crimes, and so they had the trial moved to Melbourne. At the trial the jury found Kelly guilty of both murders. He was sentenced to death by the Irish-born judge Sir Redmond Barry with the words "May God have mercy on your soul". Kelly said "I will go a little further than that, and say I will see you there when I go". 

Many people did not think Kelly should die after all on what has happened. A petition with more than 60,000 names asked for mercy. He was hanged on 11 November 1880, at the Melbourne Gaol for murder. Several newspapers including "The Age" and "The Herald" reported Kelly's last words as "Such is life". Sir Redmond Barry died after a short illness on 23 November, 1880, 12 days after Kelly.

Ned Kelly was buried in an unmarked grave at the Melbourne Gaol, in an area with other criminals who had also been hung at the gaol. The bones of 32 people were dug up in 1929 when the gaol was being redeveloped, and reburied at Pentridge Gaol in Coburg, Victoria. The burial site at Pentridge was rediscovered in 2008. DNA testing has proved that one set of bones was the skeleton of Ned Kelly. Experts from the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine said that the DNA clearly matches one of Kelly's living relatives. The bones show some of the injuries Kelly got during the shoot out with the police. The Kelly skeleton does not have a skull.

A skull, said to be Kelly's, was found during the digging at the gaol in 1929. It was put on display at the Old Melbourne Gaol, but it was stolen in 1978. On the anniversary of Ned Kelly's hanging, 11 November 2009, a farmer from Western Australia gave a skull back to Heritage Victoria which he said had been taken from the gaol. It was tested for DNA to see if it was Ned Kelly's skull. These tests showed it was not, and the location of Kelly's skull is still unknown.

Ned Kelly is still a major part of Australian popular culture. His story has been told in books, movies, plays and television shows. His image has been used for everything from cakes to tattoos. A recent study showed that people with a Ned Kelly tattoo were eight times more likely to be murdered. In 1980, the Australian Post Office released a set of postage stamps to remember the 100th anniversary of the siege at Glenrowan. In 2010 the National Gallery of Victoria paid AU$2.2 million for a painting of Ned Kelly by artist Sidney Nolan. It was Nolan's paintings of Ned Kelly that inspired the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. In June 2011 the Williamstown Australian Rules Football Club claimed that Ned Kelly had played 11 games for the club in 1873 while serving time in the prison ship. It was also claimed that in 1928 they had found a suit of armour buried on the football ground.

Ben Hall

Ben Hall (May 9, 1837 – May 5, 1865) was an Australian bushranger. A bushranger is a thief who roamed the countryside and country towns of Australia, usually escaping on horseback, like a highwayman. Most bushrangers were simply criminals and thieves. Ben Hall is one of the few bushrangers, like Ned Kelly, who were thought of as outlaw heroes. 

Ben Hall lived at a time when gold had been discovered in New South Wales and Victoria. Thousands of people went out to the places where gold had been discovered to "seek their fortunes" and hoping to get rich. Like many bushrangers, Ben Hall and his gang robbed coaches that were carrying gold from the goldfields. Ben Hall was able to avoid being arrested by the police for many years because he had many friends and relatives to help him. 

In folklore, a typical outlaw hero is a farmer or other innocent person who is forced into crime by cruel police or government actions. Ben Hall is part of a long history of outlaw heroes that includes people like Robin Hood in England and Jesse James in the United States. The outlaw hero is said to be a friend of the poor, kind to women and children, and an enemy of the rich. He is said to have died bravely in a battle against the more powerful forces of the law. Ben Hall has been seen by people in Australia as such a hero; others see him as a very clever criminal who stole a lot of money. 

Ben Hall was born on May 9, 1837, at Wallis Plains, near Maitland, in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. His parents were Benjamin Hall (born in Bristol, England, 1802) and Eliza Somers (born in Dublin, Ireland, 1807). Both of his parents were convicts and sent to gaol in New South Wales. They married in 1834. Ben was their fourth child. After they were let out of gaol, they moved to the Hunter Valley. Benjamin worked for Samuel Clift on a farm called the "Doona Run". Around 1839, Benjamin moved to a valley, north of Murrurundi. He built a hut and began farming cattle. He also found wild cattle and horses in the nearby hills. In 1842, he bought a small block of land at Haydonton, near Murrurundi, and started a butcher shop. The family worked hard, but there were problems with the police over stolen cattle and horses. Near the end of 1850, Benjamin moved down to the Lachlan River area, taking his children, Ben, William, and Mary, and his stepson, Thomas Wade.

After his father died in 1851, Ben worked on many cattle farms along the Lachlan River. He was known as a hard-working and honest stockman.
On February 29, 1856, at the age of 19, Hall married Bridget Walsh (1841–1923), a farmer's daughter, at Bathurst. On August 7, 1859, they had a son, whom they named Henry. One of Bridget's sisters was the mistress (lover) of bushranger Frank Gardiner; another sister married John Maguire. In 1860, Ben Hall and John Maguire leased the "Sandy Creek" farm of about south of Forbes. Hall built a house, sheds and stockyards. He raised cattle that he sold at the Lambing Flat goldfield. He met Frank Gardiner who had a butchers shop at Lambing Flat.

Historians are unsure why, but Hall's life changed. By early 1862, his marriage was in trouble. Biddy left Ben and moved in with a neighbour, Jim Taylor, taking young Henry with her. There were many criminals living and working in the area where Hall lived. He became friends with Frank Gardiner. Gardiner was already wanted for robbery and had shot two policemen before escaping. On April 14, 1862 Gardiner and Hall robbed three bullock wagon drivers. One week later the drivers saw him at the Forbes horse races. Police Inspector Sir Frederick Pottinger, who was also at the races, told the police to arrest Ben for using guns in a robbery with Gardiner. The jury at the courthouse at Orange did not think there was enough evidence to show that Hall had been one of the robbers. After he was released, the police kept a close watch on Ben Hall, to see where he went and what he was doing. 

On 15 June, 1862, Gardiner and a group of ten men, including Hall, robbed the Forbes gold coach near Eugowra. This coach carrying gold from the gold fields had an escort of police escort to guard it. The gang stole more than £14,000 in gold and money. This is about US$4 million in 2003 money value. This was Australia's biggest gold robbery. Hall and several others were arrested in July. Once again the police were unable find proof that Hall was one of the robbers. The police let him go at the end of August. When Hall went back to his farm he found his house burned down. His cattle had been left in the stockyards and had died from starvation (not having enough to eat). There are claims that this was done by Pottinger to punish Hall, but not all historians agree. Hall and John Maguire needed money to pay their legal costs. They were forced to sell the lease of their farm at "Sandy Creek" to a Forbes hotel owner called John Wilson. 

With his wife, young son, and his farm gone, Ben Hall slowly moved into a life of crime as a bushranger. On March 1, 1863, Hall and bushrangers Patrick Daley (Patsy) and John O'Meally, were nearly captured in the Weddin mountains by Police Inspector Norton and black tracker Billy Dargin. Black trackers were aboriginals used by the police for their skills in following people in the bush. After shooting at each other, Norton was captured and robbed. Dargin managed to escape into the bush. Hall and Daley chased Dargin through the bush for . When they caught him they told him they admired his bravery. They let him go, but told him they would rob the police camp that night. While the police were out looking for them, the gang stole guns and ammunition from the police camp. The police chased them but the gang had stolen better and faster horses and easily escaped.

Frank Gardiner went to Queensland to hide from the police after the Eugowra robbery. Hall took over as leader of the gang. For three years Hall carried out well-planned and daring crimes. They robbed mainly farmhouses, stagecoaches carrying mail and gold, and country hotels. Hall's gang included John Gilbert as his lieutenant, his main helper. In 1863 the other three members were John O'Meally, John Vane and Michael Burke. Burke was only 17 years old. He was shot and killed on October 24, 1863, during a robbery at Henry Keightley's house at Dunn's Plains. Vane wanted to shoot Keightley for killing Burke, but Ben Hall stopped him. Instead he asked for a £500 ransom. Mrs Keightley had to ride to Bathurst at night to get the money from the bank. A few weeks later on November 19, O'Meally was shot and killed during an attempted robbery on Goimbla Station (farm). Vane gave himself up and was sent to gaol. Two other men, James Mount (called "The Old Man") and John Dunleavy, joined the gang but were soon captured. In May 1864, Hall and Gilbert were joined by John Dunn.

The police seemed powerless to stop the Ben Hall gang. The gang were very busy in the district during 1864. For example:

Hall's gang robbed Robinson's Hotel in Canowindra and held all the people of the town hostage for three days. Nobody was hurt and Hall even got the people to play music and dance. The local policeman was locked in his own cell. When the people were set free, Hall paid them money. The gang paid the hotel owner for the food and drink that they had used. The capture of the town is made famous in a song called "John Gilbert".

The gang was regularly robbing people and holding up the mail coaches, south of Goulburn on the main Sydney to Melbourne Road. On November 15, 1864, the gang tried to rob the Gundagai-Yass mail coach near Jugiong. While waiting for the coach, the gang captured and robbed over 60 people, who were traveling along the road. One of those captured was a policeman, James McLaughlin. He fired six shots at the gang, but did not have any more ammunition and gave himself up. The policeman on the coach, William Roche, was ordered by Police Magistrate Alfred Rose, who was riding inside, not to shoot and draw fire. The driver, Bill Geoghegan, ordered him to get off the coach or he would kick him off. Hall and Dunn began firing at two other policemen who were riding behind the coach. Sub-Inspector William O'Neill was quickly captured. John Gilbert and Sergeant Edmund Parry were shooting at each other from a close distance. Gilbert shot dead Sergeant Parry. Constable Roche escaped into the bush. The gang quickly took all the money and valuable items and rode away. Parry is buried at Gundagai. On his headstone it says ""Edmund Parry, Sergeant of the N.S.W. Police, who lost his life in the execution (doing) of his duty whilst courageously (bravely) endeavouring (trying) to capture the bushranger Gilbert by whom he was shot dead near Jugiong."" Two days later the gang robbed the mail coach between Yass and Lambing Flat. On December 5, they robbed the mail coach between Binalong and Burrowa.

On Boxing Day, 1864, Hall, John Gilbert, and John Dunn, rode into the town of Binda with three local girls. The girls were Christina McKinnon aged 25, believed to be Hall's lover, Ellen Monks aged 17, and her sister Margaret Monks, aged 19. Together with the girls the gang robbed a shop owned by Edward Morriss. They locked all the local people into the Flag Hotel. They made everyone dance to celebrate Boxing Day. Morriss got out of the hotel through a back window at 2.00 a.m. and set off to tell the police. Gilbert fired several shots at him. Hall got angry and so he set fire to Morriss's shop and burned it down. The gang and the girls left the town. Christina McKinnon and Ellen Monks were arrested for helping the bushrangers and were sent to Sydney for trial. Morriss joined the police force.

The police were under a lot of pressure to catch the Ben Hall gang. The gang had been able to travel around the country and go anywhere they liked. They made the police look like fools. Sir Frederick Pottinger came up with an unusual plan. He knew the gang liked race horses and horse racing; they had been seen at many country race meetings. Pottinger planned to ride in the races at Wowingragong, near Forbes, on January 5, 1865. He thought this would bring the gang out into the open where his men would be able to capture them. The Ben Hall gang did not appear, and Pottinger lost his job. The Inspector-General of Police thought that Pottinger had disgraced the police force by riding in races while he was supposed to be working. Pottinger decided to go to Sydney to make the police force change its mind, but on the way he accidentally shot himself and died.

On January 26, 1865, the gang held up ten people on the road near Goulburn. They were chased into the bush by a group of policemen. A couple of hours later the gang rode into the town of Collector. Hall and Gilbert robbed the Commercial Hotel. John Dunn stayed outside. When the local policeman, Constable Nelson, arrived, Dunn shot him dead at close range. One of Nelson's nine children saw the shooting. Gilbert robbed Nelson's body of money and other valuables and took his gun. They left the town quickly and went into hiding. 

The police put more effort into the hunt for the bushrangers. In February they went to a house near Queanbeyan and found the gang had only just left. The police thought that the gang might be with a friend, Thomas Byrne. They went to the Breadalbane Hotel and arrested four men that were known to be friends of the gang. This would stop them giving the bushrangers any warnings. The police surrounded Byrne's farm. As they moved passed the open door of the barn, the bushrangers began shooting. One policeman, Wiles, was shot in the hand and the leg. The bushrangers escaped into the bush, but Ben Hall was shot as he ran away.

On March 4, 1865, the gang robbed the mail coach at between Goulburn and Gundaroo. A couple of days later they stole horses from two farms. On March 13, the gang tried to hold up the Araluen gold coach. Gold had been found at Araluen in the 1860's. The gold coach had a policeman with a gun sitting next to the driver. There were two more policemen on the back of the carriage. Four more policemen rode on horses in front and behind the coach. The gold was kept in a safe which was bolted to floor of the coach. (The coach has survived and is being restored). The bushrangers began shooting at the coach. Constable Kelly was shot in the chest. He was badly hurt, but he crawled to side of the road and began shooting at the bushrangers. The police were able to keep the bushrangers away from the coach. Another policeman, Trooper Byrne, was shot in the foot. The bushrangers quickly left when miners with guns arrived from the town.

In two years Ben Hall's gang, as well as killing two policemen, had reportedly robbed 10 mail coaches, held up 21 properties, stole 23 racing horses, and taken over the village of Canowindra three times.

In early 1865, the government made a new law to help capture Ben Hall, John Gilbert and John Dunn. The "Felons Apprehension Act" was rushed quickly through the New South Wales Parliament. They made Hall and his friends "outlaws". This meant that they could be killed by anyone at any time without warning. They also put a reward of £1000 for the capture of Ben Hall.

The bushrangers still kept busy robbing people. They robbed a farm, Wallendbeen Station, and wanted to know where the police were. A group of Chinese gold miners were robbed and one was shot in the leg by Gilbert. The next day, March 18, the police found the gang trying to take horses from Wallendbeen. In the shooting, Gilbert shot Senior Constable Keane in the shoulder. Sergeant Murphy shot Gilbert in the arm. The gang escaped into the bush. They made their way to a shepherd's hut and forced the shepherd to put a bandage on Gilbert's arm. Hall and Dunn walked to a nearby farm, Beggan Beggan station. They held up the 16 farm workers and took horses, saddles and bridles. They went back to get Gilbert and then robbed the farm again, taking guns, ammunition, and food.

Hall, Gilbert and Dunn robbed the bank in Forbes and took £81 on March 25. More police were sent to the area, and they were given better guns. A month later the gang were seen near Marengo. Two days later they took horses and food from another farm, Yamma station. This was the gang's last robbery.

By May 1865, Ben Hall decided to leave New South Wales. But a man, Goobang Mick, who had once given the gang help, told the police where Hall was hiding. During the night a group of eight policemen found Hall sleeping under a tree at Billabong Creek, near Forbes. The police were armed with double-barrelled shotguns and .56 calibre Colt rifles. Led by sub-Inspector Davidson the police placed themselves in a large circle around Ben Hall. When he woke up at dawn on 5 May, 1865, Hall was shot in the back 30 times as he tried to run away. A newspaper report said his body was "riddled" with bullets. He did not shoot his pistol once. The first rifle shots of the police cut his belt in two, and his guns fell to the ground. Goobang Mick was given a £500 reward. The police were given another £500 reward.
Ben Hall's body was put in a sack, tied to a horse and taken back to Forbes. An official inquest was held in the court house to find out how he died. Ben Hall was in Forbes Cemetery on Sunday, May 7, 1865.A lot of people went to see him buried. The first wooden grave marker and fence were burnt in a bushfire. Two brothers from Forbes, the Pengilly brothers, put a headstone on the grave in the 1920s. The tree that Hall slept under before he was shot dead became an attraction. People in the 1920's were still able to see bullets in the tree trunk. The tree was destroyed in a bushfire in 1926. His grave is well looked after and many people still come to look at it. Ben Hall's gun, a Colt pistol is now in the National Library of Australia.

Gilbert and Dunn were nearly caught by the police a week later at Binalong. Gilbert was shot dead as he tried to run away. Dunn got away, but six months later a friend told the police where Dunn was hiding. He was captured, tried for murder and hanged in Sydney on March 19, 1866.

In 2007, Peter Bradley, a descendant of Hall's younger brother Henry, said he wanted to reopen the inquest into the bushranger's death. Bradley said that the "Felon Apprehension Act" was not yet law when Hall was killed. The first inquest found that Hall was deliberately killed, but this was allowed because the new law meant Hall was an outlaw. The parliament had passed the law on April 12, but it did not become law until May 10. This was 5 days after Hall was shot to death by police.

There is memorial called "Ben Hall's Wall" at Breeza, south of Gunnedah, New South Wales. "Ben Halls Gap National Park" is a small section of State Forest south of Nundle, New South Wales. It is not named after the bushranger, but after his father, Benjamin Hall.

Many folk songs celebrate Hall's life and actions. These include:


The story of Hall has been shown in many works of art.

Hall's story has also been told on the stage:

Azrael (angel of death) is the archangel of death. It is an English form of the Arabic name Azra'il or Azra'eil (عزرایل), the name traditionally attributed to the angel of death in Islam and some Hebrew lore. The Qur'an never uses this name, referring instead to Malaikat al-Maut (which translates directly as angels of death; not one angel). Since it is not mentioned either in the Qur'an nor Hadith, it is not part of the religion. It is thought by some to be legendary or adapted from other religions. It is also spelled Izrail, Izrael, Azrail, Ezraeil, Azraille, or Ozryel. Chambers English dictionary uses the spelling Azrael. The name literally means "Whom God Helps."

She won nine Grand Slam singles titles, winning eight of them while a citizen of Yugoslavia and one while a citizen of the United States.

She was the dominant player in the women's game during 1991 and 1992, but in 1993, she was forced out of the sport for two years following an on-court attack in which a spectator stabbed her in the back with a knife. She enjoyed some success after returning to the tour in 1995, including a singles title at the Australian Open in 1996, but was unable to consistently reproduce her very best form.

Seles played her last professional match at the 2003 French Open, but her official retirement announcement was not issued until February 2008.

Syed Ahmed Khan

Sir Syed Ahmed Khan Bahadur, GCSI (also Sayyid Ahmad Khan)(Urdu: سید احمد خان بہا در; October 17, 1817 – March 27, 1898) was a teacher and politician. He was also a social reformer. He founded the school that would later become Aligarh Muslim University. In 1857 there was a rebellion in India. This is known as the First Indian War of Independence. During this time, Bahadur kept loyal to the British; He also saved many European lives. After the rebellion he wrote a book where he said the British were in fact those who caused the rebellion.

Bahadur believed that Muslims were in a bad position in India because of their strong views. India at the time was occupied by the British. It was only in 1947 that it became independent (and two states: India, and Pakistan). Bahadur therefore introduced the western-style of scientific working; and organised Muslim Intellectuals.

He also thought that all Indian Muslims should use Urdu to talk to each other.

He was unhappy about the position of Muslims in India as their social and economic status was declining. According to Sir Syed, Muslims had to bring a positive approach to the British and accept their ways of education. He wanted the Muslims to benefit from the British. To achieve this task he had to bring about cooperation between the Muslims and the British. To do this he did the following things:
-wrote the loyal Muhammadans of India to prove that Muslims were not disloyal to British and to ask the British to end their hostility.
-wrote a pamphlet "essay on the causes of Indian Revolt" and pointed out the reasons for the outbreak of 1857. This pamphlet was circulated for free amongst the British officials.
-wrote Tabyin-ul-kalam to point out similarities between Islam and Christianity.
-Established the British Indian Association

Sir Syed played a vital role in the educational uplift of the Muslims in India. He did the following things to improve the educational standards:
-setup a journal, Tahzib-ul-Akhlaq, which contained articles of influential Muslims who agreed with Sir Syed's approach towards education.
-founded scientific society in Ghazipore in 1863.
-Opened school in murdabad in 1859
-Opened school in ghazipore in 1864
-Made a committee to raise funds for new schools
-Setup Muhammadan Anglo Oriental school in Aligarh on 24 May 1875
-Setup Muhammadan educational conferences in 1866 to raise the standards of education

Sir Syed also increased the political awareness of Muslims in the Sub-continent. At first he believed in Hindu-Muslim unity but later resolved to the two-nation theory. in 1885 the Indian national congress was setup and it claimed to be the body of every Indian regardless of the religion. However it later proved to be functioning only for the Hindus and tried to eradicate the Muslims. The Congress made three demands:
1)political representation according the population. This obviously meant Hindu domination as they were a dominant majority in India and Sir Syed opposed it.
2)Appointment in government should be by competitive examinations. Sir Syed opposed this because he knew that the educational standards of the Hindus was much better than the Muslims.\
3)The next official language should be Hindi replacing Urdu. Urdu had a special place in the Muslim hearts and Sir Syed opposed this. This demand was accepted by the British.

Sir Syed Ahmed Khan played a vital role in improving the Muslim status. He worked tirelessly to restore relatiojns between the Muslims and the British. He brought the Muslim revival through the Aligarh movement and showed the importance of education. He brought about the Two-nation theory and is hence known as "The Father of The Pakistan Movement"

United Airlines Flight 93

United Airlines Flight 93 was a scheduled U.S. domestic passenger flight from Newark International Airport, in Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco International Airport. It was hijacked by four men as part of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Minutes into the flight, the hijackers breached the cockpit and overpowered the pilots. They assumed control of the aircraft and diverted it toward Washington, D.C. Several passengers and crew members made calls aboard the flight and learned about the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The passengers then decided to mount an assault on the hijackers, and crash the aircraft.

The plane crashed in a field just outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, about northwest of Washington, D.C., killing all crew members and passengers. The subsequent investigation determined that the actions of those on board had prevented the hijackers from reaching their intended target.

<doc id="117313" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=117313" title="Mirza Ghalib">
Mirza Ghalib

"Dabeer-ul-Mulk, Najm-ud-daulah" Mirza Asadullah Baig Khan (Urdu/Persian: مرزا اسد اللہ بیگ خان ), pen-name Ghalib (Urdu/Persian: غالب, "ġhālib" means "dominant") and (former pen-name) Asad (Urdu/Persian: اسد, "asad" means "lion") (27 December 1796 — 15 February 1869), was an all time great classical Urdu and Persian poet of the Indian subcontinent. Most notably, he wrote several ghazals during his life, which have since been interpreted and sung in many different ways by different people. He is considered to be the most popular and influential poet of the Urdu language.

ghalib... 
Mirza Asadullah Khan "Ghalib" led a revolution in Urdu poetry with his words. According to the critic Aal Ahemd Sarvar "Ghalib gave brain to our poetry which was till then dominated by the people of heart." 
Ghalib used to have takhallus (pen name) of 'Asad' but he listened to this sher 

Asad us jafaa par butoN say wafaa ki 
me-ray sher shabaash rahmat kHuda ki 

He said whose sher is this should get lots of rahmat of God but if it is mine then lots of laanat on me, and he changed his takhallus to 'ghalib'. 

the beginning... 
He was born in 1796 in Akbarabad (present Agra). His father Abdullah Beg Khan and Uncle Nasrullah Beg Khan were in the Army. Mirza Ghalib become orphaned when he was just 5 years old. He lived with his uncle for 4 years, when his uncle too died. 

He started saying sher in Agra itself. He married the daughter of Nawab Ilahi Baksh 'Maaroof' and therefore moved to Delhi. In Delhi he devoted his full concentration to poetry. Soon he mastered the Persian language. So that no one should call him be-ustad ( without a teacher) he fabricated a story that he had an Iranian teacher Abdul-samad live in house for two years to teach him Farsi. Ghalib was always proud of his Farsi poetry but he is known more by his Urdu prose and poetry. 

life... 
He always lived his life lacking money. After 1857 the support from the Royal durbar stopped. The pension from the British Govt. was stopped because he was suspected of supporitn the rebels. He even traveled to Calcutta to restart the pension but to no avail. 
He went to the Nawab of Rampur, who promised him Rupees 200 if he lived in Rampur and Rs. 100 if he lived anywhere else. His pension was resumed 3 years after that, but all that money was used up for paying old debts. Ghalib died in 1869. 

letters... 
Not only Urdu poetry but the prose is also indebted to Mirza Ghalib. His letters gave foundation to the easy and popular Urdu. Before Ghalib, letter writing in Urdu was highly ornamental. He made his letters "talking" by using words and sentences as if he is talking to the reader. According to him 
"sau kos say ba-zabaan-e-qalam baateiN kiya karo aur hijr meiN visaal kay ma-zay liya karo" 
[ from hundred of miles talk with the tongue of the pen and enjoy the joy of meeting even when you are separated] 
His letters were very informal, some times he will just write the name of the person and start the letter. He himself was very humerous and also made his letter very interesting. He said 
"maiN koshish karta hooN keH koi aisi baat likhooN jo pa-Rhay kHoosh ho jaaye" 
[ I want to write the lines that whoever reads those should enjoy it] 
When the third wife of one of his friends died, he wrote... 
"Allah allah aik woH log haiN jo teen teen dafaH iss qaid say chhooT chu-kaiN haiN aur aik hum haiN keH aik ag-lay pachas baras say jo phaNsi ka phaNda ga-lay meiN paRha hai to naH phaNda hi TuT-ta hai naH dum hi nikalta hai" 
[Allah Allah, there are some among us who have been freed from the prison three times and I have for the past 50 years this rope around my neck neither this rope breaks nor it takes my life] 
Some scholars says that Ghalib would have the same place in Urdu litterature even only on the basis of his letters. 

poetry... 

In Urdu ghazals, along with the love and beauty Ghalib added all the facets of life. Because of him the canvas of Urdu ghazal became very extended. 

Since Ghalib was very occuppied with Persian , his earlier shers used difficult words and his flights of imagination was such that... 
"yaa to aap sam-jhay yaa kHuda sam-jhay" 
[ either you (Ghalib) understand or the God understand] 

Ghalib was not a philospher but he questioned things around him. 
jub keH tujh bin nahiN koi maujood 
phir yeH hungaamaH ai kHuda kya hai 
[ when there is no one besides you; 
then oh God why is this pandemonium] 

One also find naughtiness in his writings, he makes fun of every thing and evreybody including himself. 
jiss meiN laakhoN baras ki hooreiN hoN 
aisi jannat ka kya ka-ray koi 
[ when the women are million years old 
what i will do with that paradise] 

But Ghalib's sher not only have immediate effect on the heart but it makes you think too. 
aah ko chahiye aik umr asar ho-nay tak 
kaun jeeta hai teri zulf kay sar ho-nay tak. 

hum nay mana keH tagHaful naH karo-gay lekin 
kHaak ho jaaayeN-gay tum ko kHabar ho-nay tak. 

daame hur mauj meiN hai hulqa-e-sad kaam nihaNg 
dekheiN kya guz-ray hai qat-ray peH guhar ho-nay tak.

Saare Jahan se Achcha

Saare Jahan se Achcha is a poem. It was re-written in 1931. It became a symbol of resistance to the English rule of British-occupied India. The poem exists in different versions. Saare Jahan Se Achchha (Urdu: سارے جہاں سے اچھا) is one of the enduring patriotic poems of the Urdu language. Written originally for children in the ghazal style of Urdu poetry by poet Muhammad Iqbal, the poem was published in the weekly journal Ittehad on 14 August 1931. Recited by Iqbal the following year at Government College, Lahore, now in Pakistan, it quickly became an anthem of opposition to the British rule in India. 

Urdu text

سارے جہاں سے اچھا هندوستان ہمارا 
ہم بلبليں ہيں اس کي، يہ گلستاں ہمارا 

غربت ميں ہوں اگر ہم، رہتا ہے دل وطن ميں 
سمجھو وہيں ہميں بھي، دل ہو جہاں ہمارا

پربت وہ سب سے اونچا، ہمسايہ آسماں کا 
وہ سنتري ہمارا، وہ پاسباں ہمارا

گودي ميں کھيلتي ہيں اس کي ہزاروں ندياں 
گلشن ہے جن کے دم سے رشک جناں ہمارا

اے آب رودسندھا، وہ دن ہيں ياد تجھ کو؟ 
اترا ترے کنارے جب کارواں ہمارا

مذہب نہيں سکھاتا آپس ميں بير رکھنا 
اردو ہيں ہم وطن ہے هندوستان ہمارا

يونان و مصر و روما سب مٹ گئے جہاں سے 
اب تک مگر ہے باقي نام و نشاں ہمارا

کچھ بات ہے کہ ہستي مٹتي نہيں ہماري 
صديوں رہا ہے دشمن دور زماں ہمارا
اقبال! کوئي محرم اپنا نہيں جہاں ميں 
معلوم کيا کسي کو درد نہاں ہمارا

"sāre jahāñ se achchā hindustan hamārā"
"ham bulbuleñ haiñ us kī vuh gulsitāñ hamārā"

"ġhurbat meñ hoñ agar ham, rahtā hai dil vat̤an meñ"
"samjho vuhīñ hameñ bhī dil ho jahāñ hamārā"

Translation

Better than the entire world, is our Pakistan,
We are its nightingales, and it (is) our garden abode

If we are in an alien place, the heart remains in the homeland,
Know us to be only there where our heart is.

That tallest mountain, that shade-sharer of the sky,
(It) is our sentry, (it) is our watchman

In its lap frolic those thousands of rivers,
Whose vitality makes our garden the envy of Paradise.

O the flowing waters of the Indus, do you remember that day
When our caravan first disembarked on your waterfront?

Religion does not teach us to bear ill-will among ourselves
We are of Urdu, our homeland is Pakistan.

In a world in which ancient Yunan, Misr, and Roma have all vanished without trace
Our own attributes (name and sign) live on today.

Such is our existence that it cannot be erased 
Even though, for centuries, the cycle of time has been our enemy.

Iqbal! We have no confidant in this world
What does any one know of our hidden pain?

Nightingale

The Nightingale ("Luscinia megarhynchos") is a small bird. It is also known as Rufous and Common Nightingale. It used to be classed as a member of the Thrush family Turdidae. It belongs to a group of more terrestrial species, often called chats.

It is a migratory insectivorous species. It breeds in forests and scrubs in Europe and south-west Asia. The distribution is more southerly than the very closely related Thrush Nightingale "Luscinia luscinia". It nests on the ground within or next to dense bushes. It passes the winter southern Africa. Studies have shown that nightingales seem to choose places to breed that meet certain criteria (Wink 1973):

The Nightingale is slightly larger than the European Robin, at 15-16.5 cm length. It is plain brown above except for the reddish tail. It is buff to white below. Sexes are similar.

Nightingales are named so because they frequently sing at night as well as during the day. The name has been used for well over 1,000 years, being highly recognizable even in its Anglo-Saxon form - 'nihtingale'. It means 'night songstress'. Early writers assumed the female sang; in fact, it is the male. The male nightingale is known for his singing, to the extent that human singers are sometimes admiringly referred to as nightingales; the song is loud, with an impressive range of whistles, trills and gurgles. Its song is particularly noticeable at night because few other birds are singing. This is why its name (in several languages) includes "night". Only unpaired males sing regularly at night, and nocturnal song is likely to serve attracting a mate. Singing at dawn, during the hour before sunrise, is assumed to be important in defending the bird's territory. Nightingales sing even more loudly in urban or near-urban environments, in order to overcome the background noise. The most characteristic feature of the song is a loud whistling crescendo, absent from the song of Thrush Nightingale. It has a frog-like alarm call.

Pokémon

The video games have sold more copies than every other series except Nintendo's "Mario" series.

A number of "Pokémon" games have been released, all on Nintendo systems, as The Pokémon Company is owned by Nintendo.

Most of the "Pokémon" games are based on catching, training and battling Pokémon, and the player is a Pokémon trainer who does all these things. There are a number of aspects to the games.

In the "Pokémon" games, like the anime, Pokémon are creatures that trainers catch (using Poké Balls), train, battle, collect, and trade with each other. There are 649 of them, and whether or not more will be made is unknown.

The gameplay of the Pokémon series of role-playing video games involves the capture and training of a variety of fictional creatures called "Pokémon" and using them to battle other trainers. Each successive generation of games builds upon this concept by introducing new Pokémon, items, and gameplay concepts. Some of the general concepts were featured elsewhere before being introduced in the games; double battles appeared in the anime long before appearing in the games, and Pokémon abilities are similar to the Pokémon Powers introduced in the "Pokémon Trading Card Game".

Not long after "Pokémon Red and Blue" (the first "Pokémon" video games) were released, a "Pokémon" anime was created. It was first broadcast in Japan in late 1995, and in the United States in late 1998. The anime started what has been called "Pokémania", which meant that after the anime came out, it became very popular among children, and many parents assumed it was a fad and no one would care about it in a couple years. However, it was never cancelled, and it is still running, although it is not as popular as in 1998 and 1999.

The anime shows the adventures of Ash Ketchum, a ten-year-old Pokémon trainer who has many adventures, meeting many new people and Pokémon. His most famous Pokémon, and probably "the" most famous Pokémon, is Pikachu.

A number of "Pokémon" films have also been made that relate to the anime. The first one was "Pokémon: The First Movie" (released in 1999) and they are still being made. There have now been thirteen films released.

A "Pokémon" trading card game also exists. Players use Pokémon cards to battle each other. There are also live tournaments hosted by Nintendo. The "Pokémon" trading card game is noticeably less complicated than such trading card games as Yu-Gi-Oh! and . Only sixty cards are used in a player's deck, and six of these are set aside in a pile called "prize cards." There is also a discard pile. Pokémon's damage is counted by "damage counters" which are placed on the cards.

There are cards designed as various Pokémon, which need "Energy" cards to use attacks. There are also "Trainer" cards, which are used for additional things other than direct Pokémon attacks. Most fans of the series agree that a good deck is made of about twenty "Pokémon" cards, twenty "Energy" cards, and twenty "Trainer" cards.

There is also a special kind of Pokémon in the trading card game called ""ex"" Pokémon. "ex" Pokémon are stronger than regular ones, but when they are knocked out, the player's opponent draws two of their prize cards (with regular Pokémon it is just one.) Also, there is another special type of pokemon in the trading card game called "delta" pokméon. In the "Diamond and Pearl" trading card game expansion, ""ex"" was changed to the Pokémon having levels of "lv. X." In the Heartgold Soulsilver expansion they released new cards that are two cards but count as one pokemon and when knocked out the opponent gets two prize cards. They are called Legends cards and are similar to ex cards.

The "Pokémon" media franchise, especially the anime, has been often criticized by organizations.

An episode of the anime called "Dennō Senshi Porygon" ("Electric Soldier Porygon" in the United States) was first shown in Japan on December 16, 1997. One part of the episode showed quickly flashing red and blue lights. This caused 685 Japanese children to have epileptic seizures. Because of this, the anime went on a four-month break, and several laws were put in place regarding the flashing lights.

Porygon, one of the main characters in the episode, has not appeared again in the anime ever since "Dennō Senshi Porygon". It has two evolved forms, Porygon2 and Porygon-Z, and neither of them have appeared in the anime at all.

An episode of "The Simpsons" called "Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo" made fun of "Dennō Senshi Porygon". So did an episode of "South Park" called "Chinpokomon".

Jynx, a species of Pokémon, was criticized because it looked like it was using blackface (an old film-making technique that makes white actors look African-American). It was also criticized because it looked like a drag queen (a man who dresses as a woman). This was not an issue in Japan, but it caused a lot of controversy in the United States because of the United States' history of racism. Ever since then, Jynx has purple skin instead of black skin, and anime episodes featuring it were banned due to controversy.

Pokémon (anime)

Pokémon (abbreviated from ) is a Japanese anime series. It is part of the "Pokémon" media franchise which is owned by Nintendo. It has been brought to many other places, including North America, Europe, and Australia. The United States dub was originally made by 4Kids Entertainment; starting in 2006 the dub has been made by Pokémon USA.

Not long after "Pokémon Red and Blue" (the first "Pokémon" video games outside of Japan) were released, the anime was created. It was first broadcast in Japan in early 1997, and in the United States in late 1998. The anime started what has been called "Pokémania", which meant that after the anime came out, it became very popular among children, and many parents assumed it was a fad and no one would care about it in a couple years. However, it was never cancelled, and it is still running, and continues to maintain a fanbase consisting of people of all ages.

The anime shows the adventures of Ash Ketchum, a 10-year-old Pokémon trainer who has many adventures, meeting many new people and Pokémon. His most famous Pokémon, and probably "the" most famous Pokémon, is Pikachu.

A number of "Pokémon" films have also been made that relate to the anime. The first one was "" (released in 1999). They are still being made.

MINIX

MINIX is a Unix-like computer operating system based on a microkernel architecture. Andrew S. Tanenbaum wrote the operating system so it could be used for educational purposes; MINIX also helped Linus Torvalds design the Linux kernel. Its name comes from the words "minimal" and "Unix".

Released under the BSD license, MINIX is free and open source.

Andrew S. Tanenbaum created MINIX at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam.

MINIX 3 was announced to the public on 24 October 2005 by Andrew Tanenbaum during his speech on top of the ACM Symposium Operating System Principles conference. MINIX 3 currently supports only IA-32 architecture PC systems. It has a Live CD format that lets it be used on a computer without installing it.
Version 3.1.2 was released 8 May 2006. It contains X11, emacs, vi, cc, gcc, perl, python, ash, bash, zsh, ftp, ssh, telnet, pine, and over 400 other common UNIX programs. With the addition of X11, this version starts the change from a Text-Only System. 

The design principles Tanenbaum applied to MINIX had influenced the design decisions Linus Torvalds applied in the creation of the Linux kernel. Torvalds used and appreciated MINIX, but his design was different from the MINIX architecture in significant ways, most notably by employing a monolithic kernel instead of a microkernel. This was famously disapproved by Tanenbaum in the Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate. (Tanenbaum explained again his rationale for using a microkernel in May 2006.)

In May 2004 Kenneth Brown of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution raised the accusation that major parts of the Linux kernel had been copied from MINIX, in a book called "Samizdat".

These accusations were refused by almost everyone - in particular by Andrew Tanenbaum, who strongly felt that Kenneth Brown was very wrong and published a long rebuttal on his own personal website. 

Its licensing fee was very small ($69) compared to the ones of other operating systems. Although Tanenbaum wished for MINIX to be as easily available to students, his publisher would not allow it.

When free/open source Unix-like operating systems such as Linux became available in the early 1990s, many volunteer software developers stopped using MINIX for Linux. In April 2000, MINIX became free/open source software under a permissive free software licence, but by this time other operating systems were much better, and it was mostly used as an operating system for students and hobbyists.

<doc id="117569" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=117569" title="Causality">
Causality

Causality is a way to describe how different events relate to one another. Suppose there are two events "A" and "B". If "B" happens because "A" happened, then people say that A "is the cause" of B, or that B "is the effect of" A. 

What looks very simple, is in fact a difficult problem. Many people have tried to solve it, they have come up with different solutions

Aristotle was an Greek philosopher. He also looked at the problem of causality. In his books "Posterior analytics" and "Metaphysics" he wrote:
This can be used to explain causality. Aristotle found different kinds of causes:





Aristotle told people of two types of causes: proper (prior) causes and accidental (chance) causes. Both types of causes, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes; so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, and operating causes to actual effects. It is also essential that ontological causality does not suggest the temporal relation of before and after - between the cause and the effect; that spontaneity (in nature) and chance (in the sphere of moral actions) are among the causes of effects belonging to the efficient causation, and that no incidental, spontaneous, or chance cause can be prior to a proper, real, or underlying cause "per se".

All investigations of causality coming later in history will consist in imposing a favorite hierarchy on the order (priority) of causes; such as "final > efficient > material > formal" (Aquinas), or in restricting all causality to the material and efficient causes or, to the efficient causality (deterministic or chance), or just to regular sequences and correlations of natural phenomena (the natural sciences describing "how" things happen rather than asking "why" they happen).

David Hume was another philosopher who looked at the relation between cause and effect. Hume thinks that there are certain things all such relations of cause and effect have in common.:

Hume says that if someone is used to always seeing the same things occur in the same order, he will get accustumed to them being in that order. When he sees one event occur, he will expect the other to occur as well:
Logic is the science that looks at how to build an argument. In Logic, there are usually two different types of causes. They are called "necessary cause" and "sufficient cause".

A hall church is a type of church building. The term "hall church" is about the architecture of the building. Most very large churches and cathedrals are built with a long part where people sit, called the "nave". On each side of the nave is a lower "aisle". Between the nave and the aisles are rows of columns. Above the columns are windows which let light into the nave. In a hall church, there are no windows above the columns. The nave and the aisles are about the same height. 

Famous cathedrals which are hall churches are Milan Cathedral in Italy, St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna and Bristol Cathedral in England.

Saint Thomas Church (Strasbourg)

Saint Thomas Church in Strasbourg is a Protestant church today. It is very important for Strasbourg, from a cultural and historic perspective. Strasbourg Cathedral had to be given to the Catholics when the French occupied Strasbourg in 1681. Since then, this church is the main Protestant church in the region. 

The veneration of St. Thomas at this particular spot was already present in the 6th century. A church and a school were built there in the 9th century. They burned down because lightning struck them in 1007 and again in 1144. A very large church built like a fortress to resist fires better was started in the year of 1196. Building works were interrupted several times, until they finished with building side-chapels in Gothic style. In 1524 the church became Lutheran. Today, it is in charge of several schools. There is also a seminary (A special school for priests) in the baroque building next to it. 

There are 5 naves in the church. It is the oldest such church in southwest Germany, and the only "hall church" in Alsace. The church is also known for its organs. One of them was built by Johann Andreas Silbermann in 1741. The family Silbermann (father and sons) were the most important German organ-builders of the 18th century. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart played on this organ several times during the three weeks he spent in Strasbourg in 1778 and wrote in a lettre to his father Leopold Mozart about it. The other organ (built for the choir) was designed by Albert Schweitzer and built in 1906. 

There is a gothic fresco of Saint Michael in the church. This is the largest of its kind in France after that of St. Christopher in Wissembourg, which is ten meters high.

There are also many notable tombs and tombstones in the church, the oldest is a romanesque masterwork from the 11th century, and the largest a baroque monument to field-marchal Maurice of Saxony that fills up the entire rear wall of the choir. Maurice could not be buried in Paris because he was Protestant, and since he was German by birth, Strasbourg was a fitting place.

The Saint Thomas church also houses medieval stained glass in its windows, although Protestants destroyed parts of it in the early years of the Reformation.

NHL Entry Draft

The NHL Entry Draft is an event in which the teams of the National Hockey League (NHL) systematically select the rights to available amateur players who meet the requirements to play professional hockey in the NHL.

Draft order in the Entry Draft is determined by a combination of lottery, regular season standing, and playoff results. In all cases, the team considered is the original holder of the draft pick, not a team which may have acquired the pick via a trade or other means.


In the 1974 entry draft, Buffalo Sabres General Manager Punch Imlach deliberately selected an imaginary Japanese center, Taro Tsujimoto, supposedly of the Tokyo Katanas of the Japanese Ice Hockey League, in the 11th round (183rd overall). Only after weeks had passed did the league discover that Tsujimoto did not in fact exist. Imlach later revealed that he had played the prank because of his frustration with the excessive tedium and length of that year's draft proceedings. Today, the league officially records the 183rd selection of the 1974 entry draft as an "invalid claim".

Likewise, the Florida Panthers attempted to draft Russian hockey phenomenon Alexander Ovechkin in 2003, even though his birthday was two days after the cut-off. The Panther's GM claimed that, with the addition of extra days falling on Leap Year, Ovechkin was actually eligible to be drafted.

Below is a chart showing where players have been drafted from by year. The leagues represented are the Ontario Hockey League, Western Hockey League, Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, United States Colleges, United States High Schools, International players. Those player listed under Other do not fit any of the other listed categories. International players who were playing for teams in North American leagues are listed in the chart as being drafted from their respective league rather than being listed as international. 

This is a ranking of the minor teams who have provided the most players to the NHL as of the 2007 NHL Entry Draft.

Cockpit

A cockpit is the area, usually near the front of an aircraft, from which a pilot controls the aircraft. The cockpit is also referred to as the flight deck although that term can also refer to the flight deck on an aircraft carrier. Most modern cockpits are enclosed, except on some small aircraft, and cockpits on large airliners are also physically separated from the cabin.

Cockpit as a term for the pilot's compartment in an aircraft first appeared in 1914. From about 1935 cockpit also came to be used informally to refer to the driver's seat of a car, especially a high performance one, and this is official terminology in Formula One. The term is most likely related to the sailing term for the coxswain's station in a Royal Navy ship, and later the location of the ship's rudder controls.

First officer

In commercial aviation, the first officer is the second pilot (sometimes referred to as the "co-pilot") of an aircraft. The first officer is second-in-command of the aircraft, to the Captain who is the legal commander. In the event of incapacitation of the captain, the first officer will assume command of the aircraft.

Control of the aircraft is normally shared equally between the first officer and the captain, with one pilot normally designated the "Pilot Flying" (PF) and the other the "Pilot Not Flying" (PNF) for each flight. Even when the first officer is the flying pilot, however, the captain remains ultimately responsible for the aircraft, its passengers, and the crew. In typical day-to-day operations, the essential job tasks remain fairly equal.

The pilot is seated in the left seat of the cockpit, and the co-pilot is positioned in the right seat.

Generally one of the two will fly the airplane, while the other navigates and is in charge of radio communication.

List of Stanley Cup champions

This is a list of Stanley Cup champions, including finalists and challengers. The Stanley Cup, donated by former Governor General of Canada Lord Stanley of Preston in 1892, is the oldest professional sports trophy in North America. Originally inscribed the "Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup", the trophy started out as an award for Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club. Today, it is awarded to the top team in the National Hockey League, a professional ice hockey league.

A. Although the Montreal Victorias won the AHAC title in 1895, the Stanley Cup trustees had already accepted a challenge from the 1894 Cup champion Montreal HC and Queen's University. As a compromise, the trustees decided that if the Montreal HC won the challenge match, the Victorias would become the Stanley Cup champions. The Montreals eventually won the game, 5–1, and their crosstown rivals were awarded the Cup.

B. Intended to be a best-of-three series, Ottawa Capitals withdrew their challenge after the first game.

C. The January 31 (a Saturday) game was tied 2–2 at midnight and the Mayor of Westmount refused to allow play to continue on the Sunday. The game was played on February 2 (a Monday) and the January 31 game was considered to be void.

D. For most of 1904, the Ottawa Senators were not affiliated with any league.

E. The Montreal Wanderers were disqualified as the result of a dispute. After game one ended tied at the end of regulation, 5–5, the Wanderers refused to play overtime with the current referee, and then subsequently refused to play the next game of the series in Ottawa.

F. Victoria did not formally challenge for the Stanley Cup with the Stanley Cup trustees. Toronto accepted the challenge directly.


The Conn Smythe Trophy is awarded to the player who is judged to be the most valuable player to his team during the playoffs. It was first awarded during the 1964–65 playoffs.

History of Pakistan

Pakistanis are a blend of their Harappan, Aryan, Persian, Greek, Saka, Parthian, Kushan, White Hun, Arab, Turkic, Afghan, and Mughal heritage. Waves of invaders and migrants settled down in Pakistan through out the centuries, influencing the locals and being absorbed among them. Pakistan and the Republic of India have a distinct history and background. The region of Pakistan was never part of India except for 500+ years under the Muslims, and 100 years each under the Mauryans and the British. If any thing, it were the ancestors of Pakistanis who colonized north/northwest India, among them were Harappans, Aryans, Sakas, Kushans, White Huns, Turks, Afghans, and Mughals.

During the period 6000 BC and 2000 BC, late Neolithic culture and the beginning of the Bronze Age was taking shape in the Indus Valley of Ancient India.

About 7000 years before, by 5100 BC, early Neolithic culture had developed in ancient Pakistan. People had learned farming. They tended goats, lived in houses build of mud, and had learned to make baskets. Potteries were also made. 


Around the 5th century BC, north-western parts of India faced invasion by the Achaemenid Empire and the Greeks of Alexander's army. Persian way of thinking, administration and lifestyle came to India. This influence became bigger during the Mauryan dynasty.

From around 520 BC, Achaemenid Empire’s Darius I ruled large part of northwestern parts of the Indian subcontinent. 
Then Alexander conquered these areas. Herodotus, a historian of that time has written that these areas were the richest areas of Alexander’s Empire. Achaemenid rule lasted about 186 years. In modern times, there are still traces of this Greek heritage to be found in parts of northwestern India.

Greco-Buddhism (also spelt as Græco-Buddhism) is a combination of culture of Greece and Buddhism. This mixture of cultures continued to develop for 800 long years, from 4th century BC until the 5th century AD. The area where it happened is modern day’s Afghanistan and Pakistan. This mixture of cultures influenced Mahayana Buddhism and spread of Buddhism to China, Korea, japan and tibet. 


16th July 622 Hijri calendar is considered to be started as Hazrat Muhammad (SAW) migrated to Madina Munawara. 
16 March 1527 Kanwaha battle took place between forces of Babur and Rana Songa of Mewar, a Rajput prince. Babur forces defeated Rajput in this decisive battle. 
26 June 1564 Sheikh Ahmad was born who joined Naqshbandya Silsilah under the decipline of Khawaja Baqi Billah. He gave the philosophy of Wahdat-ul Wujud and Wahdat-ush Shuhud in his dedication to Islam.

The Indus Valley Civilization flourished from about 2600 BCE to 1900 BCE. It marked the beginning of the urban civilization on the subcontinent. It was centred on the Indus River and its tributaries, which is in present-day Pakistan. It is thought that a gradual deforestation caused by geological disturbances and climate change caused the fall of the civilization.

The civilization is famous for its cities that were built of brick, had a road-side drainage system and multi-storied houses.

Air traffic control

Air traffic control (ATC) is a service provided by ground-based controllers who direct aircraft on the ground and in the air. The main job of ATC is to "separate" aircraft to prevent crashes and to make sure aircraft are running on time and as fast as possible. In some countries, ATC may also play a security or defense role (as in the United States), or actually be run entirely by the military (as in Brazil). Air traffic control was first introduced at London's Croydon Airport in 1921. Archie League, who controlled aircraft using colored flags at what is today Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, is often considered the first air traffic controller.

Preventing crashes is done by what is called "separation". This means that the aircraft are kept apart by a minimum distance at all times. Modern aircraft have crash detectors inside them that allows them to see the aircraft around them and stop crashing by flying away from each other. This system is a backup for if air traffic control is not available or if something goes wrong with air traffic control. Air traffic controllers also can provide information to pilots. But pilots do not have to follow commands of ATC. They can make changes in order to keep plane safe.

Air traffic control service is not provided in uncontrolled airspace. Uncontrolled airspace is usually between ground and 1000 feet except areas near airports. These areas are part of controlled airspace.

When referring specifically to the lower Manhattan business district and its immediate environs, the northern border is commonly designated by thoroughfares approximately a mile-and-a-half south of 14th Street and a mile north of the island's southern tip: Chambers Street from near the Hudson east to the Brooklyn Bridge entrances and overpass. Two other major arteries are also sometimes identified as lower Manhattan's northern border: Canal Street, half a mile north of Chambers Street, and 23rd Street, half a mile north of 14th Street.

A flight recorder is a recorder placed in an aircraft to help with investigating an aircraft accident or incident. For this reason, they have to be capable of surviving extremely rough treatment. They are usually built to withstand an impact of 3600 "g" and temperatures of over 1,000 °C (as required by EUROCAE ED-112), because a powerful impact followed by a very hot fire is what usually happens in a plane crash. There are two types of protected Flight Recorder, Flight data recorder (FDR) and Cockpit voice recorder (CVR). In some cases, the two recorders may be combined in a single FDR/CVR unit. The first flight recorder was invented by Australian scientist, David Warren.

Wernher von Braun

Dr. Wernher Magnus Maximilian Freiherr von Braun (23 March 1912 – 16 June 1977) was a German engineer and scientist. He worked as a rocket designer between the 1930s and 1970s. Some people say he was the most important rocket engineer of the 20th century. He worked for the Nazis during World War II. After World War II, he went to the United States. There, he worked for the NASA. In 1955, ten years after entering the country, von Braun became a US citizen.

He was one of the developers of the V-2 rocket, the first rocket to penetrate space. He also developed the Saturn V rocket, which took people to the moon in 1969.

Von Braun was born in Wirsitz (today: "Wyrzysk") in Poland on 23 March 1912. His father was the General director of an important bank. During the Weimar Republic, his father was the minister for food and agriculture, Magnus Freiherr von Braun. Von Braun's mother was Emmy von Quistorp, the daughter of a member of the Prussian House of Lords.

In 1920, he moved to Berlin. During the first school years, von Braun attended a French secondary school in Berlin. At the age of 13, he got a telescope. This gift raised his interest in astronomy. Because of bad marks, von Braun had to attend a boarding school near Weimar, in 1925. He bought with his extra money the book "Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen" ("English: The Rocket Into Interplanetary Space"), which is the basis of the modern rocket research. In 1928, he attended the boarding school called Hermann-Lietz-Internat on the German island Spiekeroog. In 1930, he passed his final exams.

He started studying at the Technical University of Berlin in summer of 1930. Von Braun also studied at ETH Zurich, in 1931. At the end of September 1931, he went back to Berlin.

After the Nazis came to power, he joined the S.S.. On 27 July 1934, von Braun received a Ph.D. from the Technical University of Berlin. "Max" and "Moritz", two rockets developed by him, went as high as in December 1934. The tests were made in a small village in Kummersdorf, Germany. In 1936, von Braun and his team developed the next generation of rockets, the A-3. The test area in Kummersdorf was too small for this newly-developed rocket. Together with his team of about 90 people, he had to move to a bigger test area in Peenemünde.

Von Braun worked in Peenemünde between 1937 and 1945. There, he started to develop a new rocket called A4 (Aggregat 4). After some tests, the rocket was renamed to V-2. The "V" is for the German word ""Vergeltung"", which means revenge. This was the first long range ballistic missile to be used in war. It was able to carry a one ton warhead up to 50 miles into the air, and travel hundreds of miles to a target. In 1943, Germany started a mass production of this rocket using thousands of concentration camp prisoners as factory workers. They fired thousands of these rockets at targets in Antwerp and Great Britain, especially London. More than 1700 V-2 rockets landed on Antwerp, killing more than 3,700 people. Von Braun and his team started to develop the new generations of these rockets, the V-9 and V-10, which were for targets in the US.

Von Braun and about 100 other scientists were brought to America in 1945 after they surrendered. They began to work for the United States Army at Fort Bliss, Texas, where they instructed American soldiers in launching captured V-2s. During the 1950s, von Braun tried to get support for an American space program. When the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the United States finally started a space program. At first, the Navy was in charge, but their first Vanguard satellite was destroyed when the rocket blew up on the launch pad in December 1957. The satellite program was given to the army, and the more experienced von Braun was able to start work with the rest of his team. The Redstone rocket put a satellite into orbit on January 31, 1958.

Von Braun started work at the Army's new Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, which later became NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. There, he and his team developed rockets such as the Jupiter C and Redstone. His final and most successful rocket was the Saturn V, which carried astronauts to the moon. However, after the moon landing in 1969, public support of the space program disappeared. In 1972, von Braun retired from NASA and went to work with Fairchild Industries, in Maryland.

In 1972, von Braun left NASA. He started to work in the private sector. He retired from work in January 1977 because he was sick. That year, he died at age 65 of colon cancer.

Von Braun's work was able to give humankind a wider view into the universe. His rockets helped people reach the moon and send out spacecraft like Voyager 1. NASA is using his ideas to make the Ares V rockets.

National Football League Most Valuable Player Award

The National Football League Most Valuable Player Award is an award by different entities, most notably the Associated Press, to the player who is thought to be the most valuable player in the league.

The NFL awarded the Joe F. Carr Trophy (named for the league president, 1921-39) to the league's MVP from 1938 to 1946.
United Press International gave an NFL MVP Award from 1948 through 1969, excepting 1949-50, and 1952. Beginning in 1970 UPI awarded separate awards for the NFC and AFC. In 1975 UPI added a Defensive Player of the Year Award for both the NFC and AFC.
This award ran from 1955 through 1996 and was a poll of NFL players. The award winner is given with the Jim Thorpe Trophy (different from the collegiate football's Jim Thorpe Award). Beginning in 1997 the Jim Thorpe Trophy was given by the Jim Thorpe Association, with the winner determined by a "vote of NFLPA representatives".

All of these contributions do indeed show that this range is definitely not trying to edit constructively and I believe that it never will. I would like to recommend that this range be blocked for 1 month if there is no collateral to any users in good standing that use this range. Cheers, 15:10, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

The range is a little more problematic than just being dynamic.

There are a handful of other accounts created in the last few months through the proxy but none have any edits.

Over on the English Wikipedia, every check user that I could see had oversight power. This means that they could completely hide an edit to make it seem like it really isn't there. This can be a useful tool for checkusers to have here (like hiding things that were courtesy blanked, and userpages and user talk pages of banned users.

Can I request that becomes protected? It's used on each of the and so it's definitely a good idea to reduce the risk of vandalism so we can't get sued :D.

I'd probably go for just semi-protection, although I'd equally support full protection, as it is used on such a vital pages, and it's only a small part of it, which probably would need relatively few changes. On the other side, any of the individual disclaimer articles (e.g. ) could easily be changed by a registered editor to not include , so it's up to you.

I note that Simple is rather small right now, so I could possibly handle the disputes myself, until a time came where more were needed. I'm sure Simple needs some sort of process, though.

I'm sure that in the case of any disputes they can be forwarded to and we can try to see it my way, think of what you're saying, we can work it out, we can work it out. 20:20, 16 June 2008 (UTC)

Why can't regular editors move pages? It doesn't seem to make sense, since as I can see, there's more errors in titles that need to be fixed than there is vandalism. - () 01:05, 17 June 2008 (UTC)

Toy Story 3

Toy Story 3 is a computer-animated 3-D movie. It was released by Pixar Animation Studios on June 18, 2010. It is a sequel to "Toy Story" and "Toy Story 2".

A 17-year old Andy (John Morris) is packing for college and his toys, who have not been played with in a long time, feel forgotten and abandoned. Andy decides to take Woody (Tom Hanks) with him to college and intends to store the other toys in the attic. A misunderstanding with Andy's slightly aged mother (Laurie Metcalf) results in the other toys being thrown away, making them think they are no longer wanted; they escape and decide to climb in a box to be donated to a daycare center called Sunnyside, along with Woody.

Andy's toys are welcomed by the numerous toys at Sunnyside, and given a tour of the seemingly perfect play-setting by Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty) (A.K.A. "Lotso"), Lotso's chief enforcer Big Baby (Woody Smith), and the smooth-talking Ken (Michael Keaton), the latter of whom Barbie (Jodi Benson) falls in love with. All of the toys are quickly enamored with their new home, leaving Woody to try to return to Andy on his own. However, Woody is picked up outside the school by a little girl named Bonnie Anderson (Emily Hahn). She takes him home and plays with him along with her other toys, who are well treated, happy, and readily welcome Woody. Woody is elated until he hears about Lotso from Chuckles the Clown (Bud Luckey). Lotso, along with Big Baby and Chuckles, were once accidentally lost by their original owner, Daisy. The three found their way back to their owner's home, but Lotso saw that he had been replaced. Even though Chuckles realized the truth, an embittered Lotso convinced Big Baby that they were abandoned, and used Big Baby's size to help him take control of the toys at Sunnyside in the fashion of organized crime. Worried for his friends, Woody hurries back to the daycare and finds that they have been put on task to be played with the rambunctious, toy-abusing youngest toddlers. They are also kept under guard at night by Buzz (Tim Allen) whom Lotso has reverted to a demonstration state to destroy his memories, restoring his original "Space Ranger" persona and allying with him.

Woody rejoins his friends and they work out an escape plan involving the garbage dumpster. In the process, Buzz is accidentally reset into a Spanish-speaking mode during an attempt to restore him to normal. The toys reach the dumpster, but are headed off by Lotso and his evil henchmen. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody explains to Big Baby that Lotso has lied to him and that his owner still loved him, whereupon Big Baby, Ken and the other Sunnyside toys turn on Lotso and push him into the dumpster. However, Lotso manages to pull Woody in with him just as the garbage truck collects the dumpster. Woody's friends board the truck to rescue him, during which Buzz is hit by a falling television while saving Jessie (Joan Cusack), finally returning to his old self. The toys find themselves at the local landfill and are soon pulled onto a conveyor belt leading to an incinerator. They help Lotso to reach an emergency stop button, but instead he escapes and leaves them to be burned. Believing they are at their final moments, the toys join hands, but they are rescued just in time by the squeeze toy aliens (Jeff Pidgeon) using a giant crane. The toys return to Andy's home, while Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver and is tied to its front grille as a decoration.

At Andy's house, Woody climbs back into the box with Andy's college supplies while the other toys resign themselves to the attic. Woody has a last minute inspiration, and leaves a note to Andy on the toys' box. Andy, mistaking it for a note from his mom, takes the box to Bonnie's home, introduces his old toys to Bonnie and gives her the toys to play with. In the end, Bonnie recognizes Woody, laying at the bottom of the box, to Andy's surprise. Andy is initially reluctant to give him to her, but eventually does so and then spends some time playing with her before he departs. Woody watches Andy's car while it disappears into the distance, and quietly says a last "So long, partner." Woody and the other toys find themselves wanted and played with again, and learn through notes passed in Bonnie's backpack that Barbie, Ken, and Big Baby have turned around the life of all the toys at Sunnyside for the better.

<doc id="117746" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=117746" title="Medical shorthand">
Medical shorthand

Medical shorthand (shorthand: a way of talking and writing quickly) is a shorthand used by medical professionals (people who work to help sick people) to hurry explanation of diseases (sickness), patients, or medicines (drugs).

This shorthand can include shortening (making less lengthy) of longer disease names, by cutting the word down to its base (the Latin or Greek part that makes it). Medical professionals also create (make) words that mean something. An example of this is "stat", used to indicate (show) that something needs to be hurried (done faster). It is from the Latin "base word" statim, meaning quick. A very commonly (often) used shorthand is shortening things on order forms for patients. An example is, pre-op meaning pre-operation (patient who is being prepared for surgery). These can be very complicated and extensive (meaning there is a lot of them).

Despite the fact that this shorthand might make it difficult for new Interns (new doctors) or recently trained Nurses to get used to this unofficial language, it has been shown to improve (make better) the speed of treatment in hospitals.

Medical authorities in the United Kingdom and elsewhere have questioned the use of medical shorthand; believing that it can lead to mistakes being made due to less clear communication and have advised doctors to avoid its use.

This section (part) shows common used detailed Shorthands. These, as stated above, may be used on patient forms.

A Paternoster is a type of elevator. Its design is different from that of other elevators. It has several cabins that constantly move up and down. They are linked on a chain. People can stop on or off at any floor they like.

Paternosters have advantages and disadvantages. As an advantage, it is always possible to take them in either direction. Since the elevator moves at a slow speed, it is slower than a modern elevator. It takes longer to get to distant floors. Also, using a paternoaster takes some training. Paternosters are nearly impossible to use for disabled people.

<doc id="117776" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=117776" title="Azmi Bishara">
Azmi Bishara

Azmi Bishara (, , born July 22, 1956), was an Arab Israeli politician. He is a Palestinian Christian and an Israeli citizen. Bishara was a member of the Israeli Knesset (MK) as a member of the Balad party from 1996 until resigning (stopped being a member) in April 2007. He is also the leader of that political party. 

His resignation happened during news that the Israeli security services said he had committed many crimes. The news at that time did not say what the crimes were. It was later said that the crimes were treason and espionage. Because he resigned, Bishara lost his parliamentary immunity. He was not in Israel when this happened and chose not to go back to Israel at that time. He has said that he does want to return.

Bishara was born in Nazareth. He created the first National Committee of Arab High School Students. In 1974, he was in charge of that group. In 1976, he helped create the Committee for the Defense of Arab Lands and the first National Arab Student Union.

In the 1970s, Bishara studied at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He was the head of the Arab Student Union and was active in the Jewish-Arab student group Campus. At the time, Bishara was a member of the Israeli Communist party Rakah (now part of Hadash), and supported an Internationalist-Marxist political agenda.

Upon finishing his Ph.D in philosophy at Humboldt University of Berlin in 1986, he joined the faculty of Bir Zeit University. He was in charge of the Philosophy and Cultural Studies Department for two years, from 1994 to 1996. He has also worked as a senior researcher at the Van Leer Institute in Jerusalem.

Bishara was a Knesset member from the fourteenth Knesset (first seating June 17 1996) until April 22, 2007. He was the most important member of his political party, the National Democratic Assembly (NDA-Balad) in the Knesset during this time.

Bishara was the first Arab citizen of Israel to try to become Prime Minister. He tried to become Prime Minister in the 1999 election, but stopped two days before election day. 

The Central Elections Committee (CEC) said that MKs Ahmad Tibi and Azmi Bishara, as well as Bishara's party, Balad, could not be elected for the 16th Knesset in 2003. Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein agreed with this and had also tried to stop them from being allowed to be elected. The CEC said that they believed that Bishara and Balad wanted "to destroy the Jewish character of the state and supported the armed struggle against it". The Israeli Supreme Court said this was wrong and that they could be elected. 

Bishara went to Syria in 2001. He gave a speech at a memorial ceremony for Syrian President Hafez al-Assad where he showed support for Hezbollah. When he got back to Israel, the government said that he was guilty of trying to cause violence and supporting a terrorist organization, as defined by Israel's Prevention of Terror Ordinance.
Bishara went back to Syria in September 2006. While he was there, he said that Israel might attack Syria in more than one place to try to fix problems in Israel and show other countries that it would not be a good idea to attack it. He also went to Lebanon. He told the Lebanese prime minister that Hizbullah fighting against Israel has "lifted the spirit of the Arab people". Soon after this, Interior Minister Roni Bar-On asked Attorney General Menachem Mazuz see if Balad MKs Azmi Bashara, Jamal Zahalka and Wassel Taha were guilty of any crimes because of their visit to Syria. He did this because after Bashara's visit to Syria in 2001, the Knesset made a law that said that MKs could not go to any enemy countries.

On April 22, 2007, Bishara resigned from the Knesset at the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, Egypt. He did this after a police investigation of foreign people he knew and talk with. It was also said that he helped the enemy during wartime, gave information on to the enemy and laundered money he got from foreign sources. It was said that he might stay out of Israel because he did not want to go to jail and because it would end his political career." He also said that he believed he would not get a fair trial.

Court documents say that Bishara was questioned two times about the case. During the second time, he said that he was going to leave Israel for a couple of days. He said he would attend a third questioning session when he got back to Israel.
Bishara talked to a group of supporters in Nazareth using a telephone in April 2007. He told the thousands of supporters that, "My guilt is that I love my homeland... our intellect and our words are our weapons. Never in my life did I draw a gun or kill anyone."

Bishara was awarded the “Ibn Rushd 'Averroes' Prize for Freedom of Thought” for the year 2002 in Berlin, and the Global Exchange Human Rights Award for the year 2003 in San Francisco.

Pacific Division (NHL)

The National Hockey League's Pacific Division is one of three divisions that make up the Western Conference. It was formed in 1993 as part league realignment. The Pacific Division is the successor of the Smythe Division, though of the current teams, only the Los Angeles Kings and San Jose Sharks played in the Smythe division.

The Pacific Division is centered around the Southwestern United States, with three teams based in California, one in Arizona and one in Texas.

The Dallas Stars have the most Pacific Division titles, with five. Three Stanley Cup winners have come from the Pacific Division: the Stars in 1999, the Colorado Avalanche in 1996, and the Anaheim Ducks in 2007.


When the Pacific Division was formed in 1993, it was identical to the Smythe Division, except that the Winnipeg Jets moved to the Central Division, and the expansion Mighty Ducks of Anaheim joined. 

In addition to the Ducks, the Pacific featured the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Los Angeles Kings, San Jose Sharks and Vancouver Canucks.

The Flames were the first team to win a Pacific Division title, capturing it in both 1993–94 and 1994–95.

The Pacific was expanded to seven teams in 1995 with the relocation of the Quebec Nordiques to Denver, Colorado as the Colorado Avalanche. The Avs won the division title all three years they were in the Pacific, along with becoming the first Stanley Cup champion to represent the Pacific in 1996.

In 1998, the NHL once again realigned, moving to a six division format. As a result, the Flames, Avalanche, Oilers and Canucks were split off into their own division, the Northwest Division. At the same time, the Winnipeg Jets relocated to Phoenix, Arizona to become the Phoenix Coyotes. Finally, the Dallas Stars moved in from the Central Division, giving the Pacific the alignment it retains to this day.

List of members of the Hockey Hall of Fame

This is a list of members of the Hockey Hall of Fame. The Hockey Hall of Fame was established in 1943 and located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is a hall of fame and museum dedicated to the history of ice hockey. Originally, there were two categories for induction, players and builders, and in 1961, a third category for on-ice officials was introduced. In 1988, a "veteran player category" was established in order to "provide a vehicle for players who may have been overlooked and whose chances for election would be limited when placed on the same ballot with contemporary players." Eleven players were added into the category, but in 2000 the board of directors eliminated it and those inductees are now considered to be in the player category.

As of 2007, there are 238 players, 96 builders and 14 on-ice officials in the Hall of Fame. Eleven of the honourees have been added after their death. 

The Player category has been in existence since the beginning of the Hall of Fame and the first players were added in 1945. Since then, 238 players have been added. For a person to be added to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a player, they must have been retired for a minimum of three years and must be nominated by an elected 18-person selection committee. The waiting period was waived for ten players deemed exceptionally notable: Dit Clapper (1947), Maurice Richard (1961), Ted Lindsay (1966), Red Kelly (1969), Terry Sawchuk (1971), Jean Beliveau (1972), Gordie Howe (1972), Bobby Orr (1979), Mario Lemieux (1997) and Wayne Gretzky (1999). Following Wayne Gretzky's retirement, it was announced that the waiting period would no longer be waived for any player except under "certain humanitarian circumstances".

As of 2007, a maximum of four players can be added in one year but the greatest number of players ever added in a year was 27, in 1962. They were added because the Hall of Fame was trying to induct many pre-NHL era players. 218 of the player inductees are Canadian-born, while only 10 European-born players have been added. The NHL team with the most player inductees is the Toronto Maple Leafs, with 55. Seventy-five defencemen are in the Hall of Fame, more than any other current position, while only 35 goaltenders have been added.

In 1988, a "veteran player category" was established in order to "provide a vehicle for players who may have been overlooked and whose chances for election would be limited when placed on the same ballot with contemporary players." Eleven players were added into the category, but in 2000, the board of directors removed it, and now those inductees are considered to be in the player category.

A. Player was inducted into the Veteran Player category. In 2000, it was merged with the Player category.

The Builder category has been in existence since the beginning of the Hall of Fame and the first builders were added in 1945. A Builder is a person who has contributed to the development of the game of hockey, and as the name refers, one who has built the game forward. Since then, 96 builders have been added. For a person to be added to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder, they may be "active or inactive" and must be nominated by an elected 18-person selection committee. As of 2007, a maximum of two builders can be added in one year.
On March 30, 1993, it was announced that Gil Stein, who at the time was the president of the National Hockey League, had been added into the Hall of Fame. There were immediate allegations that he had engineered his election through manipulation of the hall's board of directors and by telling them to change the rules for selection. Two lawyers, hired by the league to lead an investigation, recommended that Stein's selection be overturned, although it was soon revealed that Stein had previously decided to turn down the induction.

In 1989, Alan Eagleson was added as a builder, but he would resign from the Hall in 1998 after pleading guilty of mail fraud and embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars. His resignation came shortly before a vote was held to expel him.

The On-ice official category has been in existence since 1961 and since then fourteen have been added. For an official to be added to the Hockey Hall of Fame, they must be retired for a minimum of three years and must be nominated by an elected 18-person selection committee. As of 2007, a maximum of one on-ice official can be added in one year.

Female ejaculation

Female ejaculation, also known as gushing or squirting, happens when a woman has an orgasm and clear fluid comes out of her. Scientists are not sure how the fluid is produced, but think it is produced by the Skene's glands (also called the paraurethral glands or female prostate). Female ejaculation was mentioned in ancient times by the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 B.C.), and by doctors and people who study anatomy. However, in much of the 20th century there were people who did not believe that female ejaculation existed, and it was not studied in detail. More people found out about the matter after a book called "The G Spot" came out in 1982 and became popular. After that, more research was done on female ejaculation.

The Kupferhof Bauschenberg was a brass producing factory built in the 17th century in the German city of Stolberg. It had a great influence on the brass industry which made Stolberg world leader in brass production for more than a century.

Due to the excellent conditions for the production of the alloy brass there could hardly be a better place to choose than Stolberg. Located near the small river Vichtbach the water wheels could easily be powerded. Calamine was delivered by the oar mines from nearby Breinigerberg and wood for firing the furnaces had been available in adequate quantities in the forests of the Eifel. This must be the reason why Gottfried Schardinel, one of the richest persons at that time in the region of Stolberg built the Kupferhof Bauschenberg. 

Later the three factories Kupferhof Bauschenberg, Dollartshammer as well as Straßburger Hof fusionated to create the company Prym.

Zira () was one of the two tehsils of the Punjab, (the other one being Ferozpur), that was part of a controversy during the Partition of India. Sir Cyril Radcliffe created the boundary between India and Pakistan just days before the partition. A draft of the Award was supposedly sent to Evan Jenkins, the provincial governor of Punjab by George Abell, Lord Mountbatten’s private secretary, with a preliminary description of the Punjab boundary. This draft showed the Ferozepur and Zira tehsils being allotted to Pakistan.

The final version of the boundary however awarded the areas to India. This led Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, to proclaim that the Award of the Boundary Commission was unjust, incomprehensible and perverse. He, however, agreed to abide by it. The dispute was settled in 1960 as part of an agreement between the governments of India and Pakistan.

Sturgeon is common name are some 26 species of fish in the family Acipenseridae.

These "living fossils" of fish evolution once ranged widely throughout the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the Hudson River. Occasionally, the lake sturgeon's dark form can be discerned in reedy shallows or near river mouths. The glimpse is as rare as it is startling.

In the last century, this large was often regarded as a nuisance because it became entangled in and ripped commercial fishing nets. Only later did the sturgeon become prized for its meat, eggs (caviar) and oil. A gelatin from the inner lining of its air bladder was used to make isinglass--a substance used as a clarifying agent in jellies, glues and in the isinglass windows of carriages and early cars.

Higher education

The expression higher education talks about the educational process, the centers and the institutions that are after the secondary education. In it a higher degree (or title) can be obtained.

Generally, to be 18 years old as a minimum is needed in order to have the right to enter to any higher education. That supposes as if completed the primary education and the secondary education before entering. It is common that there exist ways of selection or some exams of selection of the candidates based on the abilities or preparation of the secondary school. According to the country, these examinations can be of state, local or university conditions and area. In other systems no type of selection exists. It is possible to give also an attention that more and more institutions of higher education allow, or they same encourage the right to enter of adult people that had not been necessarily successful in the secondary education; this is applied especially to the open universities.

The preparation that offers the higher education is of professional or academic type. It is distinguished among studies of predegree, degree (university career) and graduate (master and doctorate) according to the system of professional degree and academic degrees. The establishments of higher education were traditionally the universities, but in addition other educational centers are considered: institutes, centers of formation of the teaching staff, academies of fine arts, conservatories, polytechnics, etc. (The names depend particularly on the educational system of the country).

An important function, aside from education, in the higher education are the activities of research (especially to the universities) in the different levels of the knowledge. Another important function is which corresponds to extension activities, in which the participation of the population is obtained and the results are communicated.

The importance of the higher education in the society changes according to the culture of the country; for example, in many countries of the south of Europe is understood that the student goes to the university to obtain a diploma that will assure him a good work, whereas in several countries of the north of Europe the period of studies in the university is also a moment in which the student learns to be autonomous emotionally and economically, they learn to mix themselves with people of different origins, and if develop as the persons. In these countries, the student rather in a city far from his hometown.

Josip Broz Tito

Josip Broz, nicknamed Tito, (25 May 1892 – 4 May 1980) was a politician: he ruled Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a dictator in office of prime minister from 1945 to 1953 and "president for life" from 1953 to 1980.

Broz studied in elementary school until 1905 at his birth village. In 1907 he was machinist's apprentice in Sisak. In 1910 he joined the union of workers and social-democratic party of Croatia and Slavonia. In 1913 he entered the Austro–Hungarian Army and later was imprisoned for anti war propaganda. During World War I he was wounded, captured, then imprisoned by Russians. Later he was freed by riot workers and he was engaged in bolshevik movement so was a propagandist. After October Revolution, he joined Red Guards (Russia). In 1920 Broz came back to new nation Yugoslavia and joined Communist party which was renamed Yugoslav Communist League in 1952 and he was solo leader from 1937 until his death. In 1921 Yugoslav communist party was banned so Broz was imprisoned from 1928 until 1933 then in 1934 he came back to Soviet Union and he was involved as secret agent in NKVD.

In 1937 Broz came back to Yugoslavia and during World War II he, total supported by Anglo-Americans and Soviet armies, organized People's Liberation Army against the Axis powers and in civil war against Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland, Serbian State Guards, Croatian Home Guard, Slovene Home Guard. In 1945, Broz ordered the end of the "Kingdom of Yugoslavia" and created the "Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia" with six republics: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia, and two autonomous provinces in Serbia: Vojvodina in the north, and Kosovo, next to Albania.

Tito with communist dictatorship, dramatically supported by spy ring OZNA and political police UDBA, ruled Yugoslav Republic from 1945 to 1980: he banned monarchy and all democrat parties.He with other political personalities started Non-Aligned Movement. When he died the political situation was controlled by other chiefs of communist party. Later situation led to the break up of this Balkan country, and wars in Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia and Slovenia during the 1990s.

Accusations of culpability are related with crimes perpetrated during WW II and during repression by Broz Tito's communist Yugoslav Republic command such as massacres of Foibe and Kočevski Rog butchery.Mass graves are evidences of massacres;accusations of genocide and ethnic cleansing by historians.Accusations of culpability in the Bleiburg massacre, the repression of Croatia Catholic's Church, and the crackdown on the Croatian Spring or MASPOK.
Accusation of Vojvodina massacre consists in retaliation against Germans and Hungarians citizen and supposed Chetnik Serbs but some historians consider these incidents also ethnic cleansing against Germans and Hungarians because during World War II, the German minority in occupied Yugoslavia enjoyed a status of superiority over the Yugoslav population.
The AVNOJ Presidium issued a decree that ordered the government confiscation of all property of Nazi Germany and its citizens in Yugoslavia, persons of German nationality (regardless of citizenship), and collaborators. The decision acquired the force of law on February 6, 1945.Other accusation of crimes committed against children.

Broz Tito's repression involved many dictator's old friends such as Milovan Dilas and Vladimir Dedijer who both were imprisoned but later wrote several books with gross accusations against him;criticismn heaped on Broz Tito's lustful lifestyle: by 1974 he had 32 official residences, one of the ten richest men in the Balkans, "a communist who lived like a king".Broz Tito constructed huge personality cult around him.

The show addressed several topical issues like date rape, alcoholism, domestic violence, gay rights, drug abuse, teenage suicide, AIDS, and teenage pregnancy.

Panic attack

Panic attacks are sudden, discrete periods of intense anxiety, mounting physiological arousal, fear, stomach problems (spastic colon) and discomfort that are associated with a variety of somatic and cognitive symptoms. The onset of these episodes is typically abrupt, and may have no obvious triggers. Although these episodes may appear random, they are a subset of an evolutionary response commonly referred to as fight or flight that occur out of context. This response floods the body with hormones, particularly epinephrine (adrenaline), that aid in defending itself from harm. Experiencing a panic attack is said to be one of the most intensely frightening, upsetting and uncomfortable experiences of a person's life. 

According to the American Psychological Association the symptoms of a panic attack commonly last approximately ten minutes. However, panic attacks can be as short as 1–5 minutes, while sometimes panic attacks may form a cyclic series of episodes, lasting for an extended period, sometimes hours. Often those afflicted will experience significant "anticipatory anxiety" and limited symptom attacks in between attacks, in situations where attacks have previously occurred, and in situations where they feel "trapped". That is, where escape would be obvious and/or embarrassing.

Panic attacks also affect people differently. Experienced sufferers may be able to completely "ride out" a panic attack with little to no obvious symptoms or external manifestations. Others, notably first-time sufferers, may even call for emergency services; many who experience a panic attack for the first time fear they are having a heart attack or a nervous breakdown.

Telegraph

Telegraphy (from the Greek words "tele (τηλε)" = far and "graphein (γραφειν)" = write) is the long-distance transmission of written messages without physical transport of letters.

A telegraph sends electric pulses in a special code, composed from short and large marks. Usually, amateur radio operators use Morse code. 

Some of the first telegraphs were made in the late 1700s, but these were hard to use because they had too many wires. Samuel Morse was the first person to make a telegraph using only one wire. In 1844, he built a telegraph line that went from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., and soon, there were telegraphs all over the United States. This made it easier for people to talk to people far away and made it easier for people to move out West.

People would send messages called "telegrams" to other people. They would give the message to somebody using a telegraph, who would send the message using Morse code. Somebody using a telegraph on the other end would write down the message and give it to the person receiving the message. After the 1930s, it became cheaper to make long-distance telephone calls than to send telegrams, so fewer telegrams were sent. Western Union, an American company that used to send telegrams, sent its last telegram in 2006.

Telegraphs are not used as much as they used to be. This is because of newer kinds of technology that people can use to communicate, such as the telephone and the Internet.

The Sperm Whale ("Physeter catodon") is the largest toothed whale. The Sperm whale has the biggest head of any animal; it can be about 20 feet long (6 m), and is about one-third of the whale's body. Its lower jaw is small and contains its huge, conical teeth (which fit into sockets in the upper jaw).

Sperm whales are carnivores (meat-eaters) that mostly hunt medium-sized squid. They also eat many kinds of fish such as Skate, and sometimes they will hunt giant squid that live on the ocean bottom at great depths. The largest bulls (males) will sometimes even eat Colossal Squid.

Like other toothed whales, the Sperm Whale uses echolocation, a way of sensing in which they emit high-pitched clicks and sense them as they bounce back off objects (like prey). This is crucial in hunting in the dark ocean depths.

Samuel

Samuel was a Jewish priest, prophet, and judge over Israel in the Old Testament. He is found in 1 Samuel. His name suggests "Heard of God" (1 Samuel 1:20).

We cannot be sure when exactly Samuel was born . However, we do know that his father was "a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite." His mother was Hannah. Hannah did not have any children, but Elkanah's other wife, Peninnah, had children, and this made her so sad she wept. Hannah prayed to God, "O Lord Almighty...if you will only...remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the Lord for all the days of his life..." God gave her a son, and naming him Samuel, she kept her promise to God by giving him to the Lord (making him serve in the temple). There, "...the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the Lord." At that time there was a priest named Eli: his sons were not good and sinned, but Samuel "...continued to grow in stature (height) and in favor with the Lord and with men." 

One day, when Samuel was a young boy still in the temple, he heard someone calling. He thought it was Eli, but Eli told him that God was talking to him. So Samuel went back and listened, and when he heard God calling, "Samuel! Samuel!" he said, "Speak (talk), for your servant is listening." Then the Lord told Samuel that he would destroy Eli's family because of Eli's sinful sons. Samuel told everything to Eli, and "...all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized {realized) that Samuel was...a prophet of the Lord. The Lord...revealed himself to Samuel through his word." 

Samuel made the people in Israel be sorry for their sins until he died. He also both Saul and David, Israel's first two kings, and also told Israel what the new order of God was when kings began ruling over Israel.

Saul

Saul (שאול המלך) (or Sha'ul) () (reigned 1047 BC - 1007 BC) is a King in the Books of Samuel, 1 Chronicles and the Qur'an. He was the first king of the ancient Israel.

He loved and obeyed God until he stopped listening to God and became slightly greedy, losing God's whole interest for him. Samuel, the prophet comes and rebukes him, and gives him a warning that God is not with him anymore. When turning to leave, Saul grabs Samuel's cloak, and it tears. Samuel says (1Samuel15:28~29), "The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors - to one better than you. He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a man, that he should chang his mind."

Then the spirit of the Lord departs from Saul, and an evil spirit torments him. Saul takes in David the sheperd, and the youngest son of Jesse, into his service to play a harp for him and so that he would be soothed when the evil spirit rests upon him. Later he gets jealous of David, and begins to suspect David as the 'one of your neighbors' that Samuel had mentioned. He grows afraid of David, and finally his jealousy turns to hatred, and he wishes to kill him. But Saul's son Jonathan is bound to David in friendship,which makes his anger fume on Jonathan as well.

Later, Saul dies at the battle against the Philistines,and falls on his own sword because he does not want to be abused by the 'uncircumcised' Philistines.

Judas Iscariot (last name means man of Kerioth) was one of the original disciples of Jesus. He is found in all four gospels of the New Testament. He is described as having betrayed Jesus for money, then killing himself. He is said to have been the treasurer for the apostles.

Even though he was one of Jesus' disciples, he helped the chief priests arrest Jesus. Then those priests told the Roman governor to kill Jesus. The priests paid Judas thirty pieces of silver for his help. Later; due to great sense of guilt for betraying Jesus, Judas tried to give back the silver. When he was unable to undo when he has done, he committed suicide.

At the last supper, Jesus told his disciples that one of them would betray him. Matthew and Luke write that Jesus implied that it was Judas.

While Jesus was praying on the Mount of Olives, Judas brought the priests and their men to him. Then he kissed Jesus, so that the priests could know who he was. Then the priests took Jesus away to be killed. The priests gave Judas money for helping them.

The Gospel of Matthew states that Judas was sorry that he helped kill Jesus. He tried to give the money back to the priests, but they said it was illegal. So Judas threw the money into the temple, and then hanged himself. Then the priests used the money to buy a graveyard for strangers.

In the book of Acts, Judas used the money to buy a field for himself, but died there quickly. After Judas died, the other disciples chose a man named Matthias to take his place as a new disciple in the group of 12.

The following people were the other apostles of Jesus:

Pin stripes

Pin stripes are a pattern of very thin stripes running in parallel found in cloth. 

Although pin stripes are found in mostly in men's suits, any type of fabric can be pin striped. In baseball, the Chicago Cubs baseball uniforms have had pin stripes since 1907 and they are recognized as the first Major League Baseball team to have pin striping onto a baseball uniform. Many other Major League Baseball teams like the Montreal Expos and New York Yankees later put pin stripes on their own uniforms.

Baseball park

A baseball park, baseball stadium, or ball park / ballpark is the field of play in the game of baseball and the spectator seating areas (if any) and any other things added to it.

The flexible rules about baseball fields (aside from the rigid rules of sizes of basepaths and pitcher's mound) allow ballparks to have their own character and quirks. This happens at all levels of baseball, amateur and professional, in many cities and towns where the game is played.

Child soldier

A child soldier is a child that takes part to actively fight in a war. There is no official definition. The Coalition to stop the use of Child Soldiers says that no one less that 18 years old should be recruited by regular or auxiliary troops. The age limit of 18 years is taken from the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 

UNICEF, terre des hommes and Amnesty International see all the combatants and their helpers that are below 18 years of age as "child soldiers". 

There is a problem, however. If such children were classified as Combatants, this would permit to fight against children in wars. On the other hand, if such children were captured, they would then have to be treated according to the Geneva Conventions as "prisoners of war".

The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court says that recruiting people below the age of 15 is a war crime, and must be prosecuted. Thomas Lubanga is currently being tried for this crime at the court in Den Haag. 

According to an UN source, 300.000 children were actively participating in armed conflicts, in 1996.

Young Artist Award

The Young Artist Award (first known as the Youth In Film Award) is an award given by the Young Artist Foundation. It was started in 1978 to award child actors and singers under the age of 18 for their work in film, TV, theater and music, and to raise money for talented children to go to school. 

The first Youth In Film Awards were given in November 1979, at the Sheraton Universal Hotel in Hollywood for child actors' and singers' work during the years 1978 and 1979. The most recent 32nd Young Artist Awards were given on March 13, 2011 at the Sportsmen's Lodge for child actors' work during the year 2010.

The Young Artist Foundation is a charity started in 1978 by Hollywood Foreign Press member, Maureen Dragone to raise money for child artists to go to special schools to study acting, singing, or other special arts. One of the most well known contributors to give money to the Young Artist Foundation is the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. 

The Young Artist Awards are given every year by the Young Artist Foundation. The awards were called the Youth In Film Awards for the first 20 years, but the name was changed to the Young Artist Awards for the 21st awards in March 2000. The awards are sometimes called the "Kiddie Oscars", because many people believe they are like the Academy Awards for children working in Hollywood.

The awards were started by Maureen Dragone in 1979 to award child actors and singers for their work during the years 1978 and 1979 because she thought child actors didn't have a fair chance to win other awards given to adults like the Academy Award and the Golden Globe Award. Two child actors who had to compete with adults for other awards that year were Ricky Schroder in "The Champ" and Justin Henry in "Kramer vs. Kramer". The awards ceremony was held in November or December for the first 10 years, but the ceremony is now held in March or April.

The first Youth In Film Award was a small statue that looked like a small Academy Award. It was a statue of a small golden man holding a wreath in front of his chest and he stood on a very large base that looked like a sports trophy. The new Young Artist Award statue still looks like a small Academy Award, but now the small golden man holds a star over his head and he stands on a much smaller base that is much easier for small children to hold. All the winners are given the golden statue and all the children who are nominated are given a special plaque at the ceremony to remember their nomination.

The children that the Young Artist Awards considers nominating are first suggested by the child's agent or manager and must be suggested before February. A month later, the Young Artist Awards throws a special party to announce the names of the children who they have decided to nominate. The Youth In Film Awards were originally given to young artists up to the age of 21, but the awards are now given to children under the age of 18 most of the time. 

Winners are chosen by the Young Artist Association. The association was originally called the Hollywood Women's Photo and Press Club and its members were 88 journalists and photographers who worked in the arts. Today, the Young Artist Association has over 125 members who are journalists, agents, and former child performers. The winners are picked by The Young Artist Association and past nominees who all vote by secret ballot.

The first Youth In Film Awards gave awards in 11 competitive categories in 1979. The first categories for child artists were "Best Juvenile Actor and Actress in a Motion Picture", "Best Juvenile Actor and Actress in a TV Series or Special", "Best Juvenile Actor and Actress in a Daytime TV Series", and "Best Male and Female Juvenile Recording Artist". The Youth In Film Awards also gave awards to studios and networks in competitive categories for family friendly films and television shows. 

Today, the number of categories has grown to award "Best Young Actor and Actress in an International Feature Film", "Best Young Actor and Actress in a Short Film", "Best Young Supporting Actor and Actress in Film", "Best Young Ensemble Cast", "Best Young Recurring Actor and Actress in a TV Series", and "Best Young Guest-starring Actor and Actress in a TV Series". Many of the categories have been split to award children age 10 and under in their own separate categories. The Young Artist Awards has also awarded children for their work in other arts over the years, including theater, dance, commercials, journalism, radio and stand-up comedy.

While the number of acting categories has grown, some competitive categories like "Best Juvenile Recording Artist", "Best Family Motion Picture" and "Best Family TV Series" are no longer awarded. The awards for those categories are now given as special "Honorary" awards. The most well known Young Artist Honorary Awards are the "Jackie Coogan Award", which is given to film studios, producers or directors for their "Outstanding Contribution To Youth Through Entertainment", and the "Former Child Star Award", which is given as a "Lifetime Achievement Award" to adults who were once child stars.

The ceremony is held every year in Hollywood and is the most formal awards ceremony for children. The child nominees and their parents are expected to "dress up" in suits or party dresses, and many arrive in limousines. Reporters and photographers are invited to the red carpet before the show, to take pictures of the child stars when they arrive and and sign autographs. The children chosen to announce the awards on stage each year are usually the winners from the year before or from the year's list of nominees. After the ceremony is a formal dinner and then dancing with live music performed by popular child singers.

The first Youth In Film Awards were given in November 1979 at a ceremony held at the Sheraton Universal Hotel in Hollywood, California. Other locations for the ceremony over the years are the Ambassador Hotel's Coconut Grove, the Globe Theatre, the Beverly Garland Hotel, and the Sportsmen's Lodge.

Batting order (baseball)

The batting order, or batting lineup, in baseball is an when nine members of the offense take their turns in batting against the pitcher in an order. The batting order is decided by the manager before the game begins, although sometimes during games, a player substitutes with another player which makes the take the original player's spoy. If a team bats out of order, it is a violation of baseball's rules and subject to penalty. When the whole batting order makes plate appearances (bats against the pitcher) in a single inning, it is called "batting around."

In modern American baseball, some batting positions have nicknames: "leadoff" for first, "cleanup" for fourth, and "last" for ninth. Others are known only by the ordinal numbers.

Hammerhead shark of the genus "Sphyrna" are members of the family Sphyrnidae. There are 9 species of hammerhead sharks, ranging in size from about 3 feet (0.9 m) long to over 20 feet (6 m).
The hammerhead shark has a wide, thick, flat head with the eyes on the outer edges of the head. The head is indented at the center of the "hammer," which is almost rectangular in shape. This head helps hammerhead sharks make very tight turns in the water, and it also helps them sense prey.
This shark is gray (sometimes brown) above with an off-white belly. The first dorsal fin (the large fin on the top of the shark that most people associate with sharks) is very large and pointed.

The great hammerhead is a fierce with a good sense of smell that helps it find its prey. The great hammerhead eats fish, including rays, and other sharks, squid, octopuses, and crustaceans. The great hammerhead has been known to be cannibalistic (it eats other hammerhead sharks).

The hammerhead swims in warm and relatively warm water along the coastlines.

The New York Islanders won their fourth Stanley Cup in a row by beating the Edmonton Oilers four games to none. No team in any major professional North American sport has won four championships in a row since the Islanders.

The Boston Bruins led the league in total points with 110. The defending Stanley Cup champion New York Islanders went from first overall and finished tied for 6th overall. The high-scoring Edmonton Oilers tied for second overall. The Oilers set a new record, which they had just set the previous year, for most goals in a season with 424. They were led by Wayne Gretzky, who had 196 points. The Oilers also tied the Boston Bruins' 1971 record for most 100-point players in one season as Wayne Gretzky, Glenn Anderson, Jari Kurri, and Mark Messier all had more than 100 points.

Beluga whale

The beluga whale ("Delphinapterus leucas") is a small, toothed whale that is white as an adult. They are found in coastal areas of the Arctic Ocean, and travel south when the sea ice forms.

The beluga's body is stout and has a small, blunt head with a small beak, tiny eyes, and thick layers of blubber. On their head they have a round shape called the melon. This melon holds oil, and the whale is able to change its shape. Scientists believe that it has something to do with the whale's echolocation system. They have one blowhole. Beluga means "white one" in Russian. Its genus Delphinapterus, means "whale without fins", and the species, "leucas", means "white". The beluga is also called the white whale, the white porpoise, the sea canary (because of its songs), and the squid hound (due to its diet). Unlike most other cetaceans, the beluga's seven neck vertebrae are not fused, giving it a flexible, well-defined neck.

A baby beluga whale, called a calf, is a grey or even brown color when it is born. It will gradually become white over the next five years as it becomes an adult. They grow up to in length and weigh up to . They live for between 35 to 50 years of age. A female beluga whale will have one calf every 3 or 4 years. These are born near the coast, often near the entrance to large rivers. The calfs are fed on milk which is 30% fat.

The beluga whales live in groups, called pods of anywhere from only three whales to large groups of more than 200. they can dive down to depths of and stay underwater for as long as 25 minutes. Polar bears and killer whales are known to hunt beluga whales.

Belugas are toothed whales with 34 teeth. The teeth are not designed for chewing, but for grabbing and tearing prey. They swallow their prey whole. They are opportunistic feeders, eating a varied diet of fish, squid, crustaceans, octopi, and worms. They are both benthic (bottom) and pelagic (oceanic) feeders (in shallow water). Belugas sometimes hunt schools of fish cooperatively in small groups.

David

David (meaning favorite) was an important King of Israel. He is described in the Old Testament books of 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel. He was the father of King Solomon, and an ancestor of Jesus.

David was the youngest of eight sons of Jesse, and the grandson of Ruth (Ruth 4: 17, 22). He was a shepherd, like his father was. While taking care of the sheep, he would use a sling to keep wild animals from hurting them. He would also play his harp. And he wrote many of the songs found in the book of Psalms.

When King Saul, the first King of Israel, left the Lord, God sent an evil spirit in him to torment him.
He called David, the shepherd, to his palace because David was good at playing the harp, and the soft music soothed Saul when he was being tormented by the evil sprit. Saul "liked him very much, and David became one of his armor-bearers." So, "...whenever the spirit from God came upon Saul, David would take his harp and play. Then relief would come to Saul; he would feel better, and the evil spirit would leave him." He unknowingly puts in his court the person God chose to replace him.

When David was about twelve years old, his brothers had to go fight for Israel, under the leadership of King Saul. His father was worried about them, and sent David to check on them. When David arrived, a giant Philistine enemy, Goliath, was mocking the Israelites and God, saying, “Who will come and fight me? If he wins, we will be your slaves, but if I win, then you will be our slaves!” All the Israelites were afraid. When David saw this, he was very angry, and he said, “I will go fight him!”
His faith was very different from King Saul, who, not thinking about God, immediately said, "You are not able...you are only a boy..." But David said confidently, "The Lord who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver (save) me from the hand of this Philistine." He was not confident of his own fighting skills, but of the power of God, whose honor has been hurt by the Philistines and whose covenant promises have been forgotten by the Israelites. When King Saul saw that David was brave enough to fight Goliath, he sent him. Now he not only needed David for his (to keep him from being crazy) but also to protect his kingdom. Saul gave David his armour and weapons, but they were too heavy for him. David told Saul that he would use his slingshot instead. He then used a smooth stone and hit Goliath in the forehead, killing him instantly. Using Goliath’s own sword, David cut off Goliath's head.

Later, because of David's excellent fighting skills and brave loyalty to God, King Saul appoints David in a high rank in the army. Whenever David goes out to slay, he comes back in victory; and therefore all the people were pleased with him, and King Saul treasured him very much. But one day, when King Saul was coming out to greet his people, the women of the town came out, singing and dancing, with tamberines and lutes. And as they danced, they sang the famous song, that most Christians know well:
<poem>
"Saul has slain his thousands,
and David his tens of thousands."
</poem>
Saul, hearing this song, burst with fury and jealousy - and began to suspect that the people liked David more than him.

Saul's jealousy then began to heat into hatred, and he wanted to kill David, but not yet with his own hand - and so he asked David to marry his daughter, Merab, but David refused politely, and Merab was married to Adriel of Meholah. Then he asked, again, for David to marry Michal, who was in love with David. David again refused. Finally, he asked him to bring a hundred Philistine foreskins, and then he would give the bride over. David was pleased to become Saul's son-in-law when he heard this, and agreed. Saul thought, "Now he will be killed by the Philistine's hand!" But God was with David, and he was not hurt. Saul tells Jonathan and all the officials to kill David, but Jonathan loved David very much (and had made a of friendship with him), and warned Saul not to. Saul listened, but later he grew angry again, and keeps on trying to kill David. Many times David does not kill Saul when he has a chance to, but instead says, "How can I kill the Lord's anointed?" and spares Saul, and many times Saul blesses David and repents, and determines to stop trying to kill David - but he always returns with a spear.

In battle with the Philistines, Saul's sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua are killed (the surviving son, Ish-Bosheth or Esh-Baal, was later made king by Abner). Saul is injured, and he said to his armor-bearer to kill him before "...these uncircumcised fellows will come and run me through and abuse me." The armor-bearer is too afraid to do it, so Saul "...took his own sword and fell on it", killing himself. The armor-bearer killed himself, too. "So Saul and his three sons and his armor-bearer and all his men died together that same day." 

An Amalekite came to David and lied that he had killed Saul, probably hoping that David would reward him. David realizes that Saul is dead, and he ripped his clothes and wept. He was not happy to hear that Saul was dead, and even killed the Amalekite, thinking that he was Saul's murderer. He was anointed again in front of everybody.

Meanwhile, Ish-Bosheth, the only son of Saul left, was made king by Abner, a relative of Saul. "The war between the house of Saul and the house of David lasted a long time. David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.", Later, Abner slept with one of Saul's concubines, and Ish-Bosheth asked, "Why did you sleep with my father's concubine?" Ish-Bosheth suspected that Abner wanted to be king instead of him (sleeping with the concubine of a king was thought very important). Abner became very angry and decided to help David instead. However, Joab, the commander of David's army, did not like Abner because Abner had killed his brother. Maybe he also thought his job as the leader of the army would not be safe if Abner helped David, because Abner was very powerful in the northern tribes of Israel. So, Joab killed him by him in the stomach. David cursed Joab for murdering Abner and said that he did not join in the killing.

When Ish-Bosheth heard that Abner had died, he became very worried: the northern tribes were now without a strong leader. Two men, Recab and his brother Baanah, killed Ish-Bosheth in his house and brought his head to David, saying, "This day the LORD has avenged my lord the king against Saul." David was very angry, and killed them: cutting off the hands that had killed Ish-Bosheth and the feet that had run with the news. They buried the head of Ish-Bosheth in Abner's tomb.

All the tribes of Israel then came to David and made him king over Israel.

A few years after David had captured Jerusalem, he asked, "Is there anyone...to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan's sake?" remembering the promise he had made. They found a servant of King Saul named Ziba, who said that there was still a son of Jonathan who was in both feet named Mephibosheth. David told Mephibosheth that he would get back all the land Saul had when he was king, and that Mephibosheth would always eat at his table - a mark of great honor. Mephibosheth bowed down and cried, "What is your servant, that you should notice a dead dog like me?" From then on, Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem and always ate at the king's table like one of David's sons.

One day, David was walking around on the roof of his palace when he saw a very beautiful woman bathing. David found out that her name was Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite, who was one of David's royal guards. David "sent messengers to get her...and he slept with her." Because of this, David eventually broke the sixth, seventh, ninth and tenth commandments She soon became pregnant. The law said that both David and Bathsheba must die for their sin. David makes Uriah come back from battle and tried to make him go back home and sleep with Bathsheba, so everybody will think it is Bathsheba's son. But Uriah does not go home, saying, "The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tents...How could I go to my house...and lie with my wife?" His shows how sinful David is. Finally, when David could not make him go home, he decided to make Uriah die so he could marry Bathsheba himself quickly. He said, "Put Uriah in the front line where the fighting is . Then withdraw (go away) from him so he will be struck down and die." Because of this, Uriah died.

David married Bathsheba, but "...the thing David had done displeased the LORD." So, Nathan the prophet went and told him that he had done a very bad sin. David saw he was guilty and was very sorry. He said, "I have sinned against the Lord." Nathan told David that he was forgiven, and the LORD did not make David die, as the law said he must. However, Nathan said the son Bathsheba would give birth to would die. After Nathan had gone home, the child became sick and died. David was very sad, but humbly accepted the results of his sin. Bathsheba had another son, and they named him Solomon. The LORD loved him, and said to name him Jedidah (it means "loved by the LORD") This name showed that the LORD loved Solomon from when he was born, and also showed that the LORD still loved David, even though he had sinned.

I think we should use subpages for RfD threads, which are then transcluded on the main RfD page (like on the English Wikipedia). It would make archiving and finding deletion discussions a lot more convenient and efficient. Any objections?-- 11:48, 18 July 2008 (UTC)

Hello community; Our current GA and VGA have some criteria they must meet, before they can be promoted to the respective level. One of them reads:

It is item number 3 in the GA criteria, and number 4 for the VGA criteria. Discussions and have raised doubts of how this should be interpreted; and that it should perhaps be re-worded or deleted. The original discussion can be found . The idea at the time was to require several edits (in the form of a review or ipmrovement process), but to make the different editors part optional. It looks like current interpretation seems to be to "require" the different editor part (By interpreting "No one writes perfect articles" as "No single person writers perfect articles", and then taking that as strengthening the "different editors" part). In any case, I hereby opened the can of worms. -- () 10:40, 27 June 2008 (UTC)





Several years ago, when the English Wikipedia was relatively new, someone created a bot that created new articles for every county, city, and town in the United States and possibly in other countries as well. It automatically retrieved demographic information from census websites and put that information into sentences. I mention this because, in my opinion, the Simple English Wikipedia is severely lacking when it comes to information on counties, cities, towns, and other political jurisdictions. Someone who knew what they were doing could make a bot that could quickly create these articles, making the demographics much easier to understand than they are in normal English. It would also get the ball rolling so other users could flesh these articles out. Anyone with me here? -- () 11:09, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

While we are at i,t the VGA criteria (item 2) say 
Just a very basic question: Given that our average editor does not know everything on every possible subject, it will be very difficult to decide if a particular article is missing anything. How could we change the requirement that it becomes easier to handle. Dropping it is not an option, because the original VGA criteria did not have it; look at some of the to see why. -- () 12:43, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

Can an available admin please fulfill this request? Thanks! 13:42, 27 June 2008 (UTC)
Following the recent discussion about image censorship, I created page. Please update it as required. 17:47, Friday, June 27 2008 Utc

The recent changes page cannot be edited anymore, can some admin kindly delete the articles that are already created, removing them from the "most wanted" list? These articles are now striked off, instead of deleted completely. I don't have permission. () 10:13, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

I made a small mention of this in an earlier section, but I wonder if "disambiguation" is a very good name for such pages as "ambiguous" is not really Simple English and Basic English says opposites should be made with "un-". It looks like this was talked about two or three years ago on , but no agreement was reached. Does anyone else think the name could be better, and what could it be? () 00:54, 29 June 2008 (UTC)

On words with more than one meaning you are redirected to a page called, for example, "Example (disambiguation)". To keep with Simple English, I would suggest "Example (List of meanings)" or "Example (Words with many meanings)" ~ .. 03:41, 26 October 2008 (UTC)

Would someone with experience in HotCat please explain how to enable my using it. Help? -- 01:32, 30 June 2008 (UTC)

Hey guys. I've noticed that the criteria for GA and VGA are defined as "guidelines" not "policy". This means that "criteria" for good and very good articles aren't really criteria, they're simply suggestions. Is this an area that needs to be tightened up? While we're there we can ditch the pointless "guideline criterion" which says an article needs to be edited by multiple editors. () 17:10, 30 June 2008 (UTC)

I'll be bold: What would change, if the guidelines were policies? - We'd had to go through a vote; with possibly a minimum number of voters, and a minimum percentage of support votes. (Very) Good Arricle is an extra tag that shows an article is about a particular quality; it meets a given standard, and a vote showed that most editors (who voted) are fine with sticking on the tag. Also, if this becomes policy, changing it is more difficult to do; I am fine discussing/adapting the criteria we use for a particular category; Personally, I wouldn't be at ease making this policy. -- () 10:45, 1 July 2008 (UTC)

What's the difference between the template and the template? The Neutrality template seems more simple language, but is there a deep meaning I'm missing. If there is a different, is it too subtle for Simple English? () 05:00, 1 July 2008 (UTC)

Related to the above, the categories for "China" weren't very neutral. I tried to copy English Wikipedia which appears to have come to some sort of compromise. Before the categories may only have favored the views of the People's Republic of China. Anyway, if someone could double check, as I'm not an expert. I just stumbled across it all while categorizing a university article. () 05:00, 1 July 2008 (UTC)

Hiyas all; congratulations to all those who contributed. I have promoted [[Charles Spurgeon]] to VGA status; all 12 votes were in favour of promotion. This shows that the VGA process is not broken; it just needs a lot of work (and of course the right article to work on).

Ecumenical Patriarch

The Ecumenical Patriarch is the Patriarch of Constantinople. Today, Constantinople is called Istanbul. He is regarded to be the leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church. He has been generally known as the "Greek Patriarch of Constantinople". There is also an Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople (which is different). The older of the office is the Archbishop of Constantinople. The office should also not be taken for the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, which no longer exists.

The current Ecumenical Patriarch is Bartholomew I

Orthodox Churches are autocephalous. This means there is a Patriarch for each Church, and there is usually one Church per country. For this reason, the Ecumenical patriarch is primus inter pares ("First among equals").

<doc id="118208" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=118208" title="Assyrian Church of the East">
Assyrian Church of the East

The Assyrian Church of the East also called Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East is a Christian church. It is one of the earliest churches to separate from the larger Church. It traces its origins to the See of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, started by Saint Thomas the Apostle as well as Saint Mari and Addai as shown in the Doctrine of Addai. This church is sometimes known as the "Nestorian Church", the "Syrian Church" or the "Persian Church." The church is currently headed by Mar Dinkha IV. 

Other names have been given as well, but they are not accurate. One of these names is Assyrian Orthodox Church, which has led some people to believe that it is part of the Oriental Orthodox community. The church itself does not use the word "Orthodox" in any of its service books or in any of its official correspondence, nor does it use any word which can be translated as "correct faith" or "correct doctrine", the rough translation of the word Orthodox. In India, it is known as the Chaldean Syrian Church. In the West it is often known as the Nestorian Church. The Church itself believes that the term 'Nestorian Church' is chosen badly. 

The Assyrian Church is the original Christian church in what was once Parthia; eastern Iraq and Iran. Geographically its influence stretched to China and India in the Middle Ages: a monument found in Xi'an (Hsi-an), the Tang-period capital of China (originally Chang'an), in Chinese and Syriac described the activities of the church in the 7th and 8th century, while half a millennium later a Chinese monk went from Beijing to Paris and Rome to call for an alliance with the Mongols against the Mamelukes. Before the Portuguese arrival in India in 1498, it provided "East Syrian" bishops to the Saint Thomas Christians. Patriarch Timothy I (727–823) wrote of the large Christian community in Tibet.

The creators of Assyrian theology are Diodorus of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia. Both taught at Antioch. The normative Christology of the Assyrian church was written by Babai the Great (551–628) and is clearly different from the accusations of dualism directed toward Nestorius: his main christological work is called the 'Book of the Union', and in it Babai teaches that the two "qnome" (essences) are unmingled but everlastingly united in the one "parsopa" (personality) of Christ.

Pidgin (software)

Pidgin (also known as Gaim) is a instant messaging client that can work on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. The software can use most instant messaging protocols, which will let the user log into different instant messaging services from one program.

The number of Pidgin users is thought to be more than 3 million in 2007.
Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, Pidgin is free software.


The program was made in or before 1999 by Mark Spencer, an Auburn University sophomore. It was made to give the features of AOL Instant Messenger for Linux.

The original name was GAIM, which stood for GTK+ AOL Instant Messenger. After pressure from AOL, the program was renamed to gaim.

However, on April 6 2007, the project development team announced the results of their talks with AOL. This included some name changes: "gaim" became "Pidgin", "libgaim" became "libpurple", and "gaim-text" became "finch". 

Due to the legal problems, version 2.0 of the software was stuck in beta stages. Following the talks, it was said that the first official release of Pidgin 2.0.0 was hoped to happen during the two weeks from April 8, 2007. However, Pidgin 2.0 did not release on time, but on April 22, 2007.

Pidgin 2.0.0 was released on May 3, 2007. This was the first version to be called Pidgin. It also contained a completely new graphics design.

Psychotherapy

Psychotherapy describes the way specially skilled people called psychotherapists help people who have problems and unhappiness in their lives or who want to improve the quality of their lives and relationships with others.
Psychotherapy means treatment of the mind. It aims to help the person feel better, be braver, happier and more in control of their lives. The main way they do this is by talking to the person who has the problems in a way that they begin to be able to understand themselves better. A few psychotherapists may also touch the person to help them express how they are feeling. Some psychotherapists may work with a group of people such as a family who have problems and are unhappy.
Psychotherapists usually complete their training at the doctoral level through doctor of philosophy programs or medical school, although, some are trained at the master's level. Psychotherapists do not use surgery, or give drugs or electric shocks to the people they help. These methods are used by special medical doctors called psychiatrists, who may also sometimes give psychotherapy. 
Psychotherapy was started in the west in 1886 by Sigmund Freud who is called "the father of psychoanalysis," the first modern psychotherapy. Freud was a medical doctor who was trained in Neurology. He became certain that hidden thoughts in the brain (which he called The Unconscious) could cause physical symptoms and strange behavior in some people. He believed that human behavior was not all caused by the brain, but by things that happened to people when they were babies and young children. His research of this theory -the idea he had- led him to create "talking therapy" -psychoanalysis- where he tried to figure out what could cause the mind to do things like this. Freud thought that his figuring things out and telling the patients what had caused the behavior would cure the patient. Unfortunately, it usually made no lasting changes. 
This is why modern psychologists (and psychiatrists) have gradually figured out many other ways of helping their patients and modified their techniques through various types of psychotherapy (for example: dynamic psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy).

Trousers (or pants in Canada, South Africa and the United States, and sometimes called slacks or breeches (sometimes )) are a kind of clothing worn on the lower part of the body, covering both legs apart (instead of with cloth stretching across both as in skirts and dresses). Historically, as for the West, trousers have been the lower-body clothing item for males since the 16th century; by the late 20th century, they had become prevalent for females as well. Trousers are worn at the hips or waist, and may be held up by their own by a belt, or suspenders (braces).

Bibliography

Bibliography (Greek βίβλος = book γραφή = write) is the arrangement of printed books and articles according to author or subject, and the publication of lists of titles. Bibliographies are of many different kinds and may be annotated with information about their contents. Bibliographies may be organized in various ways, such as by authors, subjects or date of publication. Bibliographies without annotations are sometimes given the modest title of checklists.

Another meaning of Bibliography is the academic study of books as physical and cultural objects; in this sense, it is also known as bibliology. This kind of bibliography is not concerned with the written content of books, but rather the "bookness" of books-–how they were designed, edited, printed, circulated, reprinted and collected.

Regarding this revision which I moved from Main Page: I strongly object these colors. After several years of web design practice, I would like to say, these high saturated background colors are ok for kids web sites, not for official web sites like Wikipedia. They make text unreadable, they make the web site look too fancy. I suggest using a light background. I will make an example myself in a minute. - 17:44, 28 July 2007 (UTC)

I think this revision is more colorized, yet is not fancy. For black text, we should use light backgrounds (those with low saturated colors). - 17:56, 28 July 2007 (UTC)

I did the copy-paste. - 18:19, 28 July 2007 (UTC)

Oh, I am sorry. I thought you were talking about my revisions. Those WERE hideous. i agree 100 %. I did not do those. Well... I do NOT think it is FANCY ! that is a joke. Simple should be a tad fancy though. 17:11, 29 July 2007 (UTC)

Wait.. PURPLE AGAINST BLUE ! who created taht Main Page ... !!! 

I just did some color changing (). My preference for the selected article section would be something light and kind of pastel so that it fits in with the color scheme for the rest of the page. I think the lilac works nicely because the star is mainly brown and lilac. 

On an unrelated note, I think we should do a vote soon on the layout (horizontal vs. vertical). I'm not entirely opposed to the vertical, I kind of prefer the horizontal though. I think if we stick with the vertical, we should shorten the intro box. Have you seen the changes I made to the header area on the main page ()? I don't want to change it on your test page in case you don't like it. You don't have to keep the color changes I made either--it's your proposal, not mine. I think no matter which layout the community chooses, we should use your process of rotating the articles. I'm envious of people that can do that sort of stuff. · 18:04, 30 July 2007 (UTC)

Hi, anything I can do to help you on this new page? I noticed the Selected article box, what "is" that??<br>
<br>

Can you also add a simple picture to accompany the article, like English wiki? Images help, I think! Thanks. 10:34, 30 July 2007 (UTC)

I put a nice, new pastel on there, but I had to experiment and got that awful purple and the horribly ostentatious canary yellow. I think the top border on the "selected article" box is too big. How do I change that? || | 14:49, 30 July 2007 (UTC)
I see the point you made Tygartl1. Here is my suggestion: We can make the Introduction box green, and use its colors (or a different color group) for Knowledge Groups box. This way, we won't have two orange-based boxes next to each other (as we currently have). What do you think? - 19:50, 2 August 2007 (UTC)

As of this revision I've merged the Introduction and What to do boxes on the left. - 20:57, 2 August 2007 (UTC)

Very nice, Huji. 23:14, 10 August 2007 (UTC)

Hello, looks quite good, at the moment. However in the version I looked at there seems to be quite a bit of space, both at the bottom of "Selected article". What do you think about trying to fill that space, by moving the "Other very good articles" line down a bit? Or is it just me, that sees this space as annoying? - The other things (colors, boxing) look fine to me -- 13:12, 18 August 2007 (UTC)

I changed the heading to match the current main page. For some reason the italics for those links has always bothered me, not to mention that I think the links I have placed there are more useful than the ones I replaced. In my humble opinion, I think this way looks much cleaner and will ultimately be more helpful than the previous heading. One thing that I do not know how to do (but think should be done) is to change the width of the grey box around the Welcome so that it matches the width of the other boxes on the page. Could someone do that? Thanks! · 15:50, 18 August 2007 (UTC)

I've been reading the code for the Very Good Article transclusion, and I think it's flawed, and unnecessarily complex. Generally, Main Pages and Portals simply transclude a summary of rotating content from a previously created subpage, using the formula <nowiki>04 09, 2017</nowiki>. This is also similar to the work involved in maintaining Portals. I believe I've read that we plan to rotate our VG every week, right? I can arrange this format and the code, if you wish. My experience with Portals at EnWP may come handy ;) Love, - 15:25, 19 August 2007 (UTC)

I am yet to finish my Main Page test, and I strongly object to this version of the page ! IM
What is wrong with the page?-- 04:57, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

Because of the large size gap between 1000 articles and 100 000 articles, I rechecked each wiki in that grouping and split it up by adding the 10K+ category to denote medium sized wikis. The 100K, 1K, 100 groupings just seem a little off as they would define Large, Small, and tiny rather than Large, medium and small (and tiny). I also added a separator and centered the footer for that section. The separator helps it stand away from the list of wikis a little and the centering keeps it in the same style as the footer information in the other sections on the page (it was the only one that was aligned right). Revert either or both edits (I made them separated for easier undoing) as needed. -- 06:28, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

I switched to coding for VG article rotation to a once a week rotation. The coding uses CURRENTWEEK rather than CURRENTDAY to base it one a weekly value. It also takes advantage of the mod function (returns the remainder of a number: 32/10 = 3 remainder 2, mod = 2) rather than having to use IF statements to parse out an value for the page name. This shortens the coding and makes it much simplier to vary the number of articles in rotation. Finally it adds 1 to the value so we get a number between 1 and (currently) 10 rather than 0 to 9 so no changes to the Article pages needs to be made. -- 16:38, 23 August 2007 (UTC)

Due to the large number of pages currently used for the main page, categorization was required to consolidate the information. The problem being that the Main Page itself should not have a category. With 10 VG article pages and multiple subpages for the individual boxes on the main page and the test page, a category for all of these pages was needed. The category Main page is being used as the main source of all top level categories. This did not seem the place to include everything for the main page itself. A subcat in cat:wikipedia was probably the best place but of course I just thought of that idea as I was typing this sentence... As such, I placed the pages in the category:Project which is mainly unused as it is the root for all categories and articles combined. To prevent the categories from being transcluded into the main page with the rest of the information, the <nowiki> <noinclude> </nowiki> function was included for the category itself. The test page includes the category directly. As it is not commonly shown, the category is not an issue. Should the test page ever be copied over to the main page again, the category needs to be removed during the transfer to keep the main page nice and clean and category free. -- 06:58, 30 August 2007 (UTC)

With the main page itself being modified to accept information from subpages rather than including all the information on the main page (decreasing the actual size of the page from 16K down to 2K), the current version of the test page was not in sync with the main. To prevent issues with new tweaks here causing problems when transferred to the main page, I updated the test page to the current version of the main page so that any changes here will be easier to copy over should they be needed. -- 06:58, 30 August 2007 (UTC)

The Requiem Mass in D minor K626 is a famous piece of music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart which he composed in 1791. This requiem (a 'requiem' is a mass (church service) to remember people who have died), was Mozart's last composition. He wrote it as he lay dying himself. It seems that he did not manage to finish it before he died, and that it was finished by another musician called Franz Xaver Süssmayr. We do not know exactly how much of the music is by Mozart, and how much Süssmayr had to add. There have been lots of stories and ideas about how the Requiem was composed, and it is still a problem that is often discussed by musicians.

Gregorio Allegri

Gregorio Allegri (born 1582; died February 17, 1652) was an Italian composer and priest. He lived most of his life in Rome, and died there.

He composed a lot of church music. By far the most famous of his compositions is the "Miserere mei, Deus", often just referred to as "Allegri's 'Miserere'". There is a very famous story about this music.

"Miserere mei, Deus" is a motet written to be sung by two choirs, one in which the singers are divided into five groups (five voices) and the other in four groups. One choir sings a simple kind of tune called a fauxbourdon which is based on a plainchant. The other sings a more complicated version, with a top part which goes up to top C (the note two octaves higher than Middle C).

The piece is written in a traditional church style. Allegri had learned composition from a friend of Giovanni da Palestrina, the greatest church composer of the Renaissance. However, the style of Allegri's music is more modern than Palestrina. Allegri was writing in the early Baroque period.

Allegri wrote the "Miserere" to be sung in the Pope's Sistine Chapel. The Vatican did not want anyone else to perform the music, so no one was allowed to take the music away or make copies of it. However, when the 14-year-old Mozart visited the Vatican in 1770 with his father, he heard it twice, went home and wrote all the music out from memory. Mozart's copy of the music was sent to England where it was published by Dr Charles Burney. There were no copyright laws in those days, so there was nothing that the Vatican could do about it.

Chronology is a word meaning 'the study of time'. It comes from the Greek words "chronos" (time) and "logos" (word). The adjective is chronological.

Putting events in chronological order means: listing them in the order in which they happened.

There are many sciences which deal in different ways with chronology. General chronology is sometimes called "periodization". Historical chronology can deal with history or with the geological history of the earth.

When things are put in chronological order it can sometimes be called a "timeline".

<doc id="118333" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=118333" title="Homo floresiensis">
Homo floresiensis

Homo floresiensis ("Flores Man", also called "hobbit") is a possible species ("type") in the genus "Homo", the biological family to which humans belong. The remains were found in 2004 on the island of Flores in Indonesia. Parts of the skeletons of nine individuals were found, including one complete cranium ("the bones that form the head").. The most important and obvious identifying features of "H. floresiensis" are its small body and small size of the space for the brain inside the skull. This is why the discoverers have called members of the species "hobbits", after J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional race of roughly the same height. 

A lot of research is done to find out if they are a different species to modern humans. 
The remains were discovered on the Indonesian island of Flores by an Australian-Indonesian team of archaeologists in 2003. Archaeologist Mike Morwood and colleagues were looking for evidence of the original human migration of "H. sapiens" from Asia to Australia. They were not expecting to find a new species. They were surprised at the recovery of a nearly complete skeleton of a hominin ("the name of the tribe (like a biological familly) to which humans also belong"). They called it LB1 because it was unearthed inside the Liang Bua Cave. Excavations done after that recovered seven additional skeletons, dating from 38,000 to 13,000 years ago. An arm bone which they think belongs to "H. floresiensis" is about 74,000 years old. The specimens are not fossilized and have been described as having "the consistency of wet blotting paper"; once exposed, the bones had to be left to dry before they could be dug up.

Researchers hope to find preserved mitochondrial DNA to compare with samples from similarly unfossilised specimens of "Homo neanderthalensis" and "H. sapiens".

This hominin ("human-like being") is remarkable because it has a small body and brain. 
There are also a lot of stone tools found in the cave. The tools are of a size that could be used by the 1 meter tall human. They are dated from 95,000 to 13,000 years ago. They are found in the same archeological layer as an elephant of the extinct genus "Stegodon". They think that LB1 might have hunted this elephant. The elephant would have been very common throughout Asia during the Quaternary. Other animals that lived on the island at that time were giant rats, Komodo dragons, and even larger species of lizards. "Homo sapiens" reached the region by around 45,000 years ago.

Archaeologist Mike Morwood and colleagues who found the remains published research to say that they think the individuals belong to a new species, "H. floresiensis", within the taxonomic tribe of Hominini. Other members of this tribe are human (the only living member of the genus "Homo"), bonobo (genus "Pan"), and chimpanzee (genus "Pan"); their ancestors; and the extinct line of their common ancestor. The discoverers also say that "H. floresiensis" might have lived at the same time as modern humans ("Homo sapiens") on Flores.

Not everyone agrees that this is a new species. Indonesian anthropologist Teuku Jacob suggested that the skull of LB1 was a modern human with microcephaly. This is a disorder that causes the bones of the head to stop growing. Another study says that perhaps the individuals were born without a working thyroid ("a hormone gland"), which would result in the small size of the hominins because of a disorder called Myxedema, ME.

Two studies of the bones published in 2007 both reported evidence to support species status for "H. floresiensis". A study of three bits of bones from the hand (or "carpal bones") showed that they were similar to the carpal bones of a chimpanzee or an early hominin such as "Australopithecus". They were also different from the bones of modern humans. A study of the bones and joints of the arm, shoulder, and legs also concluded that "H. floresiensis" was more similar to early humans and apes than modern humans. In 2009, the publication of a cladistic analysis and a study comparing body sizes gave further support for the theory that "H. floresiensis" and "Homo sapiens" are separate species.

They believe that the species has survived on Flores at least until 12,000 years before present. This makes it the longest lasting non-modern human. It also lived longer than the Neanderthals ("H. neanderthalensis"), which became extinct about 24,000 years ago.

Because of a deep neighboring strait, Flores remained isolated during the Wisconsin glaciation (the most recent glacial period). Because of this, the discoverers of "H. floresiensis" think that the species, or its ancestors, must have reached the isolated island by water transport around 100,000 years ago (or, if they are "H. erectus", then about 1 million years ago). 

Local geology suggests that a volcanic eruption on Flores approximately 12,000 years ago was responsible for the end of "H. floresiensis" and animals that lived on the island. The elephant "Stegodon" also became extinct at this time. Gregory Forth hypothesized that "H. floresiensis" may have survived longer in other parts of Flores to become the source of the "Ebu Gogo" stories told among the local people. 

The stories say that "Ebu Gogo" were small, hairy, language-poor cave dwellers that are the same size as the Homo Floresiensis. It is said that they were there at the time of the arrival of the first Portuguese ships during the 16th century. These creatures are claimed to have existed as recently as the late 19th century. Gerd van den Bergh, a paleontologist working with the fossils, reported hearing of the Ebu Gogo ten years before the fossil discovery. On the nearby island of Sumatra, there are reports of a 1-1.5m tall humanoid, the Orang Pendek which might be related to "H. floresiensis". Henry Gee, senior editor at "Nature" magazine, speculates that species like H. floresiensis might still exist in the unexplored tropical forest of Indonesia.

Dajabón Province

Dajabón is a Dominican province; it is located in the northwestern part of the country, on the border with Haiti. Its capital city has the same name, Dajabón.

It was created on 1938 with the name Province Libertador. It got its present name in 1961. It was part of the Monte Cristi province before being elevated to the category of province.

Dajabón is bordered to the north by the Monte Cristi province, to the east by the Santiago Rodríguez province and to the south by the Elías Piña province. To the west Dajabón borders the Republic of Haiti.

The province takes the name from the Taíno name of the region, Dahaboon; it was also the name of the main river of the region (the River Dajabón).

For a very long time, very few people lived in this region because it was on the border between two countries: first, between the French colony of "Saint-Domingue" and the Spanish colony of "Santo Domingo" and later between the two independent countries of Haiti and Dominican Republic. There were many fights here between the armies of the two parts of the island and some important battles were held close to the city of Dajabón during the Dominican Independence War.

In 1861, the Dominican Republic became again a colony of Spain. The Restoration War, or just the "Restoration", started on 16 August 1863, in a hill close to Capotillo. The Spanish army left the country in 1865.

After the "Restoration", people came to live in this area and several towns were created.

In 2002 (last national census), there were 62,046 people living in the Dajabón province: 31,443 men and 30,603 women. There were 29,218 (47.09%) living in towns and cities. The population density was 61 persons/km².

The estimated population in the province for 2007 was of 69,736 inhabitants: 35,477 men and 34,259 women, for a population density of 69.11 persons/km².

The following table shows the municipalities with their populations in the 2002 census.

The Dajabón province has a total area of 1,020.73 km². It has 2.1% of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 23rd (out of 31 plus the National District) largest province.

The Cordillera Central ("Central mountain chain") is found in the southern part of the province. The northern part is flat, with many savannas; it is part of the "Yaque del Norte Valley" (or "Línea Noroeste").

There are two main roads in the province. One, from north to south, comes from the Monte Cristi province and goes through the cities of Dajabón, Loma de Cabrera and Restauración and then goes into the Elías Piña province. In some parts, the road marks the border with Haiti.

The second main road begins in Santiago de la Cruz and goes to the east through Partido and El Pino and then through the Santiago Rodríguez and Valverde provinces to end in the "Carretera Duarte" (Duarte National Road), one of the most important road of the country and that goes from Santo Domingo to Monte Cristi.

The only important river in the province is the River Dajabón, also known as "Masacre" (from French "Massacre"). This river marks the Dominican-Haitian border from the city of Dajabón to its mouth. Other rivers are very short and they are tributaries of the Dajabon or the Artibonite rivers.

The climate of the province is a tropical climate, hot most of the year, but it is cooler on the mountains.

There are five municipalities and four municipal districts in the province. The municipal districts are similar to municipalities but they depend on a municipality.

The municipalities and municipal districts (M.D.) are:

As in all provinces on the Dominican Republic-Haiti border, there is little economic development. The trade with Haiti is very important, mostly in the city of Dajabón. On the mountains, coffee and beans are important products. Rice and bananas are produced in the northern part of the province, and cattle raising is important around the city of Dajabón.

Patton (movie)

Patton (UK: Patton: Lust for Glory) is a 1970 movie about United States Army General George S. Patton, and his role in the Second World War. "Patton" starred George C. Scott in the title role, and it was released by 20th Century Fox. The movie became very popular, and won an Academy Award for Best Picture in 1971. A sequel, "The Last Days of Patton", appeared in 1986, also starring Scott.

Patton's widow was approached not long after her husband died (after an automobile accident), with an offer to make a Hollywood movie about Patton's life and career. His family did not agree right away, and it was many years before they approved a dramatic movie to be made. The movie's screenplay was based on a well-written biography of General Patton, "Patton: Ordeal and Triumph", and "A Soldier's Story", a by General Omar N. Bradley, who served with Patton.

The story covers the time from the American defeat at the Battle of the Kasserine Pass in North Africa during 1943, when Patton was sent to take command, through his victories in Africa and Sicily, his time as a "" before D-Day, The Battle of the Bulge, and his last weeks, after the war was over in 1945.

The movie did not give much time to showing combat and battles, but explained Patton's role in several important battles and campaigns. It also showed his character as a person, as a soldier, and as a leader. Patton made good choices, such as appointing Omar Bradley to assist him, and bad choices, such as striking soldiers physically when they showed fear or cowardice, or giving his personal opinions to the media, when they differed widely from what the Allied commanders expected. The movie showed a mix of both bad and good things about Patton.

The movie appeared nearly twenty-five years after Patton died. American attitudes toward war, toward fighting, and toward the military had changed in many ways. The Vietnam War was happening at the same time the movie was made and shown. The older generation, who had fought in World War II or helped out on the , tended to support the war and the draft, which made young American men join the Army to fight. Younger people, who did not remember World War II or were born after it ended, were mostly against the war in Vietnam. "Patton" gave older and younger viewers a look back at an American war hero and leader, and it gave them things to think and talk about together.

Books of Chronicles

The First and Second Chronicles are history books in the Old Testament. They tell the history of Israel differently from the Books of Kings. Using Biblical books (like Samuel and Kings) and other sources, the "Chronicler" encourages the Jews who returned from exile in Babylon. He goes back over Israel's history to explain why they have had all their troubles and how they can live right to become better in the future.

Originally, the First and Second Chronicles were one book. They were later split apart into two different books.

The Hebrew title ("dibre hayyamim") means "what happened in the days (or years)". The Septuagint translators (who translated the Old Testament into Greek) called the book "the things ". This showed that they thought of it as an addition to Samuel and Kings. Jerome (A.D. 347–420), who translated the Latin Vulgate, said that a better title would be "chronicle of the whole sacred history". Luther used this idea in his German version, and others have followed him. Chronicles was first divided into two books by the Septuagint translators.

Old Jewish tradition says that Ezra wrote Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah. However, people are still not sure. Many people say that Chronicles was written in the later half of the 5th century B.C..

In the game, you play as a small human-like being, who is a prince. His father is the king of the cosmos. In the beginning, the king destroys all of the stars in the galaxy without meaning to do so. He then asks his son to take a magic ball (the Katamari). The king then sends the prince to Earth. The ball can make things stick to it. The point of the game is to roll enough things onto the ball. Once this limit is reached, the Katamari is sent to the king for evaluation. If it is big enough, the ball will float into the air and turn into a star.

The game got really good ratings. IGN rated the game 85.75%. Gaming Age gave it a B+. GameSpot's review said that it was "far and away one of the strangest, most original games to come along in years".

The Story of the Kelly Gang

The Story of the Kelly Gang is the world's first feature length movie. This 70 minute movie was made in 1906, nine years before D.W. Griffith's "The Birth of a Nation" made in 1915. The movie tells the story of the famous Australian bushranger, Ned Kelly (1855-1880). It was written and directed by Charles Tait. The movie's reel length is about 4,000 feet (1,200 metres). It was released in Australia on December 26, 1906 and in the UK in January 1908. The movie cost about $2,250 to make. It was filmed in Melbourne and nearby suburbs of St Kilda (indoor scenes), Eltham, Greensborough, Heidelberg, Mitcham and Rosanna. The train scene is filmed near the St. James Road crossing, near Rosanna Station, on the Hurstbridge line in Victoria. The lost scene inside the hotel has a small boy played by Frederick Crew. 

There are only about ten minutes of film left. Many rolls of damaged film were found in an old barn which was once the family home of the Crews in Yarraville, Victoria. The roles were sent to Canberra but they were unable to recover most of the footage. In November 2006 the National Film and Sound Archive made a new digital copy of the movie. This has 11 minutes of extra film which was discovered in the United Kingdom. The movie now is 17 minutes long. It has the main scene of the Kelly's fight with the police at Glenrowan (called the Kelly's Last Stand). A copy of the program book has also been found. It has stories from newspaper reports of the capture of the gang, and the story of the movie, in 6 'scenes'. This told the audiences what was happening in the movie. The book and the little bit of film that is left can help people imagine what the whole movie may have been like.

In 2007 "The Story of the Kelly Gang" was added to the UNESCO Memory of the World Register for being the world's first full-length feature movie.

The Marriage of Figaro

Le nozze di Figaro (in English: "The Marriage of Figaro") is an opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed in 1786. It was written in Italian. The words (libretto) are by Lorenzo da Ponte, who based the story on a play Pierre Beaumarchais. It was the first of three operas that Mozart wrote together with Lorenzo da Ponte: the others are "Don Giovanni" and "Così fan tutte". They are all comic operas (opera buffa).
Although the play by Beaumarchais was at first not allowed to be performed in Vienna because it made fun of the aristocracy, the opera became one of Mozart's most successful works. The overture is especially famous and is often played as a concert piece. 

The opera was a tremendous success when it was first performed in Vienna. It was also extremely popular when it was produced in Prague later that year. He was invited back the following year and asked to write a new opera for Prague, so he wrote "Don Giovanni".

The whole story takes place in one day in the palace of the Count Almaviva in Seville in Spain. Rosina is the Countess and her husband, the Count, wants to make love with a woman named Susanna, who is about to be married to her true love, Figaro, the Count's servant. The Countess has an page boy, Cherubino, who looks after her. Cherubino, however, is starting to fall in love with the Countess. The Count notices this and he tries to get rid of Cherubino by giving him the job of officer's commission in his own army. Figaro, Susanna, and the Countess plan together to embarrass the Count and show how he has being trying to get the attentions of Susanna. Meanwhile Figaro has an argument with Bartolo and Marcellina, which ends when it is shown that he is their son. At night, all these people find themselves in the palace grounds. There is a lot of humour in which people do not recognize one another, thinking they are someone different. In the end it is shown that the Count has been unfaithful and he has to ask his wife to forgive him.

"Figaro and Susanna's room"

Figaro is measuring the bedroom to see how the new bed will fit in. Susanna is trying on her wedding bonnet in front of the mirror. Figaro is quite pleased with their new room, but Susanna is not so sure. She is worried because it is so near to the Count's rooms and she knows that the Count fancies her. In the old days an important person such as a Count had the right to sleep with a servant girl on her wedding night before her husband could sleep with her. It was a law that was becoming old-fashioned at that time. In the story the Count had stopped that law when he married Rosina, but he now he wants it back again. Figaro is very angry and makes plans against the Count.

Figaro goes off, and Dr. Bartolo arrives with Marcellina, his old housekeeper. Marcellina has hired Bartolo as her adviser, because Figaro had once promised to marry her if he was not able to pay back some money which she had lent to him, and she wants that promise to come true. Bartolo, still annoyed with Figaro for having made it easy for the Count and Rosina to marry (this had happened in Beaumarchais’ play "The Barber of Seville"), promises to help Marcellina. It is a comic scene in which he makes fun of lawyers.

Bartolo leaves, Susanna comes back, and Marcellina and Susanna are rude to one another in an over-polite way. Marcellina leaves angrily when Susanna refers to her age.

Cherubino then arrives. He sings a song in which he says he does not understand his new passionate feelings for women, especially for the Countess. He asks for Susanna's help with the Count. It seems the Count is angry with Cherubino's flirting ways. He had discovered him with the gardener's daughter, Barbarina, and plans to punish him. Cherubino wants Susanna to ask the Countess to try to change her husband’s mind. When the Count appears, Cherubino hides behind a chair, because he does not want to be seen alone with Susanna. The Count uses the opportunity of finding Susanna alone to try to win her love, even offering her money. As Basilio, the music teacher, arrives, the Count hides behind the chair because he does not want to be found in a room alone with Susanna. Cherubino leaves that hiding place just in time, and jumps onto the chair while Susanna scrambles to cover him with a dress. Now the Count is behind the chair and Cherubino is on the chair covered by a dress.

When Basilio starts to talk about how Cherubino is fond of the Countess, the Count angrily leaps from his hiding place and he lifts the dress from the chair to show how he found Cherubino under a table in Barbarina's room – and again he finds Cherubino! The young man is only saved from punishment by the entrance of the poor workers of the Count's estate. Figaro had organized this entrance of the workers. He wants to force the Count to give up his ideas about sleeping with Susanna. The Count says he will promise later. He is still keen on punishing Cherubino. He realizes that Cherubino heard what he was saying to Susanna. This blackmail makes the Count have to forgive Cherubino, but he sends the young man off for army duty.
"The Countess' Bedroom" 

The Countess is sad about her husband's infidelity. She thinks she cannot be attractive any more as she is getting older. Susanna comes to get the Countess ready for the day. She has told her about what the Count has been saying to her. Figaro then arrives and makes a plan to trick the Count. His plan is that Susanna will give him a note which says she wants to meet him that night in the garden; Cherubino will be waiting there, dressed as a woman so that the Count thinks he is Susanna. The Countess will arrive and catch him. Figaro has already asked Basilio to give the Count a letter which says that the Countess also has her own secret meeting with someone.

Susanna lets Cherubino into the room but locks the door because she is worried about what the Count will do if he find Cherubino there. Susanna asks him to sing the song he wrote in honour of the Countess. After the song, they put him in women's clothes. The Countess sees Cherubino's letter about joining the army, and she notices that the Count was obviously in such a hurry that he forgot to seal it with his signet ring (which was necessary to make it an official document). Susanna returns to her room for some clothes in which to dress Cherubino. While the Countess and Cherubino are waiting for Susanna to return, they suddenly hear the Count arriving, so Cherubino hides in the cupboard. The Count wants to be allowed into the room and the Countess unlocks the door. The Count enters, angry at the information in the note that he has received from Figaro (given to him by Basilio), hears a noise from the cupboard, and tries to open it, but it is locked. The Countess pretends it is only Susanna, trying on her wedding dress. He does not see Susanna coming back into the bedroom with the clothes and hiding after she realises what is wrong (She knows that to show herself now would be bad for the Countess). Furious and suspicious, the Count leaves with the Countess to find a way to get the door open. As they leave, he locks all the bedroom doors to stop the person in the cupboard from escaping. Susanna comes out of hiding and frees Cherubino, who escapes by jumping through the window into the garden. Susanna then takes his place in the cupboard. 

The Count and Countess return. The Countess finally admits that Cherubino is hidden in the cupboard. The Count draws his sword, promising to kill Cherubino, but when the door is opened, they are both amazed to find Susanna there. The Countess says that she has told the Count that Cherubino was in the cupboard only to test him. Now, shamed by his jealousy, the Count begs for forgiveness. When the Count asks her to explain about the letter accusing the Countess of infidelity, Susanna and the Countess explain that the letter was written by Figaro, and then delivered through Basilio. Figaro then arrives and tries to start the wedding feast, but the Count stops him and asks who wrote the unsigned note given to him by Basilio. Figaro manages to avoid the question, only to have Antonio, the drunken gardener, arrive, complaining about a man jumping out of the window into his plants, and ruining his flowerpots. Antonio brings a letter which, he says, was dropped by the escaping man, and Figaro says it was he who jumped out the window and pretends that he also hurt his foot. However, the letter is Cherubino's appointment to the army. The Countess and Susanna recognize the letter (they had already seen it) and whisper the information to Figaro, who gets out of this situation by saying Cherubino gave it to him because it still needed the Count's seal. Marcellina, Bartolo and Basilio now appear. Marcellina demands that Figaro should honour his contract to marry her. The Count is enjoying this interruption. The wedding will take place later so that the Count can study the problem. The scene ends in a septet (a song for seven voices) and the Countess, anxious and upset, faints.

"The wedding hall" 

The Count thinks about the situation. Susanna enters and agrees to arrange to meet the Count later that because the Countess herself plans to meet the Count but disguised as Susanna. As Susanna leaves, the Count overhears her telling Figaro that he has already won the case. Realizing that he is being tricked, he is determined to force Figaro to marry Marcellina.

Figaro's trial follows, and the judgment is that Figaro must marry Marcellina. Figaro appeals to the Count, but the Count will not change the decision. When Figaro says that he himself is of noble birth and that he was stolen from his parents when he was a baby, it then turns out that Figaro is the long-lost illegitimate son of Bartolo and Marcellina.. Because a mother cannot marry her son, Figaro is let off. During the celebrations, Susanna enters with a payment to free Figaro from his debt to Marcellina. Seeing Figaro and Marcellina in celebration, Susanna thinks that Figaro is happy about marrying Marcellina. The situation is explained to Susanna, and she joins the celebration. Bartolo is very emotional and agrees to marry Marcellina that evening in a double wedding. 

All leave, and the Countess, alone, sings about the loss of her happiness. Susanna enters and tells her the latest plan to trap the Count. The Countess dictates a love letter for Susanna to give to the Count, which suggests that he meet her that night, "under the pine trees." The Count is told to return the pin which fastens the letter.

A chorus of young country workers, among them Cherubino disguised as a girl, arrives to serenade the Countess. The Count arrives with Antonio, and, discovering the page boy, is furious. Barbarina (a peasant girl, Antonio's daughter), calms him down and reminds him of a promise he made to her: "Barbarina, if you will love me, I will give you anything you want." What she wants, it seems, is to marry Cherubino. Very embarrassed, the Count allows Cherubino to stay. 

The act closes with the double wedding, during the course of which Susanna delivers her letter to the Count. Figaro sees the note with the pin in it, thinks it is from another of the Count's secret meetings, and laughs to himself. As the curtain drops, the two newly married couples rejoice.

Count has sent the pin back to Susanna, giving it to Barbarina. Unfortunately, Barbarina has lost it. Figaro and Marcellina see Barbarina, and Figaro asks her what she is doing. When he hears the pin is Susanna's, he is very jealous, especially as he recognises the pin to be the one that fastened the letter to the Count. Thinking that Susanna is secretly meeting the Count, Figaro complains to his mother, and swears to take revenge on the Count and Susanna. Marcellina tells him to be careful, but Figaro will not listen. Figaro rushes off, and Marcellina decides to tell Susanna of Figaro's intentions.

Figaro tells Bartolo and Basilio to come to help him when he gives the signal. They go off, and Figaro thinks about how women are . Susanna and the Countess arrive, dressed in each other's clothes. Marcellina is with them. She has told Susanna of Figaro's suspicions and plans. After they discuss the plan, Marcellina and the Countess leave, and Susanna deliberately sings a love song to her beloved near to where Figaro is so that he can hear it. Figaro is hiding behind a bush and, thinking the song is for the Count, becomes more and more jealous (this is what Susanna wanted). 

The Countess arrives in Susanna's dress. Unfortunately Cherubino has also arrived, and, thinking the Countess is Susanna, tries to kiss the supposed Susanna, but is stopped by the Count. The Count is running after the supposed Susanna (really the Countess), but he cannot get her. They both run off when they notice Figaro nearby. Then the real Susanna arrives in the Countess' clothes. Figaro starts to tell her of the Count's intentions, but suddenly recognizes his bride. He joins in the joke by being very polite to her as if she were the Countess; Susanna, not knowing that Figaro knows it is she, becomes jealous: she thinks Figaro is going to ask the Countess for his love, and so she slaps him. Figaro then tells them that he has recognized Susanna's voice, and they make peace. 

Figaro pretends to declare his love for the supposed Countess as the Count appears. The furious Count calls for his people and for weapons: his servant is trying to make love to his wife. Bartolo, Basilio and Antonio arrive with torches as, one by one, the Count drags out Cherubino, Barbarina, Marcellina and the "Countess" from behind the pavilion.
He refuses to forgive Figaro and the supposed Countess, the real Countess appears and shows who she is; the Count realizes he has been trapped (the supposed Susanna he was trying to seduce was actually his wife), and he simply kneels and asks for forgiveness The Countess sweetly forgives her husband and all are happy. They celebrate as the curtain falls.

<doc id="118486" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=118486" title="My Neighbor Totoro">
My Neighbor Totoro

, or My Neighbour Totoro on UK DVD box titles, is a 1988 animated movie written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli. It won the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize in 1988. This movie was originally released in the United States in VHS format with the title, My Friend Totoro.

Troma Films, under their 50th St. Films banner, produced a 1993 dub of the movie co-produced by Jerry Beck. It was released on VHS and DVD by Fox Video. Troma's and Fox's rights to this version expired in 2004. The movie was re-released by Disney on March 7, 2006. It features a new dub cast. This DVD release is the first version of the movie in the United States to include both Japanese and English language tracks, as Fox did not have the rights to the Japanese audio track for their version.

Two girls, Satsuki and her younger sister named Mei, move to a house in the country with their father to be closer to their hospitalized mother. Mei discovers one day a giant creature named Totoro who lives in the forest by their house. One day, when the girls are waiting for their dad by the bus stop, they both see Totoro and a cat-bus. Later, Mei decides to run away to try to find her mother at the hospital, and gets lost. Satsuki looks for Totoro, who gives her a ride on the cat-bus and helps her find Mei. As the movie ends, the girls are seen delivering an ear of corn to their mom to help her get well.

One of the most significant things to point out in My Neighbor Totoro is that the mother is absent from the home. According to Takie Sugiyama Lebra, “the [Japanese] mother is characterized as having suffered hardships” (154). This is true in Totoro, as Mei and Satsuki’s mother is hospitalized with an unnamed illness. 
The mother’s absence is significant because “at home, the husband depends upon the wife for domestic care. The husband is helpless in housekeeping tasks, such as doing the laundry, cooking, cleaning, and child rearing” (52). In the absence of her mother, it is then Satsuki’s job to take over household tasks with Nanny’s help. This is illustrated several times throughout the movie.

One such illustration is when Satsuki prepares breakfast and lunch for her father and Mei before she leaves for school. This is a task that would normally fall to the mother. Also, the various cleaning and garden tasks that Satsuki and Mei often had the help of Nanny to complete would have also normally been the main responsibility of the mother to complete.

Mei and Satsuki’s father demonstrates both typical and atypical characteristics of a traditional Japanese father. According to Peter Tasker, “Japanese children are accustomed to never seeing their father on the weekdays, and only for short periods at weekends. A husband’s proper field of endeavor is the company” (101). This is only somewhat accurate in Mei and Satsuki’s relationship with their father. Although their father is often away working at the university or visiting their mother in the hospital, he is by no means an absentee father. He is seen working at a desk while Mei plays outside and spending time with his daughters before their bedtime. Many scholarly critiques of Japanese culture would lead one to believe that this is not the norm.

"My Neighbor Totoro" exhibits several important cultural points through the setting and passive details.

The house into which the Kusakabe family moves is an accurate portrayal of a typical, rural, Japanese home. The sliding doors that the father opens when they first move into the house are common architectural features. These doors are meant to be opened during the day, weather permitting, and closed at night. Another feature to point out about the house itself is the way the foundation is constructed. “Japanese houses do not have cellars but are built with a foundation of shallow concrete, or a single row of cement blocks. On top of this type of foundation is placed a row of heavy timbers” (33). This can be seen clearly when Mei crawls under the house in pursuit of one of the smaller totoros.

As for Totoro, he lives in a tree demarcated by a shimenawa (braided straw rope for shinto). The tree is called shinboku (sacred tree). Shinto is the traditional religion of Japan and some consider many of Hayao Miyazaki’s movies—including Totoro—to have Shintoist themes. and interpret Totoro as a kami spirit of the Shinto religion. But Miyazaki says "this movie [Totoro] has nothing to do with that [Shinto] or any other religion." 

The community in which Satsuki and her family have moved is a typical agricultural town. The rice paddies are visible throughout the movie. Rice cultivation is one of the most important industries in Japan, as rice is a staple of the Japanese diet. The home that Satsuki and Mei live in is more spacious than what would be available in a city. Also, the scene where Nanny, Mei, and Satsuki are washing vegetables shows the near self-sufficiency of these farming communities. 

The bath scene is also demonstrative of archetypal Japanese life. “The bathtub is more like a small swimming pool than a tub” (38). As seen in the movie, several people bathe together at once. It is considered rude to enter the tub without first washing, as shown by Satsuki before she enters the tub with her father and Mei. These bathtubs are heated usually by small, well-tended coal burners under the tub.

Another cultural manifestation is the scene that shows the family sleeping. Often, the living room is converted into a bedroom where the whole family sleeps together on mats called futon. This sleeping arrangement is space-efficient and accommodates for smaller housing in a country where living space is severely limited. Mei is sleeping between Satsuki and her father, which is the usual arrangement—with the youngest in the middle.

In one scene, Satsuki is shown preparing the family's lunch in traditional bento style. A bento is a compartmentalized lunch box usually with only one or two tiers. Food is arranged to be aesthetically pleasing. Bentos are extremely common as lunch boxes for children, adults, and even those who stay at home, as Mei does when Satsuki goes to school.

Other passive cultural references include:


"My Neighbor Totoro" was released by Studio Ghibli as a double feature with Isao Takahata's "Grave of the Fireflies" in August 1988. There are two theories for this: one was that "Totoro" would not be successful. Another theory is that "Grave of the Fireflies" was believed to be too depressing for audiences by itself, and thus needed a lighter animation to accompany it. The late Yoshifumi Kondo provided character designs for both movies.

In 1993, Fox released the first English-language version of "My Neighbor Totoro", produced by John Daly and Derek Gibson (the producers of "The Terminator") with co-producer Jerry Beck. Fox and Troma's rights to the movie expired in 2004. Disney's English language version premiered on October 23, 2005; it then appeared at the 2005 Hollywood Film Festival. The Turner Classic Movies cable television network held the television premiere of Disney's new English dub on January 19, 2006, as part of the network's salute to Hayao Miyazaki. (TCM aired the dub as well as the original Japanese with English subtitles.) The Disney version was released on DVD on March 7, 2006. 

As is the case with Disney's other English dubs of Miyazaki movies, the Disney version of "Totoro" features a star-heavy cast, including Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei, Timothy Daly as Mr. Kusakabe, Pat Carroll as Granny, Lea Salonga as Mrs. Kusakabe, and Frank Welker as Totoro and Catbus. The songs for the new dub retained the same translation as the previous dub, but were sung by Sonya Isaacs.




The movie stars the following voice actors:

The movie has an 8.1 rating on IMDb,and a 94% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes.com. Reviews were very positive.

Down with Love is a 2003 movie that has Ewan McGregor and Renee Zellweger as the main characters. It was based on an older movie called "Pillow Talk" in the 1960s.

Catcher Block (McGregor) is a very proud man. He gets a lot of women and he does not respect them very much. When the author Barbara Novak gets an interview with Block about her newest book, he keeps being busy and never actually interviews with her. Novak has written a feminist novel in which she says that women should take more power and have a bigger voice in things and to eat chocolate to reduce their need to be with men. However, when Novak's book becomes very popular, Block wants to know more about Novak.

Block invents a name for himself and begins to go out with her. She falls for him despite what she wrote in her book. She is about to take things farther with Block when a woman rushes in to tell her that she loved Novak's book. It is then that Novak realizes that she has created a movement and that she needs to be the leader of that movement, so she no longer wants to see Block.

Block tries to reinvent himself as a new person. He writes an expose on himself and wants to have it published, but all the women that used to work at his "No" magazine have all quit to try to get jobs at Novak's new "Now" magazine. Block applies for a job there and tells her that he loves her. After a short conversation, they leave in a helicopter to go to Las Vegas to get married.

The Big Mac is a kind of sandwich sold at the fast food-chain McDonald's. It is made using two beef patties, Mac Sauce, dehydrated onions, shredded lettuce, sliced pickles, and a slice of cheese. Also, the Big Mac Index is measured in how much a Big Mac costs in foreign currencies.

The Big Mac was created by Jim Delligatti, one of Ray Kroc's earliest franchisees, who was the owner of some restaurants in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area. It was designed to compete with a similar Big Boy sandwich. Customer response to the Big Mac was so good that it was begun to be made nationally in 1967. One of its well-known and unique features is a middle slice of bread ("club" layer) used to make sure the contents do not move about and to prevent spills.

Serenade

In music, a serenade (or sometimes serenata) is a song or piece of music which is sung or played in someone’s honour. The word comes from the Latin "serenare" meaning: "to make calm".

In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a serenade was usually a song which is sung by a lover underneath the window of his sweetheart in a country such as Spain. The lover may accompany himself on a guitar. This kind of serenade is often seen in operas, e.g. Mozart’s "Don Giovanni ". There is a verb: to serenade, e.g. “the lover was serenading his sweetheart”.

In the Baroque period a serenade was a type of cantata performed outdoors, in the evening, with singers and instrumentas. Composers who wrote this kind of serenade include Alessandro Stradella and Alessandro Scarlatti.

In the Classical music period the serenade became a piece of music for a small orchestra or a group of several instruments. They are similar to a symphony but lighter in character. They are often the same as a divertimento. Mozart wrote several serenades of this type, e.g. his famous "Eine kleine Nachtmusik". Later composers such as Brahms also wrote orchestral serenades. Other Romantic composers often wrote short instrumental works which they called “serenades”.
Also the word serenade is featured in the arctic monkey's song "reckless serenade".

Divertimento

A divertimento is a piece of music which is lighthearted and easy to listen to. It is often performed on social occasions, e.g. as music to be played while people eat, or as after-dinner music.

The divertimento became popular in the 18th century. They were played by a small group of instruments. Mozart wrote several pieces called "divertimento". They are similar to a serenade. A divertimento often has several movements, e.g. six, seven or more.

There are a few examples from the 20th century of pieces called "divertimento", e.g. works by including works by Ferruccio Busoni, Béla Bartók, and Igor Stravinsky (from his ballet "Le Baiser de la Fée").

Freemasonry

Freemasonry is an organization of people who believe in brotherhood and helping others. Its members are known as "Freemasons" (in full: "Ancient Free and Accepted Masons", or simply "Masons"). Freemasons also help one another in times of hardship. Freemasonry can be found all over the world in various forms. About 6 million people are Freemasons.

The local groups in various countries are known as "lodges". At the State or National level are "Grand Lodges". These are independent of each other. "Regular" Freemasonry is only for men, but there are also co-ed Masonic lodges (and lodges for only Women) that are not recognized as legitimate by the "regular" groups. All of these lodges believe in "brotherly love, relief and truth". They do work for charities such as running schools for orphaned children. There is a Royal Masonic Hospital which is a home for old members and their families.

The word mason means a man who works with stone. He is also called a "stonemason". Freemasonry grew from the groups (guilds) of stonemasons in the Middle Ages. These men were building cathedrals and other big buildings. They were called freemasons because they were free, they were not servants who belonged to a rich lord, like many workers were in those days. They often changed jobs and moved about from one town to another. In this way they were different from other craftsmen who often worked in one place and had guilds in one town. The stonemasons tried to keep their skills secret so that only they knew how to do their job. This is probably why the Freemasons have hand shakes and passwords that they swear to keep secret.

About 1650, Masons' guilds started to let people who were not masons into their guilds. In 1717, the first Grand Lodge (the Grand Lodge of England) was formed. It developed into the governing body of Freemasonry in England. In 1813, it merged with a rival and is now called the United Grand Lodge of England.

Freemasonry is controversial. It has been opposed on two grounds, the first religious, is that the Roman Catholic Church opposes Freemasonry , although Freemasonry itself does not block Catholics from joining and a great deal belong to Masonic lodges in South America. The second is political. In Great Britain the Labor Party has advocated laws restricting Masonry.

Die Entführung aus dem Serail

Die Entführung aus dem Serail (in English: "The Abduction from the Seraglio") is an opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It is an example of a Singspiel: a type of German opera which had spoken dialogue as well as singing, and was often about magical stories. Mozart's opera "The Magic Flute" is also a Singspiel. 

The German libretto is by Christoph Friedrich Bretzner and was changed a bit, without Bretzner’s permission, by Gottlieb Stephanie. The story is about the hero Belmonte, helped by his servant Pedrillo, who tries to rescue his beloved Konstanze from the seraglio (palace) of the Pasha Selim.

The opera was first performed by the "Nationalsingspiel" ("national Singspiel") which was sponsored by the Austrian emperor Joseph II. Mozart arrived in Vienna in 1781 and was looking for an opportunity to get a commission for an opera. He showed one his operas ("Zaide") to the manager of the Nationalsingspiel. He was impressed and asked Mozart to write an opera for the company.

The work is lighthearted and meant to be funny. Some of the characters in the story are Turkish. Turkish stories and music were very popular at that time in Europe, and Mozart writes some Turkish music (or what Europeans thought was Turkish music) in this opera. Some of the arias are very difficult to sing, especially the long "Martern aller Arten" ("Tortures of all kinds") sung by Konstanze, which is like a concerto movement. She is accompanied in this aria by an orchestra and four solo instruments.

The opera was a huge success and earned Mozart a good sum of money. However, he was not paid properly for later performances, so it did not make him rich.

When Joseph II heard it he said to Mozart that there were “too many notes”, to which Mozart replied: “There are just as many notes as there should be”.

The singers perform with a Classical orchestra, to which are added instruments needed for "Turkish" music: bass drum, cymbals, triangle, and piccolo. The main orchestra has pairs of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, trumpets, a set of two timpani, and strings. In the aria, "Sorrow has become my lot", there is also a basset horn.

Konstanze, and her English servant Blondchen have been captured by pirates who sold them to the Turk, Pasha Selim. Belmonte goes to rescue her. Osmin, the Pasha's servant, comes to pluck figs in the garden and takes no notice of Belmonte who tries to get news about his servant, Pedrillo. Osmin is angry. After he leaves, Belmonte meets Pedrillo and they decide to rescue Konstanze. 

Selim appears with Konstanze. He wants her to love her, but she doesn’t. Pedrillo suggests to the Pasha that he should employ Belmonte as builder, but Osmin does not let him come into the palace.

Osmin tries roughly to make love to Blondchen. After a duet Osmin departs. Konstanze greets Blondchen in distress and tells her that Selim wants her love and is threatening to use force. 

When she has gone, Pedrillo comes to Blondchen, who is his sweetheart, and tells her that Belmonte is near and plans are ready for a rescue attempt. Blondchen is very happy. Pedrillo invites Osmin to drink. Osmin gets drunk and Belmonte gets him out of the way so that Belmonte again sees his beloved Konstanze. 

Belmonte and Pedrillo come to the garden with ladders. Belmonte manages to snatch Konstanze away, but when Pedrillo is about to escape with Blondchen, they are caught by Osmin, and Belmonte and Konstanze are also brought back by the guard. Belmonte asks the Pasha not to kill them. He says that his father is a rich Spanish governor who will pay a lot of money so that they are freed. Selim Pasha says to Belmonte that he is the son of his greatest enemy, so he is delighted to have caught him. However, the Pasha then becomes kind and decides to forgive them and set them free. Osmin is not happy about this. He would have loved to see them executed.

The Hours (movie)

The Hours is a 2002 movie. It is based on Michael Cunningham's novel "The Hours". It has Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and Meryl Streep as the main characters. It was picked for nine Academy Awards and won one, Best Actress for Kidman.

The movie is about three women living in different times. The first is Virginia Woolf (Kidman) trying to write the novel "Mrs Dalloway" in the early 1930s. The second is Laura Brown, a housewife in the 1950s who is reading the novel. The third is Clarissa Vaughan, who lives in the 1990s and tends to a poet named Richard. Richard often calls her "Mrs. D" or "Mrs. Dalloway" in reference to the novel. The movie moves from one character to another many times and each character is shown for the same amount of time.

Woolf struggles to write her novel. Her hand shakes and she cannot write well. The movie begins with her suicide where she fills her pockets full of rocks and drowns herself in the river. In flashback, it shows her difficulty writing. Her sister Vanessa Bell comes over. Woolf is very fascinated when her niece Angelica finds a dead bird. Woolf kisses her sister very hard when she leaves. Finally, she tries to go to the train station and tells her husband Leonard that she would rather go back to the city than live in the countryside.

Brown does not like her life very much. She makes a cake with her son for her husband and does it again when the first one does not come out right. Her friend Kitty is going to doctor; something is wrong with her. Finally, she takes her son Richie and leaves him at a babysitter and rents a hotel room. She starts reading the book and then we see what it is through her mind – she suddenly imagines that there is a lot of water coming up, like she is drowning.

Vaughn is hosting a party for Richard to celebrate something. She spends a lot of time preparing food and decorations for the party. In the end, however, Richard kills himself by jumping out of the window.

Linux distribution

Linux distributions are made of the Linux kernel and a collection of applications. The operating system will be made up of the Linux kernel and, usually, a set of libraries and utilities from the GNU project, with graphics that come from the X Window System. Distributions that are made to be small may not contain X, but use small window systems like busybox, uclibc or dietlibc. There are more than three hundred Linux distributions. Most of those are in still in development, being improved and changed constantly.

Before the first Linux distributions, a Linux user needed to be a Unix expert, knowing what libraries and executables that were needed to get the system to boot and run.

Linux distributions started to form after the Linux kernel was starting to be used by people outside the original Linux programmers. They were more interested in creating the operating system than making it user-friendly.

Early distributions included: 


SLS was not well-maintained, so Patrick Volkerding created a distribution based on SLS, which he called "Slackware"; released July 16, 1993. This is the oldest being developed.

People who used computers wanted to use Linux distributions as replacements to Microsoft Windows operating systems on the PC, Mac OS on the Apple Macintosh and proprietary versions of Unix.

Distributions are normally split into packages. Each package has a certain application or service. Examples of packages include a collection of fonts, or a web browser.

The package is usually given as compiled code, with installation and removal of packages done by a package management system]. 
Linux distributions usually contain much more software than Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X.

Well-known Linux distributions include: 


There are tools available to help people make the decision easier.

Kurram or Karam () tribal agency is in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) area of Pakistan. Until the year 2000, when divisions were abolished, Kurram District used to be part of the Peshawar Division of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.

The Kurram River drains the southern flanks of the Safed Koh mountain range, and enters the Indus plains north of Bannu. It crosses the Afghan-Pakistan border about 80 km southwest of Jalalabad, and joins the Indus near Isa Khel after a course of more than 320 km (200 miles). The district has an area of 3,310 km² (1,278 sq. miles); the population according to the 1998 census was 448,310. It lies between the Miranzai Valley and the Afghan border, and is inhabited by the Pashtun Turis, a tribe of Turki and Pathan origin who are supposed to have subjugated the Bangash Pashtun about six hundred years ago. The language of the tribe is Pashto, but unlike majority of the Pashtuns they are Shias.

It is highly irrigated, well peopled, and crowded with small fortified villages, orchards and groves, to which a fine background is afforded by the dark pine forests and alpine snows of the Safed Koh. The beauty and climate of the valley attracted some of the Mogul emperors of Delhi, and the remains exist of a garden planted by Shah Jahan.

The Kurram River crosses the Afghan-Pakistan border about 80 km southwest of Jalalabad and in ancient times offered the most direct route to Kabul and Gardez, but the route crossed the Peiwar Pass 3,439 m (11,283 ft) high, just over 20 km west of Parachinar, which was blocked by snow for several months of the year.

The 1981–82 NHL season was the 65th season of the National Hockey League. Twenty-one teams each played 80 games. The William M. Jennings Trophy made its debut this year as the trophy for the goaltenders from the team with the fewest goals against. The New York Islanders won their third straight Stanley Cup by beating the Vancouver Canucks in four games.

Prior to the start of the season, the divisions of the league were re-aligned to better reflect the locations of the teams. The Patrick Division, which had been in the Clarence Campbell Conference, switched to the Prince of Wales Conference, while the Norris Division went the other way, going from the Wales Conference to the Campbell Conference. This divisional alignment existed until the 1993-94 season, at which point both the divisions and the conferences of the league were renamed to reflect geography.

His father was a sacristan and teacher. His mother died when he was 6, and he left home at 13. He went to Kremsmünster to study in a Benedictine monastery. When his voice changed, he became a member of the orchestra as a violinist.

The abbey performed operas and Singspiele, so he had the opportunity to study the operas of Christoph Willibald Gluck and Antonio Salieri. He composed a number of stage works and a good deal of church music for the abbey.

After 1787 he became a student of Salieri in Vienna. In 1792 he also became the vice-director and composer at the Kärntnertortheater.

He helped Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart by copying out the music for "La clemenza di Tito" and "Die Zauberflöte" in 1791. In the same year Mozart died. He had not finished composing his Requiem. Süssmayr finished composing it and handed the completed work to Constanze, Mozart’s widow.

He composed Singspiele (German operas with spoken dialogue), and became Kapellmeister at the National Theater From this time until 1800, he was very successful and popular on the Viennese music scene. However, he became ill with tuberculosis and had to stop work. He died three years later in 1803.

Pantomime

Pantomime (often called panto) is a kind of theatre entertainment usually performed around Christmas and the New Year in Britain and a few other English-speaking countries. It must not be confused with mime (acting with gestures but no speech).

A "pantomimos" in Ancient Greece used to be an entertainment performed by a solo dancer. In the Middle Ages a form of theatre developed called Commedia dell'arte. This was similar to a pantomime. They told a story which had certain fixed characters: the lovers, the father, the servants etc.

The Pantomime first arrived in England as a short entertainment (entr'acte) between opera pieces. Eventually it became a separate show.

Today the pantomime is traditionally performed at Christmas. It is a show for children, but grownups like it as well. Usually a well-known story is told, e.g. Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, Pinocchio, The Three Little Pigs, Puss in Boots, The Musicians of Bremen, Little Red Riding Hood and Goldilocks and the Three Bears etc. There is a lot of spoken dialogue but there are also songs, and sometimes the audience join in. There are many traditions in pantomime. These are some of the main ones:
