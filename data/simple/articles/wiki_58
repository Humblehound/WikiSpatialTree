Velvet

Velvet is a type of woven tufted fabric in which the cut threads are very evenly distributed, with a short dense pile, giving it a distinctly smooth feel.

Velvet can be made from many different fibres. It is woven on a special loom that weaves two pieces of velvet at the same time. The two pieces are then cut apart and the two lengths of fabric are wound on separate take-up rolls. Velvet is difficult to clean due to its pile, but modern dry cleaning methods perform well.

Velvet is made, ideally, from silk. More recently, synthetic velvets have been developed, mostly polyester, nylon, viscose, acetate, and mixtures of different synthetics, or synthetics and natural fibers (e.g. viscose and silk). A small percentage of lycra is used sometimes to give stretch.

The art of velvet-weaving probably originated in medieval Kashmir around the beginning of the fourteenth century. King Richard II of England directed in his will that his body should be clothed "in velveto" in 1399.

The earliest sources of European artistic velvets were weavers in Lucca, Genoa, Florence and Venice.

Nemertea

Nemertea is a phylum of invertebrate animals also known as "ribbon worms" or "proboscis worms". Most of the 1,400 or so species are marine, with a few living in fresh water and a small number of terrestrial forms. They live in all marine habitats, and throughout the world's oceans. Alternative spellings for the phylum have included "Nemertini" and "Nemertinea". "Rhynchocoela" is a name used primarily in North America but gradually abandoned since the 1980s.

Nemertean worms are long, thin, animals without segments. They have no true head, although the anterior end is often slightly wider than the body. They are distinguished by the presence of an eversible proboscis. This is kept inside the body, but pushed out to catch prey. 

Nemerteans collect food with their proboscis, which is closely associated with the digestive system. At rest, the proboscis is inside a long tube that may take up a considerable portion of the worm's length, lying just above the gut. It is attached to the posterior end of this tube by a muscle that pulls it back inside after feeding. At the anterior end, the tube opens into a small cavity close to the brain, and then to the outside through a pore at the anterior tip of the animal.

Nemerteans range in size from 5mm (0.2 in) to over 30 m (100 ft) long in the case of the European "Lineus longissimus", with most species being 20 cm (8 in) or less. There are reports of specimens up to 50 or 60m long, which would make it the longest animal in the world. The longest animal on record is a female blue whale, 29.9m long.

Speed reading

Speed reading is the name for a number of ways to increase the speed at which a text can be read, so that the important facts of the text can still be understood. There are different ways to improve reading speed, but they are all similar. A trained reader is able to read and understand between 200 and 300 words per minute, for a text that is not very difficult to understand. Better training can improve this speed to over 1000 words per minute. Using a lot of exercise, it is possible to increase reading speed further. The best readers can read between 3000 and 4000 words per minute, and understand about 80% of them. 

In general, only a small part of the letters read are seen clearly. The brain guesses what the rest of the word is, based on a small part of the word. This also applies to groups of words, which are treated the same way. Known groups are handled faster, because the reader knows them, and also has an "image" for them. 

What is very important when reading text is the ability to recognize words and word groups. The reader will then add the known image to the context. A known font can help this. 

What is bad for speed reading is having a bad short term memory. Another factor is a small vocabulary. People who only know few words, need more time to "scan" unknown words, simply because fewer words in the text are known.

Maine Road

Maine Road was a large football stadium in Moss Side, Manchester, England. It was home to Manchester City F.C. from when it was built in 1923 until 2003. It takes its name from the street it was built on which also had a remarkable history. The street was first known as Dog Kennel Lane. It formed part of an ancient route south of Manchester. 

When first opened, the stadium was the largest club ground in England and the second largest in the country after Wembley Stadium. Maine Road's record attendance was set in 1934, when 84,569 people attended an FA Cup tie between Manchester City and Stoke City. It is the record for an English club ground (the 1923 FA Cup Final holds the world record). The following February the stadium recorded the highest Football League attendance. This stood at 79,491 for a game against Arsenal. The record has since been beaten for the League, but it is still Manchester City's largest League crowd. The design of the ground changed several times over its 80 year history. Before it closed, Maine Road was an all-seater stadium, with a capacity of 35,150.

The 2002-03 season was Manchester City's last at Maine Road. The last match was played on 11 May 2003. The following season Manchester City moved to City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester. Maine Road was torn down in 2004.

Plans to build Maine Road were first announced in May 1922. It came after a decision by Manchester City F.C. to leave their Hyde Road ground. Hyde Road did not have room for expansion and had been damaged by fire in 1920. Two sites in Belle Vue, East Manchester were suggested, but neither was considered good enough. To many City fans east Manchester was thought of as City's home. Many were disappointed when a site in south Manchester was chosen. A City director, John Ayrton, resigned from the Board later in the decade and helped to form an alternative MCFC, Manchester Central F.C., playing at Belle Vue. 

A sixteen and a quarter acre former brickworking on Maine Road was purchased for £5,500. Maine Road had first been known as Dog Kennel Lane. It was renamed Maine Road during the 1870s because of pressure from the Temperance Movement. 

Stadium construction began late in 1922. Plans by architect Charles Swain proposed a 120,000 capacity ground based on the design of Hampden Park. These plans were reduced to give a capacity of 80,000. However, this figure was still the second largest in the country, behind Wembley Stadium, leading to a label of "The Wembley of the North". Wembley had opened in London only a few months earlier. This made a source of rivalry between the northern and southern divisions of builders Sir Robert McAlpine, who built both stadia. During construction, the stadium was supposedly cursed by a gypsy when Manchester City officials evicted a gypsy camp from the area. This curse was allegedly removed on 28 December 1998. However, the gypsy curse is likely to be an urban myth, as such stories are endemic to a number of football league grounds. Construction took 300 days. The total cost £100,000. The first layout of the ground was one covered stand with a seating capacity of 10,000. It had uncovered terracing on the other three sides, with gentle curves connecting the corners.

The first match at Maine Road took place on 25 August 1923, and saw 58,159 fans watch the home side beat Sheffield United 2-1.

The first changes to the ground took place in 1931, when the corner between the Main Stand and the Platt Lane end at the south of the ground was rebuilt to incorporate a roof. The highest attendance at an English football game of any type at a club ground was at Maine Road on the March 3, 1934, when Manchester City played Stoke City in front of 84,569 fans in the 6th round of the FA Cup. Changes at the Platt Lane end took place in 1935, extending the terracing and providing a roof for the full stand. This marked the peak capacity of the ground, estimated at around 88,000. Further changes were planned, but were suspended when Manchester City were relegated from Division One in 1938, and abandoned when World War II broke out.

The stadium was shared by Manchester United for a period after the Second World War, since Manchester United's Old Trafford ground had been partially destroyed during the Manchester Blitz. United paid City £5,000 per season, plus a share of gate receipts. The highest attendance for a League game at Maine Road occurred during this period, when 83,260 people watched Manchester United play Arsenal on January 17, 1948. This figure is a national record for a League game. 

Floodlights were installed in 1953, and in 1957, prompted by the hosting of two FA Cup semi-finals in successive years, the side facing the Main Stand (which until that time was generally known as the "Popular Side") was redeveloped and named "The Kippax Stand" after a nearby street. Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s, the Kippax became the part of the ground where the club's most vociferous fans congregated. In 1963, benches were installed at the Platt Lane end, meaning that Maine Road had more seats than any other English club ground of the time. The next major redevelopment came in the 1970s, with the construction of the North Stand, a cantilevered stand which remained in place until the closure of Maine Road. The 1980s saw ambitious plans for improvements: however, these plans were shelved due to financial pressures after the Main Stand roof had been replaced at a cost of £1 million. 
By 1990, some areas of the ground looked antiquated, and the Platt Lane stand was demolished in 1992. Its place was taken by the all-seater "Umbro Stand" that also incorporated executive boxes, and was opened in March 1993. The stand was renamed back to the "Platt Lane Stand" in the late 1990s. 

The era of standing accommodation at Maine Road came to an end in May 1994 as the stadium became all-seater to comply with the requirements of the Taylor Report with the demolition of the "Kippax Street Terrace". The final match where standing was permitted took place on 30 April 1994, Chelsea the visitors for a 2–2 draw. Immediately prior to demolition the capacity of the Kippax terrace was 18,300. A three-tier stand was built in its place, holding nearly 14,000 spectators, and on its completion in October 1995 it was the tallest stand in the country. 

The new stand was an impressive modern facility, but it also emphasised the haphazard nature in which the ground had been redeveloped, as all four sides were of differing heights and construction styles. There were further plans for expansion which would have taken the stadium's capacity to 45,000, but these were put on hold following City's relegation from the Premier League in 1996.

There were plans for further expansion at Maine Road to take the capacity to 45,000 all-seated, but these were abandoned in favour of a move to the City of Manchester Stadium that was being constructed for the Commonwealth Games in 2002.

The final competitive match before the closure of the stadium took place on 11 May 2003. Manchester City ended the Maine Road era with a 1-0 defeat to Southampton, with Michael Svensson scoring the stadium's last goal. The final match was followed by short performances by musical acts Badly Drawn Boy and Doves. 

City's final goal at the stadium was scored on 26 April 2003 by Marc-Vivien Foe, who died on 26 June that year from an undetected heart condition while representing the Cameroon national football team.
Toward the end of Maine Road's lifespan there were proposals for other sports teams to make use of the stadium following City's relocation; Stockport County once expressed interest in moving there from Edgeley Park, and in December 2000 Sale Sharks rugby union club was offered a lease for the stadium. However, none of the proposals came to fruition.

An auction of the ground's fixtures and fittings took place in July 2003, raising £100,000, which was donated to community projects in the Moss Side area, which was undergoing a lengthy regeneration process. Demolition began in late 2003, taking seven months. Two years later the go-ahead was given for a new housing development to take part on the site, consisting of 474 homes.

For long periods of its history Maine Road had the widest pitch in England. However, the width was changed several times by managers wishing to alter the pitch size to suit their style of play. In the final season before the ground was closed, the pitch size was 107 x 71 metres (116.5 x 78 yards).

Maine Road hosted two England internationals, the first was a 3-0 defeat of Wales on November 13, 1946 and the second a 9-2 win over Northern Ireland on November 16, 1949, England's first ever World Cup qualifier. In addition, A number of wartime internationals were held at the ground. Maine Road was also the venue for a number of rugby league matches, hosting the rugby league championship final eleven times between 1938 and 1956.

The stadium was used for several scenes in the 1948 motion picture "Cup-tie Honeymoon". More recently, it was featured in the 2000 film "There's Only One Jimmy Grimble" and the 2003 ITV drama "The Second Coming", which starred Christopher Eccleston.

Maine Road has also played host to a number of rock concerts, including The Rolling Stones, Simple Minds, Queen, Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd, Bryan Adams, Jean Michel Jarre, Dire Straits, David Bowie & Guns N' Roses.

In 1974, teen idol David Cassidy played the stadium.

The most high profile concert held at Maine Road was that of Mancunian band Oasis (themselves avowed Manchester City fans) in April 1996, a performance which was later released as a video, "Oasis:...There and Then". 

Prince also played the stadium twice in the early 1990's.

Maine Road also gives its name to a non-league football club, Maine Road F.C.. The club, who currently play in the North West Counties Football League Division One, was founded by a group of Manchester City supporters in 1955. The club previously based its headquarters at the social club adjoining Maine Road.

2008 UEFA Cup Final

The 2008 UEFA Cup Final was the 37th final of the UEFA Cup. It is UEFA's second tier club football tournament. The match was played at the City of Manchester Stadium. It is the home stadium of Manchester City F.C., in Manchester, England, at 20:45 CEST (19:45 local time) on 14 May 2008.

The match was played by Zenit St. Petersburg of Russia and Rangers of Scotland. It was called a battle of Rangers coaching staff, with ex-boss Dick Advocaat, currently the manager of Zenit against current boss Walter Smith. Smith has had two times as manager of Rangers. Both coaches led the Rangers to the Scottish domestic treble; Smith in 1993 and Advocaat in 1999.

Zenit won the match 2–0. They had goals from Igor Denisov and Konstantin Zyryanov. It was their first UEFA Cup title. It made them only the second Russian side to win the competition, after CSKA Moscow in 2004–05.

The logo of the final shows a picture of the City of Manchester Stadium, created by English artist Liam Spencer. It was first shown at a ceremony in the stadium on December 6.

Zenit and Michel Platini asked the British government to ease visa procedures for Russian fans, despite Russia having cancelled visas for British fans travelling to 2008 UEFA Champions League Final in Moscow. However, the Director for British Visa Services for the CIS, Mandy Ivemy, said that "for the U.K. government, visas and biometric checks are a vital part of immigration policy, and we are not prepared to waive them".

Meanwhile, there was a mass flow of Rangers fans into Manchester. Over a hundred thousand supporters 'invaded' the city despite the club's official ticket allocation being just 13,000 and police requests for fans to stay at home. The influx of people resulted in there being no vacant hotel rooms in a twenty mile radius of the city and the total amount of money that was ploughed into the local economy was estimated to be around £25 million.

Rangers' home ground, Ibrox, was opened to show a live beamback of the match to approximately 30,000 spectators. Fans queued overnight for a seat in the stadium. The capacity was reached more than two hours before kick-off.

Zenit St. Petersburg were without the competition's top scorer, Pavel Pogrebnyak, who had picked up two bookings in the knockout stages of the tournament and was therefore suspended. However, they were able to call upon their other star names such as attacking midfielders Andrei Arshavin and Konstantin Zyryanov, as well as holding midfielder Anatoliy Tymoschuk.

Rangers manager Walter Smith started with Jean-Claude Darcheville on his own up-front, with a five man midfield supporting him comprising Steven Davis, Kevin Thomson, Steven Whittaker, Barry Ferguson and Brahim Hemdani. Neil Alexander was making only his tenth start in goal for Rangers, first choice keeper Allan McGregor was injured.


The event was marred by fans rioting in Manchester city centre; these riots started after a big screen that was due to show the match had failed. BBC News 24 interrupted normal programming to broadcast the riots live on television and ITN's flagship News at Ten programme gave extensive coverage to the riots.

A Zenit fan was also attacked and stabbed. Six Rangers fans were arrested on suspicion of grevious bodily harm, but all were released without charges being brought.

UEFA stadium categories

UEFA stadium categories are categories for football stadiums laid out in the UEFA Stadium Infrastructure Regulations. Using these regulations, stadiums are rated as category one, two, three, or elite (in order going up). These categories replaced the old method of ranking stadiums as four or five star in 2006. A stadium must be categorised as elite to host the final of the UEFA Champions League or the UEFA Europa League. These are UEFA's two top club competitions. 

Some of the main criteria which must be met are:





As well, the UEFA delegate after consultation with the main assigned referee will call for the retractable roof if the weather will cause any obstacles for the upcoming game to take place.

Although the minimum stadium capacity for elite categorisation is 30,000, no stadium with a capacity less than 40,000 has been selected to host a UEFA Europa League Final. No stadium with a capacity less than 60,000 has been selected to host a UEFA Champions League Final since these regulations were introduced in 2006.

After the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final, UEFA President Michel Platini stated that he wanted European Cup finals to be held at stadiums with an average capacity of 70,000 to solve security issues. Both the Santiago Bernabéu and Wembley Stadium, hosts for the 2010 and 2011 Champions League finals, respectively, have capacities greater than 70,000, as does the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Italy, which hosted the 2009 Champions League Final. Wembley Stadium, the venue of the 2011 Champions League Final, holds 90,000 spectators. The Allianz Arena, the host venue of the 2012 Champions League Final only holds 66,000 spectators.

Incel

Involuntary celibacy or (incel) is the word for someone who hasn't had sexual intercourse, but wants to, unlike religious clergy. An "involuntary celibate" is someone who suffers from involuntary celibacy. The phrase means involuntary, as in doesn't want to, and celibacy, which is not being in a relationship. People who are incel often try to attract a mate and improve, but don't get the opportunities to. An incel is someone who is without a relationship for a long period of time, while someone who is single for a few months is not an incel.

Some problems caused by incel are depression, frustration, and loneliness. In society today, it is usually expected for people to have had sexual encounters. Peer pressure can make this worse, and can make the incels more likely to kill themselves. The longer a person is incel, the worse the problems become, and incels have a higher death rate than normal people.

Incel can be caused by not enough social skills, charisma, disabilities, and other things like homelessness. One large cause is shyness. This is because men are usually supposed to ask a girl out, so shy men won't get as much experience. Other causes are more physical, like looks, as an beautiful person is more likely to date than an ugly person.

The Futureheads

The Futureheads are a four-piece English, punk band from Sunderland. Their name comes from the title of the The Flaming Lips album, "Hit to Death in the Future Head".

The band met at City of Sunderland College as a quartet consisting of Barry Hyde (vocals and guitar), David "Jaff" Craig (bass), Peter Brewis (drums), and Ross Millard (vocals and guitar). Millard and Craig had been in another local band together before. They used the Sunderland City Detached Youth Project building (where Brewis and Hyde worked) as a free practice space. The project was meant to get young people off the streets by using music. They first performed in 2000. The reputation in the area grew through word-of-mouth. Hyde's younger brother Dave replaced Brewis (who went on to form Field Music).

In an interview with Channel 4's "4Music", Barry Hyde said that Dave Hyde was given a golden guitar by his parents when he was young. But Barry had taken it off him to learn to strum his first chords. Dave was left with nothing, forcing him to take up the drums.

The Futureheads played their first gig at Ashbrooke Cricket and Rugby Club in December, 2000. They debuted with their "Nul Book Standard" EP and then their "123 Nul EP" on March 10, 2003. Later that year they released their first single, "First Day," on August 4.

The Futureheads released their self-titled debut album in September, 2004 on 679 recordings. Five tracks of the tracks were produced by Andy Gill of Gang of Four. The rest of the album was produced by Paul Epworth. The song "Decent Days And Nights" from the album was featured in the video game soundtrack to "" on PlayStation 2 and Xbox as well as EA's "Rugby 2005".

On February 21, 2005, "Hounds of Love", a cover of a Kate Bush song, was released as a single. It reached number eight in the UK Singles Chart in its first week. It was named Best Single of 2005 by "NME". The band toured the United States. They later supported the Pixies, Foo Fighters and Snow Patrol.

They performed at BBC Radio One's One Big Weekend, held in their home town of Sunderland over the weekend of May 7-8, 2005. On May 8, 2005 Sunderland A.F.C. picked up the Coca-Cola Championship trophy. In tribute, the Futureheads performed a set live at the Stadium of Light as pre-match entertainment.

The stand-alone EP, "Area" was released in November, 2005 while the band was working on their second album "News and Tributes". According to "NME" in February, 2006, it took only five weeks to make. The first single from the album was "Skip to the End" released on May 15. The album "News and Tributes" was first released on May 29, 2006.

The band became bothered by major label music business and being under contract were very lucky to be set free by 679 Recordings. Hyde said "we were desperate to get out of the record deal, they could easily have kept us and made us try and make more records but we didn't want that'

Throughout the rest of 2006, The Futureheads started their own independent record label, Nul Records, and started working on songs for their next album.

In June, 2007, they reportedly completed work on their third album, "This Is Not the World," which was released in May, 2008. Millard said that he expected the new album to be punkier than the last album. He also said that the band was close to splitting during the time after the second album was released. 

The band made a free download called "Broke Up The Time" available from their website on November 9, 2007. They also announced three gigs in the UK followed by a full UK tour. They now have their own label, Nul Records, set up exclusively to distribute Futureheads material. In December, 2007 the band released a video of them walking around Carnaby Street, London to the single "The Beginning of the Twist." It was also accompanied by a free download of a song called "Crash."

The second single from their album "Radio Heart" was released on May 19, 2008 from their album "This Is Not The World" followed by the release of the music video for the single on April 16. A third single from the album, "Walking Backwards," was released on August 4, 2008.

Their latest single, "I Wouldn't Be Like This If You Were Here," was released on December 8, 2008. In 2009 the band played at the biggest open-air festival in Europe (400,000 - 500,000 rock fans every year) - Przystanek Woodstock in Poland. In November, 2009, the band allowed fans to download a new free track, "Struck Dumb," for a period of two weeks. The band released their new album, entitled The Chaos, on 26th April 2010 in the UK. The overall sound is a little darker and punkier than that of its predecessor. The Chaos will be released in the USA on 1 June 2010, on Dovecote Records.

The band is influenced by New Wave and Post-punk bands such as Devo, XTC, Wire, and the Post-hardcore Fugazi. They are also strongly influenced by 1990's singer Lou Bega.

2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations

The second Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament (known as the Gillette Tri-Nations due to sponsorship) was played between 16 October and 27 November of 2004. The format of the competition was different from the previous event. In that event the teams played each other twice instead of once before the final.

The tournament final of the tournament was predicted by some to be a close affair. The British team was considered a small favourite after finishing at the top of the league table. Instead, it was a one-sided match as Australia produced their best performance of the tournament. The game was basically over by half-time when Australia led by 38-0.

During the series, Australia and New Zealand played additional Tests against France.
A one off match was also played between an ANZAC side made up of touring Australian and New Zealand players and a Cumbira side.

Gneiss

Gneiss is a type of metamorphic rock. The minerals in gneiss may come from rocks which were originally either igneous or sedimentary. They were heated and squeezed, and the minerals recrystallized.

In gneisses, minerals tend to be foliated: layered and segregated into bands. Thus there are seams of quartz and of mica in a mica schist, very thin, but consisting essentially of one mineral.

The Lewisian complex or Lewisian Gneiss is a suite of Precambrian metamorphic rocks that outcrop in the northwestern part of Scotland, forming part of the Hebridean Terrane. These rocks are of Archaean and Paleoproterozoic age, ranging from 3.0–1.7 Ga.

Román Fresnedo Siri

Roman Fresnedo Siri (Salto (Uruguay) February 4 . 1903 - Montevideo, June 26 . (1975), Uruguayan architect.

An international competition to choose the most original design had been won in 1961 by a uruguayan architect, Mr. Roman Fresnedo Siri. Siri had won acclaim for designing major civic buildings hroughout South America, including offices and hospitals. He also had a passion for the ocean, and even used his talents to design racing yachts. 

Siri’s spirit and originality did not disappoint. From its earliest days, architects and passersby alike were intrigued by surprises in the buildings' construction. Rising dramatically from the shore of the historic Potomac River, two distinct structures dominated the triangular block of land: a circular council chamber and an 11-story crescent-shaped secretariat. By December 1964, texture and pattern had begun to emerge, giving each building a distinct character. Geometric diamond shapes decorated the outside of the council chamber, visually played off against the elegant vertical lines of the larger secretariat building. Gradually, other elements were added: reflecting pools, white columns, and slim concrete fins that gave the buildings a soaring quality. 

Just over two years after work began, the completed secretariat was ready to house hundreds of staff members in approximately 170,000 square feet of space, furnished with marble, paintings, sculptures, and other gifts from PAHO member nations. 
The council chamber alone could accommodate 400 delegates within its circular walls. The new PAHO headquarters was officially opened on September 27, 1965.

Photomask

In electronics, a photomask is a special stencil which is used to create a printed circuit board. When light is shone through the photomask, certain parts where the light hits the unused circuit board are strengthened, much like what toothpaste does to the hard surfaces your teeth. When a circuit board is put through an acid bath, the parts where the light shone through the photomask stay in place, while the parts that were covered by the shadow of the photomask are eaten away by the acid.

Gastrotricha

The Gastrotricha, often called "hairy backs", are a phylum of microscopic (0.06-3.0 mm) animals abundant in fresh water and marine environments. Marine species are found mostly in between sediment particles, while terrestrial species live in the water films round grains of soil. About 700 species have been described.

Gastrotrichs are bilaterally symmetric, with a transparent body and a flat underside. Many species have a pair of short projections at the rear end. The body is covered with cilia, especially about the mouth and on the lower surface. Its two end projections have cement glands. This is a double-gland system where one gland secretes the glue and another secretes a de-adhesive. Like many microscopic animals, their movement is mainly powered by hydrostatics.

Gastrotrichs develop to a particular number of cells; further growth comes only from an increase in cell size. As is typical for such small animals, there are no respiratory or circulatory organs. Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall, as part of respiration. The nervous system is relatively simple. The brain consists of two ganglia, one on either side of the pharynx. Each ganglion gives rise to a single nerve cord, which runs the length of the body and includes further, smaller ganglia. The main sense organs are the bristles and ciliated tufts of the body surface. Some gastrotrichs also possess light sensitive cells in the brain that work as primitive ocelli (eye spots).

Gastrotrichs are simultaneous hermaphrodites: they have both male and female sex organs. Once the sperm are produced, they are picked up by an organ on the tail that functions as a penis, and transferred to the partner. Fertilisation is internal, and the eggs are released by rupture of the body wall.

Many species reproduce entirely by parthenogenesis. In these species the male portions of the reproductive system are non-functional or entirely absent. 

Some species can lay eggs that can remain dormant during times of dessication (drought) or cold. These species produce regular eggs during good environmental conditions, which hatch in one to four days. The eggs hatch into miniature versions of the adult. The young typically reach sexual maturity in about three days, and gastrotrichs can live up to ten days under laboratory conditions.

Hand axe

A hand axe is a stone tool of the Lower (early) and Middle Paleolithic Stone Age. It was a bifacial, similar on both sides, and held in the hand, not with a handle like a modern axe. It was held directly in the hand, perhaps wrapped in a piece of leather. 

This kind of axe is typical of the Acheulean and the Mousterian cultures, and is the longest-used tool of human history. Hand axes were certainly used for at least a million and a half years. They were made by earlier species of man, such as "Homo erectus" and "Homo neanderthalensis" (Neanderthal Man); it was one of their most important tools. The hand axe cultures were preceded by an even older Oldowan culture of primitive stone tools (2.6 to 1.7 million years ago) in Africa. 

Lighter weight hand axes were also made by our own species, "Homo sapiens", but we moved on to create a much wider range of tools.

Hand axes are found mainly in Africa, Europe and Northern Asia, while South Asia retained flake-industries such as the Hoabinhian.

New archaeological evidence from Baise, China shows that there were also hand axes in eastern Asia.

Older hand axes were produced by direct percussion with a stone hammer and can be distinguished by their thickness and a sinuous border. Later Mousterian handaxes were produced with a soft billet of antler or wood and are much thinner, more symmetrical and have a straight border.

An experienced flintknapper needs less than 15 minutes to produce a good quality hand axe. A simple hand axe can be made from a beach pebble in less than 3 minutes.

Hand axes are mainly made of flint, but rhyolites, phonolites, quartzites and other rather coarse rocks were used as well. Obsidian was rarely used, because is is not widely found. It produces a brilliant blade, but shatters more easily than flint.

Several basic shapes, like cordate, oval, or triangular have been distinguished, but their significance is not agreed upon.

Hand axes were no doubt a multi-purpose tool. Research on their cutting edges has shown that, in many cases, they were used for butchering meat. This would include extracting bone marrow (which would explain the pointed end) and general hacking through bone, muscle and tendons. Experiments at Boxgrove would appear to back this up. We know for sure that Neanderthals, at least, were hunters of large mammals such as mammoths, and that may be true of other hand axe cultures. The need for such a heavy tool is thus easily understood. Wielding a hand axe requires considerable strangth, but Neanderthals were stronger than us in their upper bodies.

Studies in the 1990s at Boxgrove, in which a butcher attempted to cut up a carcass with a hand axe, showed that the hand axe was perfect for getting at the bone marrow, which is high in protein and vitamins and thus was highly prized as a food source.

The original Piccadilly Radio continued to broadcast on the AM frequency of 1152 kHz. 

The station broadcasts on the analogue frequency 103FM, from a 4 kW transmitter on Saddleworth Moor. It broadcasts on DAB Digital Radio from City Tower (formerly Sunley Tower) on the CE Manchester multiplex.

C2 Green Tea

C2 Green Tea is a bottled green tea beverage produced and manufactured by Universal Robina. The drink was first manufactured in the Philippines. Sometimes it is simply called as C2
The term C2 is actually an abbreviation. It stands for "Cool & Clean".

C2 Green Tea is brewed and bottled in the same day which is safe. The drink contains natural green tea leaves ("Camellia sinensis"). The leaves were brewed gently to retain the antioxidants normally lost in other extraction processes. In fact the chinese characters in the bottle means The “brewed from natural green tea leaves.” It is bottled in PET bottles.

Currently C2 is available worldwide, at 32 countries and territories

As of 2009, twelve variants can be bought in the Philippines. C2 Green Tea is available in 230ml, 355ml, 500ml, 1000ml, and 1500ml bottles.


On the 50th anniversary of the Universal Robina Corporation on August 2006, the company released limited edition gold bottles of 500 ml of the C2 Green Tea Plain variant.

On January 2007, C2 was introduced to Vietnam with two variants only available in Vietnamese markets. The bottle design of these exclusive variants is slightly different than the original design. 


Text messages circulated that the use of PET bottles, which was use in manufacturing C2, is dangerous to the health.
Later, the company issued a statement that the use of PET bottles for cold and hot-fill food and beverages has been approved by both the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority. The company also said that adheres to the conditions of use for PET bottles, as set forth by the organizations mentioned earlier.

Untouched materials were only use in producing C2's bottles. It is perfectly safe for a consumer to re-use a C2 (PET) bottle as long as it has not been used earlier to store harmful chemicals, and full sanitation is applied prior to the next usage occasion.

Joey Scarbury

Joey Scarbury (born June 7, 1955) is an adult contemporary singer best known for his hit song, "Theme from "The Greatest American Hero" (Believe It or Not)", in 1981.

Growing up in Thousand Oaks, California, Scarbury was continually encouraged in his ambition to sing by his mother. At the age of 14, after being spotted by songwriter Jimmy Webb's father, he was signed to a recording contract, and seemed to be destined for stardom. Scarbury's first single, "She Never Smiles Anymore," flopped, and he was soon without a record label. 

Scarbury, undaunted by what happened, stayed in music up through the 1970s singing backup for artists like Loretta Lynn, and occasionally recording his own material. Although he had a minor chart single with "Mixed Up Guy" in 1971, real chart success eluded him for the rest of the decade. This was to change when he started working for record producer and composer Mike Post. Post was hired along with Stephen Geyer to write the theme tune for a new TV series dubbed "The Greatest American Hero", about a high school teacher who comes into possession of a superhero outfit, and Scarbury was chosen to record it. An extended version of the song (3:15 compared to the television theme's minute-long length), released by Elektra Records, shot up to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100. 

Scarbury could not follow it up however, and after charting at #49 with the single "When She Dances", Scarbury disappeared again from the charts. Scarbury went on to work with Post again in the mid 1980s to record the song "Back to Back", for the television series "Hardcastle and McCormick" and teamed up with Desiree Goyette to record "Flashbeagle" for the Peanuts special "It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown". He also performed the opening theme for the television series "Jennifer Slept Here".

In 1990, Scarbury found success again as a songwriter. This time, his co-written song "No Matter How High" was recorded by The Oak Ridge Boys and was a number one country music hit. His co-writer on this song was Even Stevens who previously had found success with co-writing songs for country star Eddie Rabbitt, as well as the Kenny Rogers hit "Love Will Turn You Around" from the motion picture "Six Pack".

His hit song from "The Greatest American Hero" appeared in Michael Moore's film "Fahrenheit 9/11" on the scene when President George W. Bush declares the Iraq Mission Accomplished.

As of 10/17/08, Joey is back on the radio after a long absence. His current single "How Do You Sleep At Night" released on Golden Records has broken the top 40 and is currently #48 on the Music Row secondary radio chart.

Scarbury has released several singles starting in 1969 on Dunhill, followed by releases on Reena, Playboy, Bell, Columbia, RCA, Big Tree, Lionel, and Elektra labels.<br>

Kenny Rankin

Kenny Rankin (Los Angeles, February 10, 1940 - June 7, 2009) was an American pop and jazz singer and songwriter originally from the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City, New York.

Rankin was raised in New York and was introduced to music by his mother, who sang at home and for friends. Early in his career he worked as a singer-songwriter, and developed a considerable following during the 70s with a steady flow of albums, three of which broke into the Top 100 of the Billboard Album Chart. His liking for jazz was evident from an early age, but the times were such that in order to survive his career had to take a more pop-oriented course. By the 90s, however, he was able to angle his repertoire to accommodate his own musical preferences and to please a new audience while still keeping faith with the faithful. Rankin's warm singing style and his soft, nylon-stringed guitar sound might suggest an artist more attuned to the supper-club circuit than the jazz arena, but his work contains many touches that appeal to the jazz audience.

Rankin appeared on "The Tonight Show" more than twenty times. Host Johnny Carson was so impressed by him that he wrote the liner notes to Rankin's 1967 debut album "Mind Dusters," which featured the single "Peaceful." Kenny's friend Helen Reddy would reach #2 Adult Contemporary and #12 Pop in 1973 with a cover of it, released as her follow-up single to "I Am Woman". Georgie Fame also had a hit with this song in 1969, his only songwriting credit to hit the British charts reaching number sixteen and spending 9 weeks on the chart.

Rankin's accompanists from time to time included Alan Broadbent, Mike Wofford and Bill Watrous, and on such occasions the mood slips easily into a jazz groove. His compositions have been performed by artists such as Mel Tormé and Carmen McRae, while Stan Getz said of him that he was "a horn with a heartbeat". Rankin was deeply interested in Brazilian music and his "Here In My Heart," on which he used jazz guests including Michael Brecker and Ernie Watts, was recorded mostly in Rio De Janeiro. More contemporary songs were given an airing following his move to Verve Records, including the Beatles' "I've Just Seen A Face" and Leon Russell's "A Song For You."

Rankin's own unique gift for reworking classic songs such as The Beatles' "Blackbird," which he recorded for his "Silver Morning" album, so impressed Paul McCartney that he asked Rankin to perform his interpretation of the song when McCartney and John Lennon were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Rankin was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in early 2009. He died in Los Angeles, California - where he had resided for many years - from the disease on June 7, 2009. He was 69 years old.

Jonathan Edwards (athlete)

Jonathan David Edwards, CBE, (born 10 May 1966 in London) is a former British triple jumper. He is a former Olympic, Commonwealth, European and World champion. He has held the world record in the event since 1995.

After his retirement as an athlete, Edwards has worked as an athletics commentator and presenter for BBC television. He was a devout Christian. He presented episodes of the BBC Christian worship programme "Songs of Praise". But he lost faith in 2007. He is a member of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games.

Edwards attended West Buckland School where his ability in the triple jump was seen at an early age. He was a strong all-rounder and on leaving received the school's top award for sporting and academic excellence, the Fortescue Medal. Other students with Edwards at West Buckland School included Victor Ubogu and Steve Ojomoh. Both are former Bath and England Rugby international players. Edwards now has a Sports Hall at West Buckland named after him; "The Jonathan Edwards Sports Centre". Edwards then read Physics at Durham University, attending Van Mildert College.

Because of his strong Christian beliefs, he refused to compete on Sundays at first. Eventually he decided to do so in 1993. This decision proved important, since the qualifying round at that year's World Championships took place on a Sunday. He went on to win the bronze medal.

In his breakthrough year of 1995, he produced a jump of 18.43 m (60 feet 5½ inches) at the European Cup. The leap was wind assisted and did not count for record purposes. But it was a sign of things to come as he capped an unbeaten year. He had a historic gold medal performance at the World Championships. There he broke the world record twice in the same meet. On his first jump, he became the first man to legally pass the 18-metre barrier (18.16 m/59 feet 7 inches). That record lasted for about 20 minutes. His second jump of 18.29 m made him the first to jump 60 feet. During his commentary for the 2008 Summer Olympics, Edwards said that during the 1995 World Championships, he felt as if "he could jump as far as he needed to". Later the same year Edwards became the BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

During 1996 Edwards went into the Olympic games as favourite and world record holder. But it was American Kenny Harrison who took the gold with a jump of 18.09 m. Edwards walked away with the silver after a leap of 17.88 m (the longest ever jump not to win gold). Edwards won the gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games. He was awarded the CBE shortly afterwards. He also won golds at the 2001 World Championships and 2002 Commonwealth Games. At one point in 2002, Edwards held all the gold medals for the "four majors" (Olympic Games, World Championships, Commonwealth Games & European Championships). He retired after the 2003 World Championships as Great Britain's most successful medal winning athlete.

Following his retirement, Edwards pursued a media career as a television presenter. He worked mainly for the BBC as a sports commentator and on programmes such as "Songs of Praise". He gave up this programme, due to his loss of faith, in February 2007.

In 2004 Edwards joined with Paula Radcliffe on an "Olympic Special Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?". The pair raised £64,000 for charity with half of that sum going to the British Olympic Association and a quarter of the sum going to Asthma UK.

He is a member of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. He represents athletes in the organisation of the 2012 Summer Olympics.


An honorary doctorate was conferred upon him at a ceremony at the University of Exeter on 21 January 2006.

Later in the same year, an honorary doctorate of the university (DUniv) was conferred upon him at the winter graduation ceremony of the University of Ulster (19 December 2006).

Edwards lives with his wife Alison in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne. He has two sons, Nathan and Sam.

He initially refused to compete on Sundays due to his devout Christian beliefs. This decision cost him a chance to compete in the 1991 World Championships. However in 1993, after much thinking and discussion with his father (a vicar), he changed his mind. He decided that God gave him his talent in order for him to compete in athletics. 

On 2 February 2007 it was widely reported that Edwards had lost his faith in God despite him once saying "My relationship with Jesus and God is fundamental to everything I do. I have made a commitment and dedication in that relationship to serve God in every area of my life."

The "Daily Mail" described Edwards as a "man deeply troubled by the collapse of his Christian faith". It also revealed that a friend said "[Edwards] has a deep, theological comprehension of the Bible, making his spiritual meltdown even more unlikely ... They still go to church as a family" The "Daily Mail" article also quoted Edwards as saying that he is going through a difficult period in his life. A period that is deeply personal to him and his family such that he does not wish to comment on.

Edwards presented episodes of the Christian praise show Songs of Praise until 2007.

In an interview in "The Times" on 27 June 2007, Edwards said: "If there is no God, does that mean that life has no purpose? Does it mean that personal existence ends at death? They are thoughts that do my head in. One thing that I can say, however, is that even if I am unable to discover some fundamental purpose to life, this will not give me a reason to return to Christianity. Just because something is unpalatable does not mean that it is not true." Furthermore, in the interview with "The Times" he also stated "When you think about it rationally, it does seem incredibly improbable that there is a God." In the same interview he also said "I feel internally happier than at any time of my life." Edwards confirmed his rejection of Christianity in an interview on BBC Five Live Sportsweek on 29 July 2007.

Explosion protection

Explosion protection is meant to protect buildings and other civil engineering objects against internal and external explosions. It was widely believed until recently that a building subject to an explosive attack had a chance to remain standing only if it possessed some extraordinary resistive capacity. This belief rested on the assumption that the blast load was fully beyond our control.

The draw was held on Tuesday, 9 October 2007 at 12:00 CET in Nyon, Switzerland. It was conducted by UEFA's director of professional football Giorgio Marchetti and Michele Centenaro, UEFA's head of club competitions. 

Based on paragraph 6.06 in the UEFA regulations for the current season, if two or more teams were equal on points on completion of all the group matches, the following criteria were used to determine the rankings:

Key:

All of the rounds in the final phase are two-legged, except for the final. In the event of aggregate scores being equal after normal time in the second leg, the winning team will be that which scored more goals on their away leg: if the scores in the two matches were identical, extra time is played. The away goals rule also applies if scores are equal at the end of extra time. If there are no goals scored in extra time, the tie is decided on a penalty shoot out. The team first out of the hat in each tie plays the first leg of their tie at home, and the second leg away.

The draw for the round of 32, which was conducted by UEFA General Secretary David Taylor and Michele Centenaro, UEFA's head of club competitions, was held on Friday, 21 December 2007 at 13:00 CET in Nyon, Switzerland. The eight group winners were drawn against the eight third-placed teams, while the eight second-placed teams were drawn against the eight teams who finished third in the Champions League groups. Teams from the same group or the same country cannot be drawn together.

The first legs were played on 13 February and 14 February 2008. The second legs were played on 21 February 2008.

The draw for the Round of 16, which was conducted by UEFA General Secretary David Taylor, was also held on Friday, 21 December 2007 at 13:00 CET in Nyon, Switzerland. The first legs were played on 6 March 2008. The second legs were played on 12 and 13 March 2008. Unlike the previous rounds, teams from the same group or country may be drawn together from the round of 16 onwards.

The draw for the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final, which was conducted by UEFA General Secretary David Taylor and Denis Law, the ambassador for the final in Manchester, was held on Friday, 14 March 2008 at 14:00 CET in Nyon, Switzerland. The first legs of the quarter-finals were played on 3 April and the second legs were played on 10 April 2008.

The semi-final matches were played on 24 April and 1 May 2008.

The final was contested by Russian side Zenit St. Petersburg and Scottish side Rangers on 14 May 2008 at the City of Manchester Stadium in Manchester, England. Zenit won the match 2–0, with goals from Igor Denisov and Konstantin Zyryanov coming in the last 20 minutes of the game to give Zenit their first UEFA Cup title.

The night was marred by rioting by a minority of Rangers supporters in Manchester city centre.

B of the Bang

B of the Bang was a sculpture in Manchester, England, located next to the City of Manchester Stadium at Sportcity. The work was designed by Thomas Heatherwick. It was taken apart in 2009 due to structural problems.

Commissioned to mark the 2002 Commonwealth Games, it was one of the tallest structures in the City of Manchester. It was the tallest sculpture in the UK until the completion of "Aspire" in 2008. It was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The sculpture took its name from a quotation of British sprinter Linford Christie. In the quotation he said that he started his races not at the "bang" of the starting pistol, but at 'The B of the Bang'.

The sculpture was commissioned in 2003. Construction went longer than planned and the official unveiling was delayed until 12 January 2005. Six days before the launch, the sculpture suffered the first of three visible structural problems. The tip of one of the spikes came off and fell to the ground. Legal action started a year later, resulting in an out-of-court settlement totalling £1.7m.

In February 2009 Manchester City Council announced that the sculpture would be taken apart and placed in storage, as the "only practical alternative". The council said it was committed to working closely with the design team in order to "determine whether there is a robust and affordable strategy for the re-construction of the structure on the site". Despite the promise of storage and potential reassembly, the core and legs of the sculpture were cut apart during removal.

"B of the Bang" originally stood tall. It had 180 hollow tapered steel columns or spikes coming out of a central core. It was angled at 30 degrees and supported by five long, tapered steel legs. These connected to the spikes above the ground. The sculpture weighed 165 tonnes. The concrete in the foundations weighed over 1,000 tonnes, including a reinforced concrete slab. The foundations are deep.

The sculpture was made from the same weathering steel (also known as Cor-Ten) as the Angel of the North sculpture. This slowly develops a tightly adhering oxide layer as it is exposed to the elements. This layer prevents further corrosion by reducing its permeability to water. As part of the design, the spikes moved slightly in the wind in order to withstand gusts over . At the time of construction a time capsule was placed in one of the spikes of the sculpture. It contained children's poems and paintings, due to be opened around 2300. The location of the time capsule after being taken apart is currently unknown.

"B of the Bang" was located next to the City of Manchester Stadium at Sportcity, in Beswick, at the corner of Alan Turing Way and Ashton New Road; coordinates . It took its name from a quotation of British sprinter Linford Christie in which he said that he started his races not merely at the 'bang' of the starting pistol, but at 'The B of the Bang'. The artwork had been nicknamed "KerPlunk" by the locals after the popular children's game from the 1970s.

Prior to the construction of Aspire at the University of Nottingham, "B of the Bang" was Britain's tallest sculpture. It stood at twice the height of the Angel of the North. Angel of the North stands at . It was designed to look like an exploding firework. It was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It was commissioned by New East Manchester Limited to commemorate the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The design was selected by a panel consisting of both local residents and art experts via a competition in 2002. The sculpture was designed by Thomas Heatherwick.

The sculpture was constructed in Sheffield by Thomas Heatherwick Studio, Packman Lucas, Flint and Neill and Westbury Structures. It was approved at the start of 2003, with the central core arriving in Manchester on the 13 June 2004. This was the largest load that could be transferred via road from the factory, and required a police escort. This central core was lifted into place in August 2004, after which the 180 spikes could begin being attached. Early estimates had given an optimistic completion date of July 2003, which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname "G of the Bang".

The official unveiling by Linford Christie took place on 12 January 2005.

In total the sculpture cost £1.42 million to design and construct — twice the original estimate, as the initial costing had neglected to include installation costs. Funding was sourced from a European Regional Development Fund contribution of £700,000, the North West Development Agency, contributing £500,000, and Manchester City Council providing £120,000.

The tip of one of the spikes detached and fell from the sculpture on the 6 January 2005, only six days before the official unveiling. After inspection, the event went ahead as planned.

Four months later, in May 2005, a second spike had to be cut off by firefighters after it was discovered hanging loose. At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public, and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed. As a result some of the joints were re-welded, with equipment put in place to prevent excessive movement. This consisted of retrofitting tip weights to 170 of the spikes.

Despite these modifications, "B of the Bang" remained fenced off, prompting a local newspaper campaign to 'Get It Sorted'. In May 2006 a total of nine spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away for metallurgical analysis, to discover the stresses being placed on the steel.

It was announced in October 2007 that Manchester City Council were taking legal action against the makers of the sculpture, with the aim of completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture. In November 2008 this culminated in an out-of-court settlement being reached between Manchester City Council, the project's designers Thomas Heatherwick Studio Ltd, and the engineering and construction subcontractors Packman Lucas Ltd, Flint and Neill Partnership and Westbury Structures Ltd. The agreement was to pay the council £1.7m in damages for breach of contract and negligence.

Acting on a report in January 2009, the city council recommended that "B of the Bang" should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe reinstatement. The report recognised the sculpture's aesthetic value for Manchester and Manchester City Council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long-term solution. One possibility involved the replacement of the steel spikes with alternatives made from carbon fibre, although the report underlined the necessity for extensive testing. 

In January 2009, Antony Gormley, creator of the Angel of the North — to which "B of the Bang" is often compared — spoke out in support of the sculpture, stating that, ""It is a great tribute to Manchester that this ground-breaking work was commissioned. To allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the council's nerve."" 

Despite Gormley's plea, removal of "B of the Bang" began in April 2009. More substantial hoarding was erected around the site and demolition firm Connell Bros Ltd. began removing the spikes with oxyacetylene cutting equipment. 

Although the council had earlier promised to store the complex central core and legs, these too were cut apart during removal, casting doubt on future prospects for the landmark sculpture's return.

College degree

A college degree is a type of certification, or official credentials, that indicates a person has completed all the college (or university) classes to earn that award. The number of college courses (separate school classes), required to graduate, will vary depending on whichever college is attended.

There are hundreds of different college degrees, but they are often grouped into a few categories:
The college courses needed for a master's degree, or for a doctorate, are often highly-advanced, difficult subjects, and they would be extremely difficult to understand unless a person had already attended the undergraduate courses. The reason the upper-level courses are so difficult, so hard to understand, is that they assume the person already knows, perhaps, 1,000 technical terms learned in earlier college courses. This is similar to having to know the Latin names of all 206 bones in the human body, as just part of those technical terms.

There are other types of college degrees as well.

Template:Convert/updates

The subtemplate Template:Convert/updates is just a documentation page to introduce the list of template edit-requests, which is on the related talk-page, . The strategy is to use that dedicated talk-page to contain multiple edit-requests, plus ample test-cases for each subtemplate, rather than create a separate talk-page, for each, to request an edit for every subtemplate, individually, as specified on an isolated page. Instead, all requests are combined on the single talk-page.

Once updates are made by admins, then the dedicated talk-page becomes a historical record, for all the combined edit-requests, rather than hunting through multiple talk-pages to review the details of each edit-request. They are all listed in a single talk-page for ease of review in later months.

Subset sum problem

The subset sum problem is an important problem of computer science. It can be stated as follows: Given a set of integers, does any subset of them sum to zero? For example, given the set { −7, −3, −2, 5, 8}, the answer is "yes" because the subset { −3, −2, 5} sums to zero. The problem is NP-Complete. It can be reformulated to the 3SAT.

Squat

Squat is a renowned element of many folk dances. 

In powerlifting and bodybuilding, as well as in other sports, squat is an exercise that strengthening the muscles of the thighs, hips and buttocks, as well as the bones, ligaments and insertion of the tendons throughout the lower body.

Although the squat is a basic element of weight training, it has been the subject of considerable controversy in recent years. Some trainers allege that squats are associated with injuries to the lumbar spine and knees. As a result, many trainers suggest that the standard barbell squat be modified in various ways. Others, however, reject all suggestions that the exercise be abandoned, continuing to advocate the squat.

<doc id="244351" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244351" title="John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury">
John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury

John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury PC, FRS (30 April 1834 – 28 May 1913), known as Sir John Lubbock, 4th Bt from 1865 until 1900, was an English banker, biologist, archaeologist and Liberal politician.

Lubbock was the son of Sir John Lubbock, 3rd Baronet, and was brought up in the family home of High Elms, near Downe in Kent. In 1842 his father brought home a "great piece of news". Young John Lubbock thought it might be a new pony, and was disappointed that the news was that Charles Darwin was moving to Down House in the village. He was soon a frequent visitor to Down House, and became the closest of Darwin's younger friends.

Lubbock was educated at Eton College from 1845 and afterwards was taken into his father's bank, where he became a partner at the age of twenty-two. In 1865 he succeeded to the baronetcy. 

In 1870, 1874, and 1880 he was elected to Parliament, where he promoted a number of laws. Lubbock was elected the first president of the Institute of Bankers in 1879; in 1881 he was president of the British Association, and from 1881 to 1886 president of the Linnean Society of London. In March 1883 he founded the Bank Clerks Orphanage, which in 1986 became the Bankers Benevolent Fund – a charity for bank employees, past and present and their dependants. In January 1884 he founded the Proportional Representation Society, later to become the Electoral Reform Society.

Lubbock received honorary degrees from the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Dublin and Würzburg; and in 1878 was appointed a trustee of the British Museum. From 1888 to 1892 he was president of the London Chamber of Commerce; from 1889 to 1890 vice-chairman and from 1890 to 1892 chairman of the London County Council.

In February 1890 he was appointed a Privy Councillor, and was chairman of the committee of design on the new coinage in 1891. In January 1900 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Avebury, his title commemorating the largest Neolithic site in Europe.

In 1865 Lubbock published what was possibly the most influential archaeological text book of the 19th Century, "Pre-historic times, as illustrated by ancient remains, and the manners and customs of modern savages". He invented the terms Palaeolithic and Neolithic to denote the Old and New Stone Ages respectively, but more notable was his introduction of a Darwinian view of human nature. 

Lubbock was also an amateur biologist of some distinction, writing books on hymenoptera, on insect sense organs and development, on the intelligence of animals, and on other natural history topics. He was a member of the famous X Club founded by T.H. Huxley to promote the growth of science in Britain. He discovered that ants were sensitive to the ultraviolet range of the spectrum. The Punch verse of 1882 captured him perfectly:

He carried out extensive correspondence with Charles Darwin, who lived nearby in Downe. In addition to their shared interest in natural history, both men were active advocates of spelling reform, and members of the Spelling Reform Association. When Darwin died in 1882, Lubbock suggested the honour of burial in Westminster Abbey, and was one of the pallbearers.

Georges Seurat

Georges-Pierre Seurat, (2 December 1859 – 29 March 1891) was a French Post-Impressionist painter. 

Seurat painted for a time with the Impressionist painters, Claude Monet, Renoir, Sisley and Pisarro. His scientific ideas about colour then led him to develop a different painting "technique" (a way of doing something). He painted in tiny dots of colour, with the theory that the viewer's eye would mix them. This technique is called "pointillism". 

Seurat and his followers are often referred to as the Neo-Impressionists ("New Impressionists"). His most famous paintings are "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte" (1884-1886) in the Chicago and "Bathers at Asnières" (1884) in the National Gallery, London.

Eugène Boudin

Eugène Boudin (12 July 1824 – 8 August 1898) was a French painter of landscapes and seascapes. He was one of the first landscape painters to paint outdoors, rather than in a studio. He was a great influence on the French Impressionists.

Boudin was born at Trouville, France, and was the son of a sailor. In 1835 his father opened a small shop in Le Havre where Boudin worked with him, selling stationery and making picture frames. Boudin met many artists who put their paintings for sale in the shop. In his early twenties, Boudin went to Paris to study painting. He returned often to paint the seashores around his home. 

In 1856 Boudin met Claude Monet who spent several months working with Boudin in his studio. The two remained lifelong friends. Monet later said that Boudin had been a major influence on him, teaching him to paint outdoors. Camille Corot who was one of the greatest influences on Monet and the other Impressionists, gazed at Boudin's work and said "You are the master of the sky." 

The Eugene Boudin Prize is an award given by the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts of France.

Boolean satisfiability problem

The Boolean satisfiability problem is a kind of problem. It is from math based logic. In propositional logic, a formula is "satisfiable" if the variables it uses can be given values so that it becomes true. It is important to know that for a given formula, no numbers exist so that the formula becomes true. In other words, the formula will always be false no matter what values its variables have. The formula is called "satisfiable" in the first case. It is called "unsatisfiable" in the second case. 

This problem is also known as "Boolean or propositional satisfiability". Computer scientists usually call it SAT. Complexity theory believes that the formula should be in a special form, known as conjunctive normal form. A formula that is in this form has clauses. Formulae are joined by a "logical and". Each clause has several literals. They are joined by a "logical or". A literal and its complement cannot appear in the same clause. The problem may also have other names. The names depend on what the logical formula looks like. The names also depend on how many variables are used per clause.

A formula that satisfies 3SAT looks like the following:

In this case "("A" OR "B" OR "C")" is an example for a clause, and "B" is one of the literals of this clause.

At the beginning of the 1970s, Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin showed that the problem is NP-complete. This is known as the Cook–Levin theorem. 

The problem 3SAT uses three variables per clause. It is one of the 21 NP-complete problems. They were defined by Richard Karp in 1972.

Denver Clayton Lemaster (born February 25, 1939 in Corona, California) was a Major League Baseball pitcher. He began his career when he was signed by the Milwaukee Braves. He spent 1958-early 1962 in the minors. He joined the Braves in 1962, and pitched his first game on June 15th. He played with the Braves until 1967. They had moved to Atlanta by that time. After the 1967 season he was traded to the Astros with Denis Menke. The Braves were given Sonny Jackson and Chuck Harrison. Lemaster played with the Astros for four years. He was then sold to the Montreal Expos, but was released halfway through the season.

NP-complete

In complexity theory, NP-complete is a complexity class for problems which have two basic properties:

A solution to such a problem can be verified quickly, but finding such a solution is very difficult. NP-complete problems can be characterised by the fact that no fast solution to them is known. Very often, the time or effort required to solve such a problem grows with the size of the problem. As a result, such problems can be solved if they are small. As an example, the Travelling salesman problem is one of the problems that is NP complete. As of 2010, it can be solved for routes of up to about hundred cities. Solving it for more cities will take too long. 

The question, whether these problems can be solved quickly is one of the most important of theoretical computer science. This question is generally known as P versus NP. 

Many of the problems encountered in computer science are NP-complete. Good programmers should be able to recognise that a problem is NP-complete. While solving such a problem exactly may take too long, it is often possible to find good approximation algorithms. Such algorithms will only solve a very specific case, or they may not work in certain cases, but they may provide a solution for the problem at hand, that works most of the time. 

In 1972, Richard Karp published an article called "Reducibility among combinatorial problems", in which he showed that 21 diverse combinatorial and graph theoretical problems are NP-complete. Each of these problems was known for its difficulty. 

In the article he showed that each of these problems can be changed to a different problem, which is known to be NP-complete. The new problem must therefore also be NP-complete.

Cook–Levin theorem

The Cook–Levin theorem is a theorem from theoretical computer science, which says that the Boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete. Any problem that is in NP can be changed so that to the Boolean satisfiability theorem. On a deterministic Turing machine this takes polynomial time. An important consequence of the theorem is that if there exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for solving Boolean satisfiability, then there exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for solving "all" problems in NP. The same follows for any NP-complete problem. 

The question of whether such an algorithm exists is called the P versus NP problem and it is widely considered the most important unsolved problem in theoretical computer science. The theorem is named after Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin.

The term "purchase" is a verb meaning "to buy", or a noun meaning an item obtained through a sale. However, the word has been used in many major historical terms, including:

The word "purchase" is often used in contracts with "acquisition", as in the term "Acquisitions and Mergers" (A&M) in legal agreements made between large companies. Those contracts typically state than a company was "purchased" by another company.

In common usage, the shorter word "buy" is typically used when shopping, rather than the word "purchase". In legal terms (legal words), the opposite of a purchase is called a "sale".

In a dig at Giza in 1928, scientists find a big metalic ring inscribed with hieroglyphics. Archeologist Doctor Daniel Jackson is called by the US Air Force to translate hieroglyphics on the ring. They find out that the ring is actually a piece of alien technology that creates wormholes to transport people across the universe. A military team goes through the stargate with Jackson, and after the journey find out that they cannot get back to earth. They find a city of ancient Egyptian-like people under the rule of Ra, who is an alien posing as their god.

Super Junior (Korean: 슈퍼주니어), also known as SJ or SuJu is a South Korean boy band, under SM Entertainment. It consists of thirteen boys: Leeteuk, Eunhyuk, Siwon, Ryeowook, Kyuhyun, Heechul, Han Geng, Kibum, Kangin, Sungmin, Shindong, Yesung, and Donghae. The oldest, Leeteuk is commonly seen as the leader of the group. It is currently the largest boy band in the world. However, the status of three of the members is currently unknown, because Han Geng has left SM Entertainment, Kibum is busy with acting activities, and Kangin has enlisted into the South Korean military.

They have released four albums: Super Junior 05 (TWINS) with only twelve members. Kyuhyun joined later during the release of the song "U". They then released three more, with the full set of thirteen members: Don't Don in 2007; SORRY SORRY in 2009, and their latest: Bonamana, 2010. Sorry, Sorry excludes Kangin due to suspension, and Bonamana excludes Kangin, Han Geng, and Kibum. 

Super Junior is led by their leader Leeteuk, or Park Jung Su, and has four lead dancers: Eunhyuk, Shindong, Donghae, and Han Geng, and also has four lead singers: Ryeowook, Kyuhyun, Yesung, and Sungmin. Ryeowook, Kyuhyun, and Yesung belong in a subgroup called Super Junior K.R.Y. All members except Kibum have been put into these subgroups: Super Junior Trot, Super Junior M, and Super Junior Happy.

Super Junior KRY sings many slow songs that show-off the voices of the singer.
Super Junior T sings songs in a trot style.
Super Junior M sings in Chinese and their main audience is not Korean, but Chinese.
Super Junior Happy sing very bright and happy songs.

Gnathostomulida

Gnathostomulids, or jaw worms, are a small phylum of marine invertebrates which were discovered in 1956. They are tiny worm-like marine animals. They inhabit sand and mud beneath shallow coastal waters and can survive in relatively anoxic environments. 

Most gnathostomulids measure 0.5 to 1 millimetre (0.02 to 0.04 in) in length. They are slender to thread-like worms, with a transparent body. The neck region is slightly narrower than the rest of the body, giving them a distinct head. 

Like flatworms they have a ciliated epidermis, but are unique in having but one cilium per cell. The cilia allow the worms to glide along in the water between sand grains, although they also have muscles that allow the body to twist or contract. 

They have no circulatory or respiratory system. The nervous system is very simple, and restricted to the outer layers of the body wall. The only sense organs are modified cilia, which are especially common in the head region.

The mouth is just behind the head, on the underside of the body. It has a pair of muscular jaws supplied with minute teeth, and a plate on the lower surface that bears a comb-like structure which they use to scrape smaller organisms off of the grains of sand that make up their anoxic seabed mud habitat. The mouth opens into a blind-ending tube in which digestion takes places; there is no anus. 

There are approximately 100 described species and certainly many more as yet undescribed. Gnathostomulids have no fossil record.

Gnathostomulids are simultaneous hermaphrodites. Each individual possesses a single ovary and one or two testes. After fertilisation, the single egg ruptures through the body wall and adheres to nearby sand particles; the parent is able to rapidly heal the resulting wound. The egg hatches into a miniature version of the adult, without a larval stage.

The epidermis is the skin or surface layer of an animal or plant. At its most basic, it is a sheet of cells. The cells are continually replaced by cell division (mitosis), and the layer (in animals) is sensitive to stimuli such as touch. In land vertebrates the epidermis has many layers; the outer layers may be reinforced by keratin.

2010 Pacific hurricane season

2010 Pacific hurricane season started on May 15, 2010 and will end on November 30, 2010. These dates are when a storm is likely to start in 2010. The first storm of this season formed about two weeks before the first storm of 2009 did. So far, there have been five tropical depression, four of those five became a tropical storm, while only one because a hurricane. In addition, one storm, Hurricane Celia, became a major hurricane which is category 3 or greater.

The first storm, Tropical Storm Agatha killed at least 196 people in Central America. No other storms in the 2010 Pacific hurricane season have affected land yet. 

The first storm of the season started from a tropical disturbance, which is similar to a tropical wave. This tropical disturbance grew into Tropical Depression One-E on May 29. Tropical Depression One quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and it was given the name "Agatha". Moving toward land, Tropical Storm Agatha peak as a weak tropical storm with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Tropical Storm Agatha had made landfall near the Mexico and Guatemala border. Agatha had quickly died over land on May 30 after moving northward. 

Tropical Storm Agatha killed about 146 people in Central America. 

Tropical Depression Two-E started on June 16 from a tropical wave. Moving just south of the Mexican coast, winds top at 30 mph (45 km/h), which was too low for a storm to be a tropical storm. Remaining off the coast, Tropical Depression Two-E dissipated on June 17 without becoming a tropical storm.

Rains from Tropical Depression Two-E caused flooding, which damage about 82 houses and affected 40 other houses near the coast. In addition, some people lost there roofs because of high winds. No people were killed by Tropical Depression Two-E. 

On June 17, Tropical Depression Four-E started from an area of low pressure. Tropical Depression Four-E strengthened fast, and had become Tropical Storm Blas just one hour later. Blas became a strong tropical storm and had its highest winds at 65 mph (100 km/h) on June 19. It began to weakened slowly as it headed into colder waters. The next day, Blas weakened to a tropical depression and died the following day, June 21. Tropical Storm Blas remained far enough from land to cause no affects. 

Celia formed from an area of low pressure on June 19, and quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and then a hurricane. On June 21 Celia became a Category 2 hurricane and on June 23 strengthened further to become a Category 3 for a little while before weakening again due to bad conditions. After these bad conditions disappeared, Celia strengthened again and became a Category 5 hurricane on June 24, and the strongest storm of the season so far. However Celia moved into a part of the ocean with dry air above it and Celia weakened to a tropical storm quickly, before dying out completely. Celia was far enough away from land to not cause any damage.

The following names will be used for named storms that form in East Pacific in 2010. Names that were not used are marked in , and names in bold are storms currently active. This list is the same as it was in the 2004 season. 

For the central Pacific Ocean, four names are used. A central Pacific name is given if a named storm starts near Hawaii. The next four names are shown here:

There are several standard chess diagram templates:


There are also templates for chess variants: 


The syntax is basically the same for all of them.

Parameters:


A square is defined by the name of piece or empty parameter. The names of the pieces are those given in algebraic notation:


There are also some fairy chess pieces available:


These letters are combined with either "l" for Light=White, or "d" for Dark=Black. So "kl" is White's king, and "nd" is Black's knight. 

An empty square is written either using underscores, spaces, or nothing at all. Two spaces are recommended.


You can also use "xx" for a cross, "xo" for a black circle on an empty square or "oo" for a white one.


Numbers can also be added to squares by using "x0" for 0, "x1" for 1, "x2" for 2, ..., "x9" for 9. 


In the following examples the rows and columns are numbered. Because any text between "|=" and the next "|" is ignored, numbers and letters can be added without affecting output. 

This diagram is recommended for common use as a main diagram in the articles on chess openings, endings, games, positions etc. See the corresponding code below.

It may be convenient to use this in the articles on chess problems. Please note that in the header and footer you can use bolds or "italics". You can also use codice_7 to break the lines.

See the corresponding code below. If you don't want the captions, just remove them, but don't delete the second "|" pipe character for the caption above; it is possible to delete the last pipe for the longer caption below.

The diagram floats to the left to illustrate the use of the first parameter.

This one may be useful in articles with many diagrams. It uses another template named .

The small diagrams can have header, too.

Chess boards of non-standard dimensions need special templates. There are templates for

Regeneration

Regeneration is to regrow a lost part, so that the original function is restored. It is a term in in developmental biology.

The ability to regenerate differs in different groups. Whereas newts, for example, can regenerate severed limbs, mammals cannot. Limb regeneration in newts occurs in two major steps, first de-differentiation of adult cells into a stem cell state similar to embryonic cells and second, development of these cells into new tissue more or less the same way it developed the first time. 

Simpler animals like flatworms can regenerate because the adults retain clusters of stem cells in their bodies. These can migrate to damaged parts of the body, then divide and differentiate to provide the missing tissue.

Zombie 4

Zombie 4.1 was a movie from 1967 which featured a cast of Samuel O'Gorman who plays Jack Marsh; Harrison Cleaver who plays Jonny Carlman; Benjamin Ford who plays Muhammed Mohammed and Max Coleman who plays Phoebe Dulard.

It is about 3 friends which go on holiday only to discover that their dream holiday destination was completely abandoned and infested with nightmarish zombie foes. Together, they must fight to survive. Will they help each other, or will it turn into a brutish free-for-all.

Jack Marsh, a young student from West Philadelphia, had just finished his final examinations so decides to celebrate with a weekend away with 3 of his friends; Jonny Carlman (Harrison Cleaver); Muhammed Mohammed (Benjamin Ford) and Phoebe Dulard (Max Coleman). 

The director of this movie, Nosirrah Revaelc, is known for his hellish horrors with other classics such as "Night of the living zombies" and "Dawn of the Zombies". Nosirrah was critically acclaimed for Zombie 4.1, which won 2 golden globes.

Nosirrah started his career at a young age of 17, when he worked with famous director Vafa Motemedi on the set of "The Window to Hell". After producers saw what astounding work Nossirah was making, his big break followed with "Zombie 1", which won three golden globes. However, the highly anticipated Zombie 2 & 3 was a disappointment, with critics saying "Nossirah is a one hit wonder". At the age of 36, he proved them wrong, returning with the block buster movie "Night of the Living Zombies". Nossirah died as of a cardiac arrest in the early hours of 22nd November 1975, at the age of 72.

Context (computing)

In computer science, a task context (process, thread ...) is the minimal set of data used by this task that must be saved to allow a task interruption at a given date, and a continuation of this task at the point it has been interrupted and at an arbitrary future date. The concept of context assumes significance in the case of interruptible tasks, wherein upon being interrupted the processor saves the context and proceeds to serve the Interrupt service routine. Thus the smaller the context the smaller is the latency.
These data are located in:
The storage memory (files) is not concerned by the "task context" in the case of a context switch; even if this can be stored for some uses (checkpointing).

Ecchi

Ecchi (or Etchi, from the Japanese エッチ "etchi")comes from the Japanese word meaning "lewd", "sexy", "pervert", or "naughty" when used as an adjective, or it can mean to have sexual intercourse when it is used as a verb or noun. The English use of this word is usually used in manga and anime and it is used when the anime or manga has sexual content, such as skimpy clothing or partial or full nudity, but does not show sexual intercourse.

Ecchi anime usually contains a lot of fan service or nudity, sometimes both. Ecchi anime is also sometimes filled with innuendo and sexual humor. Ecchi anime doesn’t show sex, at least not in a graphical way. Ecchi anime is more similar to an R rated movie with a lot of sexual overtones, such as American Pie.

It would seem that ecchi is similar to hentai, though it doesn’t go as far. There is a possibility that the term itself comes from the word hentai, but the origins are unclear. A literal translation of ecchi means “h”. 

A character in anime is often called ecchi, or even hentai, when he is perceived as being a pervert. In an anime like Love Hina it’s usually because of a comedic mistake or blunder.

Ganglion

In anatomy, a ganglion (plural ganglia) is a biological tissue mass, part of the nervous system. It is a mass of nerve cell bodies. 

With invertebrates, ganglia often do the work of a brain. In these cases, like the earthworm, there is a ganglion above the gut at the front. This is linked to another under the gut by nerve fibres running down each side of the gut. The rest of the central nervous system runs under the gut. This type of arrangement in found in a number of invertebrate phyla, and contrasts with the vertebrates, who have their spinal cord above their gut.

In another usage, ganglion cells are found in the retina of the vertebrate eye.

Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder

Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is a personality disorder. People with OCPD are with rules and order, and can feel worried or angry when things do not seem right. This can lead to routines and rules for ways of doing things, for themselves and the people around them.

People with OCPD pay an unusual amount of attention to details, rules, lists, order, organization, and schedules. It is very hard to get them to change their minds. They are perfectionist and want themselves to always be working and doing it right. Because of this, they are afraid to let other people do things in case they do it wrong.

Some people with OCPD, but not all of them, have a strong need to be clean. Those that do not show this tendency are sometimes good at setting up systems to keep clean, but may not follow through with the need to clean because of other "more important" things. For example, the need to finish a project at work might cause the OCPD person to have a quite unorganized home. But if that same person was suddenly unemployed or finished with other things, they could very well start becoming more concerned about being clean as they have more free time.

OCPD people sometimes do not finish things on time because too much time is used in getting it to be just right. Friends and family are often under serious strain because the OCPD individual must be in charge and the only one who knows what is right. Not being clean or tidy enough is seen by some OCPD individuals as not being perfect enough. They may regularly spend a lot of time putting things in exactly the right place in exactly the right way. OCPD sufferers can be worried about things going wrong in their lives, and hoard money just in case.

For a person with fully-developed OCPD, actions and beliefs are either completely right or completely wrong, and they are always right. Because of this, interpersonal relationships are difficult as the person demands too much of their friends, partners and children. When people do not do what they want, sometimes people with OCPD turn to anger and even violence. They often suffer from depression. This can sometimes be so serious that they may commit suicide. One study suggests that disorders like OCPD can make people more depressed than actually having clinical depression.

People with OCPD, when anxious or excited, may have tics, pull faces, or make noises, like people with Tourette syndrome, or do and surprising things.

Red Dead Redemption

Red Dead Redemption is an action-adventure western video game made by Rockstar San Diego. It was released in May 2010 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It is a spiritual successor to 2004's "Red Dead Revolver".

"Red Dead Redemption" gives the player a big and open world environment. This allows the player to move freely. Players on foot can walk, talk, shoot, kill, ride, run, interact with the environment. Players may also fight enemies with firearms. Different breeds of horses is how the player mainly gets around. Players cannot go Swimming, because the main character John Marston cannot swim and will drown if the player goes too far into the water (though he is able to go where the water is shallow).

The open world environment allows players to choose how they want to play. Storyline missions are for progress. Players can also take part in many events they come across as they explore the world. Some examples are public hangings, ambushes, cries for help, and animal attacks. Players can also take part in optional side activities ranging from standoffs, gambling, and hunting animals for pelts and meat.

"Red Dead Redemption" makes use of a honesty system. This is when players have the chance to get good or bad 'honor'. Some of the ways to get good honor are like taking an outlaw alive instead of killing him, or saving a kidnapped person. Bad honor can be gotten for doing crimes like killing and/or robbing people. This works along with another system, 'fame,' showing and governing how people react based on Marston's honor status.

A trailer of the game was sent to a select number of people at a Sony meeting in 2005. It helped the release of the PlayStation 3 system. The trailer was a tech demo of Rockstar Advanced Game Engine. It was set in a western setting thought to as "Old West Project" and a sequel to "Red Dead Revolver". The trailer flowed throughout the internet. In the April edition of "Game Informer", "Red Dead Redemption" was listed as being for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

On February 3, 2009, Rockstar Games showed the first official trailer. Resulting trailers had many characters, gameplay features, and multiplayer modes that will be shown in the final release. The game was shown on NASCAR driver Joey Logano's number 20 Toyota Camry in the Nationwide Series running of the O'Reilly 300. This took place at the Texas Motor Speedway on April 17, 2010. In North America, television network Fox plans to show a half-hour in-game special. It will be directed by John Hillcoat on May 29, 2010.

In North America, GameStop and Rockstar worked with each other on a pre-order bonus. This bonus would let customers vote for one of three outfits that Marston could unlock in the game. Each outfit came with a different bonus. For example, the "Deadly Assassin" outfit allows Marston to restart slow-mo "Dead-Eye" targeting twice as fast. The "Savvy Merchant" outfit would cut in half the purchasing price of ammunition and guns and double the selling price for ammunition and guns. And the "Expert Hunter" outfit would double the amount of money the player could get from selling hides of animals. Voting was open to all, but only those who pre-ordered the game through Gamestop will get the winning outfit, the "Deadly Assassin".

Along with the GameStop pre-order special, there are many other pre-order bonuses through other game stores. These game stores are throughout North America, Europe, and Australia. These are the "War Horse" and the "Golden Guns". The "War Horse" is a black horse with a white mane, tail and markings thought as "rare" as well as being "faster" and having "more health" than any other horse in the game. The "Golden Guns" reward increases fame with each kill. This allows users to progress much faster up the ladder of fame. The official online Rockstar Games store, the "Rockstar Warehouse," offers a "Red Dead Redemption" T-shirt as the pre-order bonus. With some countries getting the "Golden Guns" and the "War Horse," all will have the Deadly Assassin outfit along with the first soundtrack.
Limited additional showings such as a new gang hideout and a walton gang outfit, is available for the PlayStation 3 version of the game. Plus, some awards in the game unlock rewards for PlayStation Home, PlayStation 3's online social gaming network.

"Red Dead Redemption Original Soundtrack" is the soundtrack of video game music from the game "Red Dead Redemption". The music was mostly made by Friends of Dean Martinez member Bill Elm and ex-member Woody Jackson along with some other people from many musicians like Swedish folk musician José González.

The game has been met with worldwide cheering. It also got a lot of good reviews from the views of the open world, story, and soundtrack. The game has gotten a 95/100 on both Metacritic and GameRankings. On Metacritic, it is the 5th best rated Xbox 360 game of all time and the 3rd best rated PlayStation 3 game of all time. On GameRankings both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game are on the "All-Time Best" video game list.

"The New York Times" game review reporter said, ""In the more than 1,100 articles I have written for this newspaper since 1996, I have never before called anything a tour de force. Yet there is no more succinct and appropriate way to describe "Red Dead Redemption"."

IGN gave good reviews on the game giving it a 9.7/10. They said, ""What is most impressive about this sandbox is how fun it is to simply hop on a horse and take off across the prairie"." In the end they said ""Red Dead Redemption is a must-play game. Rockstar has taken the Western to new heights and created one of the deepest, most fun, and most gorgeous games around. You can expect the occasional bug or visual hiccup, but you can also expect a fantastic game that offers the Western experience we've all been waiting for"." GameSpot awarded the game 9.5/10 and said that it "raises the bar for open world action games".

GameSpy gave it 5/5 stars saying ""With Red Dead Redemption, Rockstar succeeds in creating one of the most impressive open worlds I've ever seen in a game, and it's telling that — even after playing for over 30 hours — all I want to do is get back on my horse and gallop back into the wilderness"." VideoGamer gave it a 10/10 saying ""The game itself is absolutely spectacular... The sheer quality of Red Dead Redemption is evident right from the word go." They also said "it's a magnificent piece of work that everybody should play"."

Eurogamer gave Red Dead Redemption an 8/10, saying ""successfully re-clothes the Grand Theft Auto framework in an exciting, distinct and expertly realised scenario"".

Hypertrophy

Hypertrophy (from Greek ὑπέρ "excess" + τροφή "nourishment") is the increase in the volume of an organ or tissue due to the enlargement of its component cells. It should be distinguished from "hyperplasia", in which the cells remain approximately the same size but increase in number. Although hypertrophy and hyperplasia are two distinct processes, they frequently occur together, such as in the case of the hormonally-induced proliferation and enlargement of the cells of the uterus during pregnancy.

One of the two most common and visible forms of organ hypertrophy occurs in skeletal muscles in response to strength training or bodybuilding.

Spiritual successor

A Spiritual successor, sometimes called a Spiritual sequel or a Companion piece, is a sequel to a work of fiction which does not have the same storyline made in the first. Spiritual successors still have the same elements, themes, and styles as the first.

The nature of the publisher/maker system are basic in almost all computer games. As well as the purchase and takeovers by many companies. These are reasons why creative teams often lose to keep the copyright and trademark rights of what they made. This often makes attempts to make sequels for a product not possible for many reasons. One of the reasons it the "core" of the studio being fired or taken over after finishing a project while the parent company keeps control of the copyrights and trademarks. A good example of this strategy is Electronic Arts. They have closed many studios while keeping their copyrights and trademarks, such as Bullfrog Productions, Origin Systems, and Westwood Studios.

To get around this, creative teams will make a product that is kind of like the first game in some way, without copying the first directly. For example, the video games "TimeSplitters" and, "Perfect Dark" are often thought to be the spiritual successors to the hit video game "GoldenEye 007".

Other times, a spiritual successor is made when the first products were either poor commercial sellers and/or forgotten by the people that would purchase the product. By leaving the first product's name and maybe its baggage as a forgotten product, the spiritual sequel can be loved by fresh eyes. An example of this would be "BioShock", which has been named to by its makers as the spiritual successor to "System Shock 2". "System Shock" and "System Shock 2" both got good reviews, but both failed to get the expected commercial success. Unlike "BioShock", which was both a reviewer and commercial success.

William Ford Gibson was born in Conway, South Carolina on the Atlantic coast. He spent most of his childhood in Wytheville, Virginia. Whytheville is a small town in the Appalachians. His parents had been born and raised there.

Gibson was shy and awkward as a teenager. He grew up in a place and time where most people thought and acted alike. This was a problem for him. He chose not to believe in religion. He read science fiction and writers such as William S. Burroughs and Henry Miller. Gibson was not doing well in school and his mother was frustrated. She threatened to send him to a boarding school. She was very surprised when he liked this idea very much.

Gibson's mother died when he was eighteen years old. He left school and did not graduate. He traveled a lot. He became very interested in the counterculture. He left the United States and moved to Canada during the Vietnam War draft.

Gibson finished a graduate degree about science fiction. He stopped writing for one year. He did not like the trends he saw in SF. He was more interested in punk rock. He met other writers such as Bruce Sterling, Lewis Shiner, and Rudy Rucker. These writers became the important members of the cyberpunk movement in SF.

Gibson's first published short story was "Fragments of a Hologram Rose" (1977). He wrote other short stories for magazines such as Omni. He was often compared to J. G. Ballard. Some of the characters and places in his short stories are also in his Sprawl novels.

Terry Carr asked Gibson to write "Neuromancer" for the third series of Ace Science Fiction Specials. The purpose of the series was to give attention to first-time novelists.

"Neuromancer" was a success and Gibson kept writing SF. "The Sprawl trilogy" continued the story of Neuromancer, even though Gibson did not plan to write any sequels. Then he explored other ideas. "The Difference Engine" was alternat history. In "The Bridge trilogy", Gibson wrote about new problems. He paid less attention to large corporations or artificial intelligence. He wrote more about mass media and celebrity.

Gibson's later books are more realistic. They include Pattern Recognition, Spook Country, and Zero History.

He has written short stories and novels with others, especially other cyberpunk authors John Shirley and Bruce Sterling.
There have been many attempts to make films based on Gibson's writing. Most of these have never been completed.
Gibson has written poems too. He has also worked with artists, architects, and musicians.

In 1990, Gibson was part of an exhibit at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art called "Visionary San Francisco". He wrote a short story, "Skinner's Room", that took place in San Francisco. In the story, the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge was closed and became a community for homeless people. Architects Ming Fung and Craig Hodgetts were interested in the story and imagined a future San Francisco. Their idea of the future showed rich people living in high-tech towers above a city that was falling apart. Gibson was part of the architects' exhibit. Visitors could watch a video of him discussing the future and reading from the story "Skinner's Room". Another version of the short story appeared a year later in "Omni magazine".

In 1993, Gibson wrote some lyrics for the album "Technodon" by the Japanese group Yellow Magic Orchestra. He was the vocalist on the track ""Hi-Tech Hippies"". He wrote lyrics to the track ""Dog Star Girl"" on Deborah Harry's "Debravation".

Gibson sometimes writes nonfiction for newspapers or magazines. He has written essays, opinion-editorials, and commentary for publications such as: "Wired", "The New York Times", "The Observer", "Addicted to Noise", "New York Times Magazine", "Rolling Stone", and "Details Magazine".

In his fiction and non-fiction, Gibson often writes about cities. He thinks many cities are losing variety. One way of describing this is "Disneylanding".
Many writers believe that Gibson helped science fiction become cool. 
His work seemed did not just predict the future of technology such as the World Wide Web. The ideas in his books were important to the people who created Internet technology.

Heart urchin

Heart urchins are burrowing echinoids. This life-style is similar to that of sand dollars, but the heart urchins belong to another group. Heart urchins belong to the Family Loveniidae in the Order Spatangoida.

"Echinocardium" is the standard British heart urchin on sandy shores. Its spicules are converted to soft form, and they have sticky tube-feet which pass food to their gut. They can burrow up to five times their own height, and still keep connection with the surface for oxygenated water and food.

<doc id="245424" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=245424" title="Easter Island">
Easter Island

Easter Island is a Polynesian island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeastern most point of the Polynesian triangle. The capital city is Hanga Roa. It is famous for its 887 huge statues called Moai, created by the early Rapanui people. Easter Island also has a huge crater called Rano Kau at the edge of the island In the crater there is a natural lake and it is one of the only three bodies of fresh water on the island. Easter Island a World Heritage Site (as determined by UNESCO) with much of the island protected within the Rapa Nui National Park. In recent times the island has served as a cautionary tale about the cultural and environmental dangers of overexploitation. Ethnographers and archaeologists now say that the introduction of diseases carried by European colonizers and the slave raiding, that devastated the population in the 1800s had a much greater social than environmental impact. Introduced animals, first rats and then sheep, were largely responsible for the island's loss of native flora.

The history of Easter Island is rich and controversial. Its inhabitants have suffered famines, civil war, slave raids, and near total loss of forests. The population has declined steeply more than once. The islanders have left a cultural legacy that has famous. 300–400 CE was thought to be the date of the first settlement of Easter Island, which is about the same time as the arrival of the first settlers on Hawaii. However, new results in radiocarbon dating have changed almost all of the early settlement dates in Polynesia and Rapa Nui is now considered to have been settled between 700 to 1,100 CE. Oral tradition says that the first settlement was in Anakena. The island was most probably settled by Polynesians who navigated in canoes or catamarans from the Marquesas Islands, 3,200 km (2,000 miles) away, or the Gambier Islands (Mangareva, 2,600 km (1,600 miles) away. When Captain Cook visited the island, one of his crew members, who was a Polynesian from Bora Bora, was able to communicate with the Rapa Nui. The language most similar to Rapa Nui is Mangarevan with about 80% of similar words. In 1999, they reached Easter Island from Mangareva in 19 days. According to oral traditions written down by missionaries in the 1860s, the island originally had a very clear class system, with an ariki, high chief, who had great power over nine other clans and their chiefs. 
The high chief was the eldest descendent, through firstborn lines, of the island's legendary founder, Hotu Matu'a. The most visible part of the culture was the making of very large statues called moai that represented deified ancestors. It was believed that the living had a relationship with the dead where the dead provided everything the living needed (health, fertility of land and animals, fortune, etc.,) and the living through offerings could provide the dead with a better place in the spirit world. Most settlements were located on the coast and moai were erected all along the coastline, watching over their descendants in the settlements before them, with their backs toward the spirit world in the sea. 

The most important myths are:
Tangata manu, the Birdman cult which was practiced until the 1860s.
Makemake, is an important god.
Aku-aku, the guardians of the sacred family caves.
Moai-kava-kava a ghost man of the Hanau epe (long-ears.)

The climate of Easter Island is subtropical maritime. The lowest temperatures are in July and August (18 °C) and the highest in February (maximum temperature 28 °C), the summer season in the southern hemisphere. Winters are quite mild. The rainiest month is April, though the island has year-round rainfall. As an isolated island Easter Island is constantly exposed to winds which help to keep the temperature fairly cool. Rainfall averages 1,118 millimetres or 44 inches per year. Occasionally, heavy rainfall and rainstorms strike the island. These occur mostly in the winter months (June-August). Cyclones and hurricanes do not occur around Easter Island.

Appin, New South Wales

Appin is a town in New South Wales, Australia in Wollondilly Shire. It is situated about 16 kilometres south of Campbelltown and 35 kilometres north west of Wollongong. In 2006 there were 1,423 people living in Appin. The fifth village settled in Australia, it is now on the fringe of the Sydney urban area.

The town was named by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1811 after a small village on the coast of Scotland where his wife was born. One of the first settlers was John Hume, whose son Hamilton Hume became a famous Australian explorer. Hamilton Hume explored the local area and was given a grant of 300 acres of land at Appin as a reward. When he made his famous journey to Victoria with William Hovell in 1824, they started the journey from Appin.

Appin is the birthplace of John Fuller (1830-1865), the Australian bushranger also known as Dan Morgan.

Cataract Gorge is about 10km south east of Appin. It is now has a dam built in 1906 which is the oldest dam in the Sydney water supply system. On 17 April, 1816 the British army killed many Aboriginal men, women and children, of the Dharawal Nation at the gorge. They had been fighting the European settlers who were moving into the area.

The Roman Catholic church at Appin, St. Bede's, was built from 1837-1843. The design was by Father John Therry (1790-1864), who became Australia's first Catholic priest in 1820. St. Bede's is the oldest Catholic church still in continous use. It was named after St. Bede, the founder of the Benedictines.

Constable

A constable is a person doing a certain job, most commonly in law enforcement. The work and role of a constable can vary a lot in different countries.

Historically, the word "constable" comes from the Latin, "comes stabuli", count of the stables. It came from the Eastern Roman Empire. Originally, the constable was the person who kept the horses of a lord or monarch. The title was later used in the monarchies of medieval Europe. In many countries, the constable became a high military rank and great officer of State such as, the Constable of France.

In modern times, constables are law enforcement officers. In the United Kingdom, Commonwealth of Nations and some European countries, a constable is the lowest rank of police officer. In the United States a constable is usually an elected peace officer, with less powers than a sheriff. However, in the Channel Islands a constable is an elected office-holder at the parish level.

Historically, a constable could also be someone in charge of the defence of a castle. Even today, there is a Constable of the Tower of London.

It is a similar position to Marshal, which comes from Old High German "marah" "horse" and "schalh" "servant", and originally meant "stable keeper", which has a similar etymology.

Monaro (New South Wales)

Monaro (pronounced "mon-air'-ro") is the name of a region in the south of New South Wales, Australia. A small area of Victoria near Snowy River National Park is also part of the Monaro. The Australian Capital Territory is often considered part of the region: most towns have very close links with Canberra.

The Monaro region is a plateau area about above sea level. It lies between the valley of the Murrumbidgee River in the north, and the Errinundra Plateau in the south. It drops steeply to the coast on its eastern side. Much of the region is an ancient highland, but there is basaltic bedrock near Cooma and Nimmitabel. This produces the only true chernozems in Australia. These are some of the best soils in in the whole country. Elsewhere the granitic soils are very infertile, supporting a dry forest vegetation before clearing for pastures.

Because it is located east of the Snowy Mountains, the rain-bearing westerly winds drop rain and snow on the mountains leaving the Monaro region in a rain shadow. Annual rainfall ranges from 430 millimeters around Dalgety to 700 millimetres at the eastern edge of the plateau. Occasional storms can produce very heavy rainfall. In one day in June 1975, Nimmitabel received 256 millimetres (over 10 inches) of rain. Temperatures in summer are warm to very warm. The average maximum temperatures range from 28 °C (82 °F) around Canberra and Queanbeyan to 22 °C (71 °F) on the highest parts of the plateau. Nights in summer can be cool, but in winter the region is the coldest part of mainland Australia outside the Alps, with July minima averaging -0.3 °C (31.5 °F) in Canberra and -1.5 °C (29.3 °F) in Bombala.

The Monaro region features rolling hills that rise to very rugged peaks in the Tinderry Mountains. There are shallow valleys in the upper Murrumbidgee. The basaltic Monaro Range separates the Snowy and Murrumbidgee drainages. Because the climate in the basaltic areas is too cold for crops, the main industry is raising sheep and beef cattle.

The Monaro Highway is the main State highway from Canberra to the Monaro region. The main towns in the region are Cooma and Bombala, others include Berridale, Adaminaby, Delegate, Dalgety, Nimmitabel and Jindabyne.

Halifax (bank)

Halifax is a major bank in the United Kingdom. It was a building society, but 'demutualised' and became a bank. The Halifax then merged with the Bank of Scotland and made up HBOS. In 2009 HBOS merged with Lloyds TSB and made Lloyds Banking Group. Until 2010 the Halifax was also an estate agent.

The Halifax started in 1853 as the Halifax Permanent Benefit Building and Investment Society at the Old Cock Inn in Halifax, West Yorkshire. The building society was created to allow working-class people in Halifax to invest their money in a local and 'mutual' organisation.

In 1928 it merged with the Halifax Equitable Building Society and changed its name to the Halifax Building Society. In 1973 the Halifax built its headquarters on Trinity Road in Halifax. By the 1990s the Halifax was the largest building society in Britain, now Halifax is a bank the largest is the Nationwide.

In 1995 the Halifax merged with the Leeds Permanent Building Society, this new larger building society then bought out Clerical Medical Find Managers.

In 1997 the Halifax became a bank and registered with the London Stock Exchange.

By 1997 the Halifax was the fifth largest bank in the United Kingdom and had joined the 'big four' to make it a 'big five'.

The Halifax continued to grow and in 1999 the Halifax bought out the Birmingham Midshires Building Society and Comparetheloan. In 1999 the Halifax set up Intelligent Finance', which was a telephone based bank.

In 2001 the Halifax merged with the Bank of Scotland and former Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS). Both brands were kept although some Halifax branches in Scotland became 'Bank of Scotland' and Bank of Scotland branches in Ireland became 'Halifax' branches. This was done because the Bank of Scotland was much larger in Scotland than the Halifax, while Halifax was much larger in Ireland than the Bank of Scotland and had spent a lot of money advertising of Irish television.

In January 2009 HBOS was acquired by Lloyds TSB which subsequently became Lloyds Banking Group. The Halifax is now just a brand name used by this group.

The bank has its main offices in Halifax town centre. It also has other major offices in Copley (near Halifax) and Leeds The Leeds offices used to belong to the Leeds Permanent Building Society. There are also offices in Aylesbury, Nottingham and Buckinghamshire.

Now the Halifax is part of Lloyds Banking Group there are also many former Lloyds, Bank of Scotland and TSB offices. Some services have been centralised, leading to job losses at some offices.

It was announced on June 30th 2010 that the Nottingham office is to close at the end of 2011. It has been confirmed by banking officials from Lloyds that a total of 198 jobs will be lost as a result.

The Halifax has branches all over the United Kingdom and also has 44 in Ireland (although these are to close). Many Halifax branches used to belong to the Leeds Permanent Building Society, which was taken-over by the Halifax in 1995.

Landlord

A landlord is a kind of businessperson or company who owns buildings or land, and earns money by charging rent to people (tenants) who want to use them. The word originated in the Middle Ages because a person who owned land then was also its lord who was in charge of the local government. Many natural persons who are landlords use borrowed money to buy their real estate and depend on enough tenants paying their rent on time, more for the purpose of reducing the amount of money they owe on the property than to provide them with an income.

Donald Trump is an example of a well known modern landlord.

Neith was one of the earliest goddesses of ancient Egypt. She was the patroness of the city Sais in the River Nile Delta. Several Egyptian queens of the first Dynasty were named after her. The people of lower Egypt prayed to her statues when they were sick or to keep them safe from harm. Every year the people held a great festival in her honor, called the Feast of Lamps, because at night, they burned lots of lights in the open air during the celebration.

Neith was also known as "The Warrior Goddess," "The creator Goddess," "The Mother Goddess," "The Goddess of Lower Egypt," "The Goddess of Funerals or Funerary Goddess." In Drawings of her, she wore the Red Crown of Lower Egypt, and sometimes she was shown holding a bow and arrows. Neith lost some of her power in the Middle Kingdom, but remained a goddess right to the end of Egypt's history.

Neith was the goddess of war and hunting. It was her responsibility to help settle wars and disputes between the gods and the Egyptians. The Egyptian warriors believed they could not win a war without praying to her.

The team captain of a football team is a team member who is chosen to be the leader during a football match. Mostly a captain is an older or more experienced player. A team captain often wears an armband.

The captain has to participate in the coin toss before the match and before a penalty shootout. Referees mostly talk to the captain about the behaviour of him and his team mates. When the team wins a trophy it is given to the captain.

This has been discussed before, but I have two separate suggestions:

I think part of the reason we get so little traffic is that if you're looking at the languages, you're not going to specifically look under S for Simple English. It is not a language that intuitively exists in its alphabetical order; it would be more logical to subgroup it just under English. S is too far down the alphabet for people to stumble across the interwiki link by browsing the bar.

There are templates linking to Wikibooks and Commons, stating that there is related material on the other project.

I thought one could be made to be added to articles on En that are lengthy or scientific- to which we have a good counterpart. How's this? {{||}} 09:50, 12 May 2010 (UTC)
I agree with this last proposal. Seems good. :) -- 23:35, 12 May 2010 (UTC)

If enWP agrees, I'd go for it, but only for our best articles (GA/VGA?). () 23:36, 12 May 2010 (UTC)

I think your heart is in the right place, but this just isn't feasible. If an article is too complex, a user isn't going to scroll to the bottom to look for an external link template, and that's exactly where this would be. Nobody on enwiki will want to place it at the top of the article; that's where the infobox lives, and the infobox is of far greater importance to a wider audience than a Simple English-linking box. // // // 06:39, 13 May 2010 (UTC)

Other than reverting vandalism and adding citations, what else can i do here? 06:00, 15 May 2010 (UTC)

There is a ton to be done. Another thing you might want to explore is this list. All the articles on there are tagged as having too many redlinks. You can go through the articles and create the new articles to turn the red to blue. () 10:41, 15 May 2010 (UTC)

Is there a list of Wikipedians by edit count? It would be interesting to see that list. I saw it referenced on a user's page once. 23:50, 16 May 2010 (UTC)

Currently, the default image size for thumbnails in articles is 180px, which is quite small and often difficult to see. While this can be adjusted with user preferences, the English Wikipedia recently changed their default image size to 250 pixels, which makes images much more useful. Given the lack of any major problems (to my knowledge) since the change, I'd like to propose that Simple follow suit. Any comments? – |  01:18, 10 May 2010 (UTC)

Should there be a vote? {{||}} 04:27, 12 May 2010 (UTC)

– |  17:37, 12 May 2010 (UTC)

I think 200px is fine. -- 00:09, 13 May 2010 (UTC)





Even though I would have preferred 250px, after over a week of discussion, consensus seems to be in favor of a compromise (225px). As such, I'll file a bugzilla barring any objections in the next few hours. – |  20:57, 18 May 2010 (UTC)

It will not be long before Vector comes to Simple English Wikipedia. I find Vector to be very cumbersome to use (finding tabs), too much work to fix (gadgets), and hard to edit with. If it is possible for Monobook to be kept as default, would the community be willing to keep Monobook? Wikinews put their default as Vector several months ago, so I assume requests are considered. On a side note, Hebrew Wikipedia has already conducted a straw poll, and a majority of their users have agreed to keep Monobook (although nothing has yet happened). Being unique is good, as it makes us memorable (how I remembered WN). () 11:52, 13 May 2010 (UTC)


I would also prefer monobook to be kept as default. () 12:23, 14 May 2010 (UTC)

Personally I haven't made up my mind, I like Monobook but have been working on trying to use vector as much as possible. Is it perfect? No of course it isn't but having seen a lot of the studies that they did and having talked to a lot of the staff members that did them I think there is quite a lot of evidence to show that vector has proven to be easier to understand for new users and readers. The new features that are being rolled out at the same time (and the ones planned) also make it easier to contribute and many of them do not work on monobook (one of the main reasons to design vector was to build it to allow these and other features). I think it would be a large mistake to stop the rollout here, in the end we would be trading our own temporary comfort for something designed specifically to make it easier for the new readers and editors that we need. People always hate change when we are comfortable with what we had and we will easily be able to move back to monobook individually after the rollout. " ( )" 18:15, 14 May 2010 (UTC)

Let's try to form consensus as the Hebrew Wikipedia did :) -- 18:44, 14 May 2010 (UTC)
 Monobook looks more 3D, and much nicer. Maybe this is just me but the new logo doesn't even look round. /// 11:18, 17 May 2010 (UTC)



<-- They have halted the rollout of the new logo because of the communities concerns, we shuldn't design a new one until we know what it will look like ;) " ( )" 16:58, 15 May 2010 (UTC)

Hello all, 

I just had a look at the current "page requrests". Those listed are almost exclusively bible/christianity related, and have been sitting there for quite some time. Shouldn't we vary the subjects a little more? -- () 13:57, 16 May 2010 (UTC)

The dispute resolution appears very shoddy here right now. Is it possible we could set up a sort of Arbitration Committee for major disputes, or a Mediation commitee? 10:12, 17 May 2010 (UTC)

I am going to take a wild guess that is the same as the Sockpuppet investigations at the English Wikipedia. I am just wondering if you get that many requests done here because I am pretty active there at the other site. 15:15, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

I propose that the the discussion be re-opened here as this is a much more high traffic page. The discussion last time was closed prematurely (IMO) as the only two users that opposed were directly affected by it (a bias). Of the last 500 imports (quick scan, might be wrong), none of them were done by the two importers. Comments? () 22:53, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

Can I suggest that we either delete or drastically change it to direct people to "Wikipedia:Simple talk"? 02:23, 20 May 2010 (UTC)

Friends,

Per the above suggestion, I've cleaned up the talk page at . Please take a look, and let us see if we can't work on this. Thank you for your time, @:~$ 08:40, 22 May 2010 (UTC)

 states that administrators need to provide an email address. This would seem to exclude some users who would make capable administrators but cannot become an administrator because either they do not have an email address or do not want to give it out. Therefore, I feel we should drop this requirement. () 15:35, 21 May 2010 (UTC)
<-Yes, what James said. All admins should have a private way of contacting them, and IMO all users should. () 21:43, 21 May 2010 (UTC)

When the template is used to display geographical coordinates with the parameter display=title, the coordinates are displayed at the level the article text starts. This overlays the output from infobox templates. See Hockenheimring and compare to . It look find during edit preview because coordinates line up with the Preview statement. This happens in Opera, Chrome, and IE8. -- () 04:01, 26 May 2010 (UTC)

Hi all. City of Manchester Stadium is currently up for proposal as a very good article at . It has been there since May 11 and has only received comments from one user (thanks, Meganmccarty!). Could some others take a look at the article? Right now it's missing 13 redlinks, which I hope to have finished by week's end, but otherwise, I think it is in very good condition as it is based on an English Wikipedia Featured Article. Any input would be appreciated. I just don't want to see the effort go to waste because of a lack of comments! Thanks! () 10:24, 25 May 2010 (UTC)

All the redlinks are done. The article is now awaiting further reviews. If you could comment at the talk page or at , please do. Thanks! () 22:19, 28 May 2010 (UTC)

Have we totally given up on basic English grammar? When I see there are 173 references to "trade unions" I feel a mixture of fury and despair. Here goes: in English, nouns take plural forms, but adjectives do not. So we say "White swans". The same applies for those cases where the noun comes first and the adjectives after, such as "trades union" because trade is a noun and union an adjective. If "union" is used on its own as a substitute for the full term, then it is being used as a noun, and so takes a plural. Then "unions" is correct. Perhaps I should add that in "labor union", the U.S. version, "labor" does not take a plural because it is a collective noun. "En passant", I notice the page Noun mistakes "plural" for "collective". Collective nouns may only be used for groups.

I suspect that were we to have a purge on grammar (say a couple of weeks) we would find hundreds (thousands?) of cases of clearly mistaken grammar.

Hi. I just added some footnotes at . As you see at the "notes" section, six of them are identical. I want to name them just like naming references so that I won't have the exact text for 6 ones. Thanks. () 23:36, 28 May 2010 (UTC)

Hi, 
I would like to draw everyone's attention to this event, offering a backstage tour of the British Museum for Wikipedians. I have to the organiser of the event, Liam Wyatt aka Witty Lama, who has agreed that the Simple English Wikipedia contribution to the collaboration could be an important part. He has suggested that, in return for a drive in all British Museum related articles (ie its exhibits, of which there are thousands of important archaelogical relics), he may talk about SEWP at the event, and generally promote our project. Hopefully this will entice users from other Wikis to come over here and help us out with this and all our other projects!

I know it might not be a lot, but considering the user base here, we could really do with some more user and I think this might help out. What do you guys think, is this a good idea? And more importantly would you be willing to help out? 23:37, 29 May 2010 (UTC)

Well I guess this would give a general idea of the most important articles... 
The event is this coming Friday so I can talk to the organisers about it in more detail then, and set up a project page or something. 16:37, 31 May 2010 (UTC)

I have posted my suggestion to make the Main Page shorter in : Is Main Page too long?. I think it is appropriate and should be considered. -- () 04:25, 30 May 2010 (UTC)

Hi all...City of Manchester Stadium has been sitting at without comment for a week now. Could I get some people to review it or "vote" on it so we can hopefully bring this to a conclusion soon? It's been up for almost a month with little attention at times. I would definitely like to see this pass soon. Thanks! () 12:40, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

Some of the articles need to use technical vocabulary. The result is that there is a frequent need to avoid these words somehow. I have found software called EHTip that provides "fly-over" dictionary support. It would require a fair amount of work to convert an existing dictionary file. (I've started with a German-English x English-German set.) However, the number of marginal vocabulary items may not be too great. I suspect that physics and other technical subjects may require the most help.

Is there some way that interested people could cooperate in rewriting the English-German file and make it an English-Simple English file? English Wikipedia has "projects," but I have not noticed any of them on this site. () 03:00, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

Please discuss in light of this incorrect use of global rollback by /. I agree it was not a good edit by the anon, but it was also not vandalism and should have been undone as a edit rather than a rather rude use of rollback (which is only for definite vandalism). Thanks! 07:49, 9 June 2010 (UTC)
<-Global vandalism-fighters are often more heavy-handed when fighting vandalism. That's a culture which has to be accepted if you want their protection. They have to revert all the external link additions by one user, and that is very time-consuming to do using undo (especially if they do not understand English). #cvn-sw shows the RC of over 400 wikis which, needless to say, is a lot of changes. There is no logical conclusion to this thread, so let's just leave it at that. () 12:35, 9 June 2010 (UTC)

It has come to my attention that there are certain features of Wikipedia, specifically the "watch" option/tab at the top of each page, that I would like for Wikimedia to turn off. See for further details. () 00:10, 11 June 2010 (UTC)

I like it... but can anyone confirm that it does break functionality on things like the user talk auto warn thing? Thanks, @:~$ 21:16, 11 June 2010 (UTC)

We're doing a terrible on the article. We didn't even have the standings update until I did it a few minutes ago, and France-Uruguay ended hours ago. We need a few people to volunteer to CLEAN UP the article and KEEP IT UPDATED, cuz honestly it's hash right now. 01:04, 12 June 2010 (UTC)

Brownfield land

Brownfield sites are abandoned or underused industrial and business places available for re-use. Expansion or redevelopment of such a facility may be difficult by real or possible environmental contaminations. 

In the United States city planning language, a brownfield site (or simply a brownfield) is land previously used for industrial purposes or certain business uses. The land may be contaminated by low amounts of hazardous waste or pollution. It has the potential to be reused once it is cleaned up. Land that is more severely contaminated and has high levels of hazardous waste or pollution, such as a Superfund site, does not fall under the brownfield classification. "Mothballed brownfields" are properties which the owners are not willing to transfer or put to productive reuse.

In the United Kingdom and Australia, the term applies more generally to previously used land.

Manchester Velodrome

Manchester Velodrome is an indoor cycle-racing track (or velodrome) in Manchester, in the north west of England. It opened in September 1994 and is the United Kingdom's leading indoor Olympic-standard track. Today it is home to the National Cycling Centre, and the headquarters of British Cycling, the national governing body. It is open to the public. 

It hosted the track cycling in the 2002 Commonwealth Games, and the UCI world championships in 1996, 2000 and 2008.

The track has a reputation for speed. By 30 March 2008, more than 15 world records had been set there. The records include Chris Boardman's 1996 and 2000 hour records and the 4000 metre team pursuit record set by the Great Britain men's team at the 2008 World Championships.

The track is 250 metres long. Its bankings reach 42 degrees in the middle. The track is as steep at the top as it is on the black (racing) line. On 21 May 2007 the velodrome closed to be re-surfaced. The old track was relaid with Siberian pine. It reopened on 16 July 2007, and is now considered smoother to ride.

The Revolution Series was introduced in 2003 to make track cycling more popular. Its goal was to try and build on the success of the well attended events like the World Championships and World Cup Classics Meetings. It was also to provide more regular events for fans to go to. The series started with 4 events over the winter season and quickly built up good regular crowds. The first close to sell out crowd came at the 7th meeting, in 2005, when all seats were sold with a further number of fans standing. The first official complete sell out came at Revolution 14 and is now a regular occurrence.

Alongside the senior racing, the Future Stars competition also runs at each Revolution event. This series involves young riders, usually 15-16 year olds, and puts them through a number of races each night to test both their sprint and endurance skills. 

An incomplete list of events which Manchester Velodrome has hosted:


The velodrome is not just solely for the use of professional riders. Cycling fans can also have the opportunity of riding around the famous boards as well. Regular sessions are run every week at the velodrome, starting from taster sessions right up to serious training. A taster session involves some basic training and an hour riding the track. 

On 2 July 2009 cycling fans Kraftwerk performed at the Manchester Velodrome as part of the 2009 Manchester International Festival. During the performance of the song Tour de France, four members of the British Olympic Cycling Team entered the velodrome and cycled circuits.

United States presidential election, 2012

The 2012 United States presidental election will be on November 6, 2012. There will also be elections for the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives. There will be several changes between the 2008 election and the 2012 election. For one thing, the Republican Party has switched around the order of the state primary elections. Also, the Electoral College will be changed because of the 2010 Census. Several states will lose votes, and several states will gain votes.

As a result of the 2010 Census, several states will gain electoral votes and several states will lose electoral votes. Here are the states that will gain or lose:

Gaining Votes

Losing Votes

The Republicans will hold their national convention the week of August 27 at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa. The Democrats will hold their convention the week of September 3 in Charlotte, North Carolina..

Barack Obama can run for President again, and almost certainly will. While other Democrats can run against Obama in the primary elections (which decide whom the party nominates for president), it is unlikely that the Democrats will not nominate him, though many Democrats think someone should still run against him in the primary. The last time that a president running for a second term was not nominated again was in 1968, when Lyndon B. Johnson decided to stop running for a second term after he realized that he was going to lose. On April 4, 2011, Obama said he was going to run for a second term.

As of December 2011, several people from the Republican Party have said they are running for President. These include:


There have been questions of whether other people, such as Sarah Palin, will run for President. People such as Scott Brown, Mike Huckabee and Donald Trump have said they are "not" running. In May, a series of debates began between the Republicans.

In August 2011, the Ames Straw Poll was conducted. It was won by Bachmann, with Paul coming in second. During the poll, Perry entered the race. After the poll, former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty dropped out.

In December 2011, Cain left the Presidential race. This was after several women accused him of sexual harassment.

The Republican primaries begin in early 2012 with the states of Iowa and New Hampshire

Though the election is more than two years away, several polls have been taken about it. Most polls show Obama beating most Republicans, often by ten or more points. Recently, a few polls have shown Huckabee or Romney running fairly even with Obama. In polls taken state-by-state, Obama usually wins states he won in 2008, and Republicans usually win states that McCain won in 2008.

The Kippax

The Kippax was one of the most well known stands at Manchester City's Maine Road Ground. Originally the Popular Stand, its name was changed in 1957. The Kippax was unusual in that unlike in most other grounds, this area of support occupied a full side rather than an end of the ground. In 1994, due to the Taylor Report, the new redeveloped, all seater stand was opened by City legend Bert Trautmann. It housed 10,000 fans and had three levels. At the time it was the highest stand in the country.

The club left the Maine Road ground in 2003 and moved to the new City of Manchester Stadium.. This of course bought the end for one of City's most loved stands, The Kippax. Unofficially, the East stand in the new stadium is also named Kippax.

UEFA Women's Euro 2005

The 2005 UEFA Women's Championship, also called WOMEN'S EURO 2005 (trademark of UEFA), was a football tournament for women held from 5 June to 19 June 2005 in Lancashire, England. The UEFA Women's Championship is a regular tournament involving European national teams from countries that are part of UEFA, the European governing body, who have qualified for the competition. The competition tries to determine which national women's team is the best in Europe.

Germany won the competition for the fourth consecutive tournament. It was the sixth time overall (including one win in the predecessor tournament, the "European Competition for Representative Women's Teams") that they won. Their championship win was the last for coach Tina Theune-Meyer, who months earlier had announced that she would retire at the end of the tournament. In her nine years in charge of Germany, they won three European titles, two bronze medals in the Olympics, and the 2003 World Cup.

Eight national teams participated—seven which qualified from earlier stages, plus England, which received an automatic berth as the host nation. They were split into two groups of 4: Group A and Group B. Each team in a group played each other once, with the top two teams in each group moving into the semi-finals. The winner faced the runner-up of the other group in a play-off, with the winner of each semi-final advancing to the final to determine the champion.



A qualifying round ran from 22 March to 3 October 2004 . The teams which were entered played in a group stage, with the winners advancing to the final, and the runners-up being given the chance of qualification through a play-off. England, as the host nation, qualified automatically for the tournament.

The following teams were eliminated at this stage :


Three teams were also eliminated in play-offs for the tournament:

Public health

Public health is the science dealing with prevention of a disease that is a threat to the overall health of a community, as well as with prolonging life and promoting health. The aims are achieved through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, public and private organizations, communities and individuals. 

It bases on health analysis of a handful of people or all the inhabitants of several continents rather than on an individual. Public health includes such parts as epidemiology, biostatistics, health services, environmental, social, behavioral, and occupational health. 

Public health intervention prevents rather than treats a disease through surveillance of cases and promotes healthy behaviors such as hand washing, vaccination programs and distribution of condoms. In outbreaks of an infectious disease, treating a disease may be vital to preventing it in others. 

Most countries have their own government public health agencies, sometimes known as ministries of health, to respond to domestic health issues. Many diseases are preventable through simple, non-medical methods. Public health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in the developing world and in developed countries, through local health systems and through international non-governmental organizations. In the developing world, there may not be enough trained health workers or monetary resources to provide a basic level of medical care and disease prevention. 

Public health has roots in antiquity. From the beginning, human civilization recognized that polluted water and lack of proper waste disposal spread communicable diseases. Early religions attempted to regulate behavior related to health, from types of food eaten, to behaviors, such as drinking alcohol or sexual relations. Governments placed responsibility on leaders to develop public health policies and programs in order to gain some understanding of the causes of disease, ensure social stability prosperity, and maintain order. 

The Chinese developed the practice of variolation following a smallpox epidemic around 1000 BC. The practice of vaccination did not become prevalent until the 1820s. During the 14th century Black Death in Europe, burning parts of cities resulted in benefit, since it destroyed the rodent infestations. The development of quarantine in the medieval period restricted effects of other infectious diseases. 

Later they started build of sewers, the regular collection of garbage, incineration or disposal, providing clean water and draining standing water to prevent the breeding of mosquitos. The industrial revolution initially caused the spread of disease through large conurbations around workhouses and factories. 

The increase in average life span in the 20th century is credited to public health achievements, such as vaccination programs and control of infectious diseases, effective safety policies of motor-vehicle and occupational safety, improved family planning, chlorination of drinking water, smoke-free measures, and programs on decreasing chronic disease such as cancer, heart disease and more physical exercise.

Sometimes, the developing world is plagued by largely preventable infectious diseases, due to malnutrition and poverty. The focus of public health has moved from individual behaviors and risk factors to population-level issues such as inequality, poverty, and education. There is recognition that our health is affected by where we live, genetics, our income, our educational status and our social relationships. 

Schools of public health offer: 

Most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, and the effects of aging, although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine. In recent years, public health programs providing vaccinations have made strides in promoting health, including the eradication of smallpox. 

An important public health issues facing the world currently are HIV/AIDS, antibiotic resistance, leading to the re-emergence of diseases such as Tuberculosis, diabetes. As non-communicable diseases caused by smoking have been threatening public health, public health started controlling smoking. The global health system needs to find a way to even out communicable and non communicable diseases. Many nations have implemented major initiatives to cut smoking, such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places.

Epidemiology

Epidemiology is the study of factors which affect the health and illness of populations by communicable and non-communicable diseases. The study is the foundation and logic of interventions made in the interest of public health and preventive medicine. It also is an important methodology of public health research, and an evidence-based medicine for identifying risk factors for disease and determining optimal treatment approaches to clinical practice. 

Epidemiologists work from outbreak investigation to study design, data collection and analysis including the development of statistical models to test hypotheses and the documentation of results. Epidemiologists also study the interaction of diseases in a population. Epidemiologists rely on biology (to better understand disease processes), biostatistics (the current raw information available), Geographic Information Science (to store data and map disease patterns) and social science disciplines (to better understand proximate and distal risk factors).

Epidemiology means "the study of what is upon the people". The word derived from the Greek terms "epi" = upon, among; "demos" = people, district; "logos" = study, word, discourse. It applies only to human populations. But the term is used in studies of zoological populations, although there is the term 'epizoology', and it has also been applied to studies of plant populations.

Hippocrates is viewed as the father of epidemiology as the first who has examined the relationships between the occurrence of disease and environmental influences. He has also drawn the distinction between 'epidemic' and 'endemic' to distinguish between diseases that are 'visited upon' a population (epidemic) from those that 'reside within' a population (endemic). The Persian physician Avicenna considered a "father of modern medicine.” In 1020s, he discovered the contagious nature of tuberculosis and sexually transmitted disease, and the distribution of disease through water and soil. Avicenna stated that bodily secretion is contaminated by foul foreign earthly bodies before being infected. He introduced the method of quarantine as a means of limiting the spread of contagious disease. 

When the Black Death (bubonic plague) reached Al Andalus in the 14th century, Ibn Khatima hypothesized that infectious diseases are caused by "minute bodies" which enter the human body and cause disease. Another Andalusian-Arabian physician, Ibn al-Khatib (1313–1374) in his treatise "On the Plague" stated how infectious disease can be transmitted through bodily contact and "through garments, vessels and earrings. Italian doctor from Verona named Girolamo Fracastoro was the first to propose a theory that these very small, unseeable, particles that cause disease were alive. They were considered to be able to spread by air, multiply by themselves and to be destroyable by fire. He refuted Galen's miasma theory (poison gas in sick people). In 1543, he in his book "De contagione et contagiosis morbis" was the first to promote personal and environmental hygiene to prevent disease. The development of a sufficiently powerful microscope by Anton van Leeuwenhoek in 1675 provided visual evidence of living particles consistent with a germ theory of disease.

In 1662 John Graunt used analysis of the mortality rolls in London before the Great Plague to provide statistical evidence for many theories on disease, and refute widespread ideas on them. Dr. John Snow investigated into the causes of the 19th Century Cholera epidemics. He noticed the significantly higher death rates in two areas supplied by Southwark Company. His identification of the Broad Street pump as the cause of the Soho epidemic is the classic example of epidemiology. He used chlorine in an attempt to clean the water and had the handle removed, thus ending the outbreak. This has been perceived as a major event in the history of public health and can be regarded as the founding event of the science of epidemiology.

The term 'epidemiology' has first been used to describe the study of epidemics in 1802 by the Spanish physician Villalba. The term has expanded considerably in scope since to cover the description and causation of not only epidemic disease, but of disease in general, and even many non-disease health-related conditions, such as high blood pressure and obesity.

In 1847 Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis brought down infant mortality at a Vienna hospital by instituting a disinfection procedure. Unfortunately, disinfection did not become widely practiced until British surgeon Joseph Lister 'discovered' antiseptics in 1865 in light of the work of Louis Pasteur. In the early 20th century, mathematical methods were introduced into epidemiology by Ronald Ross and others. In 1954 there was a publication of the results of a British Doctors Study, led by Richard Doll, which lent very strong statistical support to the suspicion that tobacco smoking was linked to lung cancer.

Many epidemiologists are physicians, or hold graduate degrees of Master of Public Health (MPH), Master of Science or Epidemiology (MSc.). Doctorates include the Doctor of Public Health (DrPH), Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Doctor of Science (ScD), or for clinically trained physicians, Doctor of Medicine (MD) and Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) . As public health/health protection practitioners, epidemiologists work in a number of different settings. Some epidemiologists work in the community, commonly in a public health/health protection service and are at the forefront of investigating and combating disease outbreaks. Others work for non-profit organizations, universities, hospitals and larger government entities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Health Protection Agency, The World Health Organisation (WHO).

Epidemiology isn’t a collection of statistical tools used to elucidate the associations of exposures to health outcomes, but discovers "causal" relationships. Epidemiologists employ a range of study designs from the observational to experimental and generally categorized as descriptive, analytic (aiming to further examine known associations or hypothesized relationships), and experimental (a term often equated with clinical or community trials of treatments and other interventions). Epidemiological studies are aimed, where possible, at revealing unbiased relationships between exposures such as alcohol or smoking, biological agents, stress, or chemicals to mortality or morbidity. The identification of causal relationships between these exposures and outcomes is an important aspect of epidemiology. Epidemiologists use informatics as a tool. The term "epidemiologic triad" means the intersection of "Host", "Agent", and "Environment" in analyzing an outbreak. Epidemiologists use the key term inference and gather data, a broad range of biomedical and psychosocial theories biology, sociology, mathematics, statistics, anthropology, psychology, and policy in an iterative way to generate or expand theory, to test hypotheses, and to make educated, informed assertions about which relationships are causal, and about exactly how they are causal. Since 1965 they use Bradford-Hill criteria for assessing evidence of causation.

Epidemiological studies can only go to prove that an agent could have caused disease in population, but not that it did cause, an effect in any particular case. Epidemiology has its limits at the point where an inference is made that the relationship between an agent and a disease is causal (general causation) and where the magnitude of excess risk attributed to the agent has been determined; that is, epidemiology addresses whether an agent can cause a disease, not whether an agent did cause a specific plaintiff’s disease. As a public health discipline, epidemiologic evidence is often used to advocate both personal measures like diet change and corporate measures like removal of junk food advertising, with study findings disseminated to the general public in order to help people to make informed decisions about their health. Often the uncertainties about these findings are not communicated well; news articles often prominently report the latest result of one study with little mention of its limitations, or context. Epidemiological tools have proved effective in establishing major causes of diseases like cholera and lung cancer but have had problems with more subtle health issues, and several recent epidemiological results on medical treatments (for example, on the effects of hormone replacement therapy) have been refuted by later randomized controlled trials. 

Epidemiological practice and the results of epidemiological analysis make a significant contribution to emerging population-based health management frameworks:

Modern population-based health management is complex, requiring a multiple set of skills (medical, political, technological, mathematical etc.) of which epidemiological practice and analysis is a core component, that is unified with management science to provide efficient and effective health care and health guidance to a population. This task requires the forward looking ability of modern risk management approaches that transform health risk factors, incidence, prevalence and mortality statistics (derived from epidemiological analysis) into management metrics that not only guide how a health system responds to current population health issues, but also how a health system can be managed to better respond to future potential population health issues.

Case-series may refer to the qualititative study of the experience of a single patient, or small group of patients with a similar diagnosis, or to a statistical technique comparing periods during which patients are exposed to some factor with the potential to produce illness with periods when they are unexposed.

Cohort studies select subjects based on their exposure status. The study subjects should be at risk of the outcome under investigation at the beginning of the cohort study; this usually means that they should be disease free when the cohort study starts. The cohort is followed through time to assess their later outcome status.

Pooper-scooper

A pooper-scooper, or poop scoop, is a device or a ‘poop bag’ used by pet owners to pick up an animal's fecal matter from public places and yards. Such devices often have a bag or bag attachment. The ‘poop bag’ is usually turned inside out, to carry the feces to a proper disposal area. The person performing the cleanup might also be called as a pooper-scooper.

A number of places, including New York City, have laws telling pet owners to clean up after their pets after the pet has pooped on a sidewalk or any public place, on a floor, wall, stairway or roof of any public or private premises used in common by the public, or on a fence, wall or stairway of a building abutting on a public. Authorized employees of New York City Departments of Health (including Animal Care & Control), of Sanitation, or of Parks and Recreation can issue tickets. 

Pet droppings contaminate the environment with bacteria, parasites and stench. The droppings are one of the leading sources of "E. coli" (fecal coliforms) bacterial pollution: one gram of dog feces contains over 20,000,000 "E. coli" cells. Coliform bacteria and "E. coli" are commonly-used field indicators of fecal contamination by animals (including human). While an individual animal's deposit of feces will not measurably affect the environment, the cumulative effect of thousands of dogs and cats in a metropolitan area creates serious problems due to contamination of soil and water supplies. The runoff from neglected pet waste contaminates water, creates health hazards for people, fish, ducks, etc.

The situation is particularly dire in Germany, where an estimated 1400 tonnes of feces are deposited daily on public property. A citizen commission (2005) overwhelmingly recommended a plan. DNA samples would be required when pet licenses come up for renewal. Within a year, a database of some 12,500 registration-required canine residents would be available to sanitation workers with sample-test kits. Evidence would be submitted to a forensics laboratory where technicians could readily match the waste to its dog. The prospect of a prompt fine equivalent to $600 US (at 2005 exchange rate) would help assure preventive compliance, as well as cover costs.

Metastability

The concept of metastability has slightly different meanings in different fields of knowledge. However, there is a core meaning that captures most of the commonality among its uses in different fields. The general idea is that something is metastable if it is not changing, yet given a small perturbation ("nudge") it will transition to another, more stable state. For example, a block is sitting on a slope (an "inclined plane"). It keeps sitting there until it is nudged, or the slope is gently struck, setting up vibrations. Then the block starts to slide. At that point it keeps sliding until it reaches the bottom. The block sitting at the bottom is stable. The block sitting on the slope but not moving is metastable. And the block as it is moving is unstable. A real life example of this is an avalanche of snow. The avalanche is unstable (the snow is sliding down the mountainside). When the avalanche is over the snow is stable. Before the avalanche starts, the snow is metastable, since some small perturbation is enough to cause it to lose what might have seemed to be stability, but in fact was only metastability.

The Planck constant, sometimes called Planck's constant, is an important number in quantum physics. It is named after the physicist Max Planck. It was first used as a way to link the amount of energy a photon carries with the frequency of its electromagnetic wave. 
This idea can be written in an equation like this
formula_1
where E stands for energy, H is the Planck constant and F is the frequency. 

The Planck constant can roughly be measured as 6.63x10. Using this number scientists have calculated measurements like the Planck length, and the Planck time.

Sebastian Newbold Coe, Baron Coe, KBE (born 29 September 1956, and often nicknamed "Seb Coe") is a former athlete and politician from the United Kingdom. A middle distance runner, Coe won the 1500 m gold medal at the Olympic Games in 1980 and 1984, and set eight outdoor and three indoor world records. He is widely considered to be amongst the greatest middle distance runners of all time. Following his retirement from athletics, he served as a Member of Parliament for the Conservative Party from 1992-97. He became a life peer in 2000. He is the head of the London bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. After the International Olympic Committee awarded the games to London, he became the chairman of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. In 2007, he was also elected a vice-president of the International Association of Athletics Federations.

Coe was born in Chiswick, London. His mother, Tina Angela Coe, died in Hammersmith and Fulham, London, in 2005, aged 75. His mother was half Indian, born to a Punjabi father Sardari Lal and an English mother Vera. His father, Peter Coe (born Percy N. Coe in Kingston-upon-Thames), died on 9 August 2008, aged 88, while Coe was in Beijing.

Coe married Nicky McIrvine, a former Badminton three-day-event champion, in Surrey, in 1990. They have two sons and two daughters, all of whom were born in Surrey:


The marriage ended in divorce in 2002 after twelve years and Coe moved out of the family home. Coe married Carole Annett in summer 2011.

On 12 February 2010, Coe was the 19th runner on the 106th day of the Vancouver Olympic Torch Relay. Coe's leg was along the Stanley Park Seawall, and he exchanged a "torch kiss" with the previous runner, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the next runner, a 19 year old member of the Squamish community.

He was awarded with the first Prince of Asturias Award in sports category in 1987.

Coe was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1982 and an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1990. He was created a life peer in 2000 as Baron Coe, of Ranmore in the County of Surrey.

In December 2005, Coe was given a Special award at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards ceremony. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2006 New Year's Honours List for services to sport.

Theme restaurant

Theme restaurants are restaurants in which the idea for the restaurant takes priority over everything else. It influences the architecture, food, music, and overall "feel" of the restaurant. The food usually takes a backseat to the presentation of the theme. These restaurants generally attract customers only because of the theme itself.

One example is the "Rainforest Cafe" restaurants which have the obvious theme of a "Tropical Rainforest". "Medieval Times" has its theme of "Medieval Europe". The "Jekyll & Hyde Club" has an atmosphere of Jack the Ripper and Victorian horror novels. One strange but famous theme restaurant in Berlin, Germany is called "das Klo" (German for "The toilet"). It shows the insides of a toilet.

Many people consider the Rainforest Cafe to be biggest example of a theme restaurant. They also consider it the restaurant which kicked off the theme restaurant trend. Theme restaurants may be experiencing a decline in popularity, given the closings of several Planet Hollywood, Jekyll & Hyde Club, and Wilderness Cafe locations in recent years. Theme restaurants often depend on tourist business, since the theme soon becomes stale to locals. The focus is not necessarily placed on good food and service. Certain tourist destinations such as the Mall of America or Orlando, Florida have better chances of supporting theme restaurants. Theme restaurants are generally common at theme parks, such as Universal Studios.

<doc id="245994" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=245994" title="John Laing plc">
John Laing plc

John Laing plc is a British developer and operator of privately financed, public sector infrastructure projects such as roads, railways, hospitals and schools. Before being bought by Henderson Private Equity in December 2006, John Laing plc was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was part of the FTSE 250 Index.

The business started in 1848. James Laing (born in 1816), along with his wife Ann Graham, and some employees whom they had hired, built a house on a plot of land that they had bought for £30 in Cumberland. The £150 proceeds from the first house financed the building of the next two houses on the same plot of land. One of these houses was kept by the Laing Family to live in. The family and the business later moved near Carlisle. 

When James Laing died in 1882, his son, John Laing (born in 1842) took over the running of the company. John began to take larger contracts but kept the business in the Carlisle area.

John's son, John William Laing, (born in 1879) was working for the business before he was 20 years old, and so it became John Laing and Son. By 1910, John William Laing was running the business. More employees were recruited and larger projects were undertaken, including factory construction. 

In 1920 the firm became a limited company, and two years later moved its headquarters from Carlisle to a thirteen acre (5 ha) site at Mill Hill in north-west London. 

William Kirby Laing and John Maurice Laing, the fifth generation of the founding family, joined the company in 1950.

John Laing & Sons (Holdings) Ltd was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1952. The family and its trusts and charities held the majority of the shares. John William Laing became the chairman, and his sons became joint managing directors. By this time, the number of employees was around 10,000, and every site had a quality supervisor. John William Laing retired in 1957.

Under William Kirby Laing and James Maurice Laing, the company continued to expand. They gained contracts for power stations. They also worked on road construction while continuing to build houses. In 1985, Martin Laing, of the sixth generation of the founding family, became chairman.

Martin Laing determined that the company should begin to diversify. Home construction in the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Spain, and California was now one of the major sources of the company's growth.

As the company celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1998, it faced falling profits caused by cost overruns on the Millennium project and continuing problems within its construction division, related to competition and overcapacity.

In 1999 John Laing plc purchased a controlling interest in the Chiltern Rail franchise and by 2002 had structured itself into two main divisions, namely Homes and Investments. It underwent yet another change when Sir Martin Laing retired in early 2002. Bill Forrester took over as executive chairman. For the first time in its history Laing did not have a member of the founding family at the head of the company.

The business expanded rapidly in the late 1990s, such that for the year ended 31 December 2001 its turnover was in excess of £1 billion. Following significant losses on certain construction contracts it adopted a new policy of having the PPP / PFI businesses, in which it had been quite successful, as core activities. As a consequence it disposed of its construction division, which was sold to O'Rourke in 2001, its property developments divisions, which were sold to Kier Group, and its house building arm which was sold to George Wimpey in 2002. 

In December 2006 John Laing plc was acquired by the Private Equity arm of Henderson Group.

The Laing Rail division - operators of Chiltern Railways and London Overground (with MTR Corporation), and holders of a stake in the open-access railway operator Wrexham & Shropshire - was put up for sale by in September 2007. The division was purchased by German rail operator Deutsche Bahn in January 2008, subject to approval by authorities.

In June 2008 John Laing formed a consortium with Hitachi and Barclays Private Equity called Agility Trains to bid for the contract to design, manufacture, and maintain a fleet of long-distance trains for the Intercity Express Programme. The bid was successful and the contract was awarded to the consortium on the 12 February 2009.

John Laing now has operations in the UK, North America, Europe and Asia.

John Laing’s former construction division, Laing Construction, undertook a number of landmark projects including:

The M1 motorway completed in 1959, Coventry Cathedral completed in 1962, Clifton Cathedral completed in 1973, the Sizewell B nuclear power station completed in 1995, the Second Severn Crossing completed in 1996, the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff completed in 1999 and Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital completed in 2001.
The subsidiary Laing Rail owned and operated Chiltern Railways and was joint operator of London Overground (with MTR Corporation) and Wrexham & Shropshire (with Renaissance Trains). In 2008 Laing Rail was sold to Deutsche Bahn.

Norman Foster (architect)

Norman Robert Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank, OM, FRIBA, FCSD, RDI (born 1 June 1935) is a British architect. His company has an international design practice. He is Britain's biggest builder of landmark office buildings. In 2009 Foster was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award in the Arts category. 

Foster was born in Reddish, Stockport, England, to a working-class family. He did well at school and became interested in architecture. Foster was particularly interested in the works of Frank Lloyd Wright, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Le Corbusier.

He left school at 16 and worked in the Manchester City Treasurer's office. Next he joined the National Service in the Royal Air Force. After he was discharged, in 1956 Foster attended the University of Manchester's School of Architecture and City Planning. He graduated in 1961. Later, Foster won the Henry Fellowship to the Yale School of Architecture, where he earned his Master's degree Foster also met Richard Rogers at Yale. He then travelled in America for a year. He returned to the UK in 1963. Then he set up an architectural practice as Team 4 with Rogers and the sisters Georgie and Wendy Cheesman. Georgie (later Wolton) was the only one of the team that had passed her RIBA exams. This allowed them to set up in practice on their own. Team 4 quickly earned a reputation for high-tech industrial design.

After Team 4 broke up, in 1967 Foster and Wendy Cheesman started Foster Associates. This later became Foster and Partners. From 1968, Foster worked with American architect Richard Buckminster Fuller until Fuller died in 1983. They worked on several projects that became important in the development of an environmentally sensitive approach to design. This included the Samuel Beckett Theatre project.
Foster + Partners' first important building in the UK was the Willis Faber & Dumas headquarters in Ipswich, from 1974. The client was a family firm insurance company which wanted to restore a sense of community to the workplace. Foster created open-plan office floors long before open-plan became the standard. In a town that did not have a lot of public facilities, the roof gardens, 25m swimming pool and gymnasium are good benefits for the company's 1,200 employees. The building is wrapped in a full-height glass facade. This wall follows the medieval street plan. The facade shifts from opaque, reflective black to a glowing backlit transparency as the sun sets.

Today, Foster + Partners works with its engineers to use computer systems. They pay attention to basic physical laws such as convection. They have created efficient buildings like the Swiss Re London headquarters. The walls let in air for passive cooling and then let it out as it warms and rises.

In January 2007, "The Sunday Times" reported that Foster had called in Catalyst, a corporate finance house, to find buyers for Foster + Partners. Foster does not want to retire, but wants to sell his 80-90% holding in the company valued at £300M to £500M.

Foster is a member of the Board of Trustees for the architectural charity Article 25. They design, construct and manage safe, sustainable buildings in dangerous parts of the world. He has also been on the Board of Trustees of The Architecture Foundation.

Foster was knighted in 1990 and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1997. In 1999, he was created a life peer, as Baron Foster of Thames Bank, of Reddish in the County of Greater Manchester. He is a Crossbencher.

He is the second British architect to win the Stirling Prize twice: the first for the American Air Museum at the Imperial War Museum Duxford in 1998, and the second for 30 St Mary Axe in 2004. Foster was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1999. He is also a Fellow of the Chartered Society of Designers and winner of the Minerva Medal, the Society's highest award. In Germany Lord Foster received the Order Pour le Mérite.

Most recently, in September 2007, Foster was awarded the Aga Khan Award for Architecture, the largest architectural award in the world, for the University of Technology Petronas, in Malaysia.

It was announced in January 2008 that Foster was to be awarded an honorary degree from the Dundee School of Architecture at the University of Dundee. In 2009 Foster was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award in the category "Arts".

Foster married business partner Wendy Cheesman. She died in 1989, leaving him with four sons. He next married Indian-born Begum Sabiha Rumani Malik. Sabiha was married to Andrew Knight when she and Foster met. Knight was Chairman of News International. Foster and Sabiha divorced in 1998. Foster is now married to Elena Ochoa, Chairman of the Tate International Council, and founder of Ivory Press. He has five children and three grandchildren.

Foster flies his own private jet and helicopter between his homes in London, France, and Switzerland.

Foster has established an extremely prolific career in the span of four decades. The following are some of his major constructions:



Foster's other design work has included the Nomos desk system for Italian manufacturer Tecno, and the motor yacht "Izanami" (later "Ronin") for Lürssen Yachts.

Thomas Heatherwick

Thomas Heatherwick (born 17th February 1970) is an English designer and artist. He is known for innovative use of engineering and materials in public monuments and sculptures. He heads the Heatherwick Studio, which he founded in 1994.

Born in London, he studied three dimensional design at Manchester Polytechnic and at the Royal College of Art, winning several prizes. Shortly after graduating from the Royal College of Art after a two-year furniture MA course in 1994, he was commissioned by Harvey Nichols department store in Knightsbridge to design a temporary structure for the shop's facade. His design was a ribbon of laminated wood that wound through the storefront windows. The design was widely acclaimed and won him a D&AD yellow pencil (the gold award) in 1997.

He founded Thomas Heatherwick Studio (now called just Heatherwick Studio) in 1994. His aim was "to bring architecture, design and sculpture together within a single practice". Originally based at Camden Mews, the studio moved to larger premises in Kings Cross in 2000. It presently comprises a thirty-strong team which includes architects, landscape architects, designers and engineers. Work is carried out from a combined studio and workshop where concept development, detailing, prototyping and small scale fabrication take place. The studio's work spans commercial and residential building projects, masterplanning and infrastructure schemes as well as high profile works of public art. 
Heatherwick is a Senior Fellow and external examiner at the Royal College of Art. He is a fellow of the Royal Academy and was recently chosen to become a Royal Designer for Industry. He has served on numerous judging and advisory panels and has given talks at various institutions including the RIBA, Bartlett School of Architecture, the South Africa Design Indaba conference and the Royal Academy. 

In 2004 he curated an exhibition at the Design Museum consisting of 1,000 'every day' design objects that he had collected.

The "B of the Bang" was a £1.42 million 56m-high sculpture of 180 giant spikes, erected outside the City of Manchester Stadium to celebrate the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Safety problems happened soon after it was completed in 2004 when one spike came apart. Eventually 22 more were removed as a safety measure. The object was rewelded and fenced off. It continued to cause concern and debate over its future. Finally Manchester City Council took legal action against Heatherwick studio and their subcontractors, who in November 2008 agreed to pay £1.7 million in damages. The installation was removed in 2009.

The 'East Beach Café' is a building on Littlehampton Sea Front, West Sussex, UK created by Heatherwick. Commissioned in 2005, the large steel structure houses a Café by daytime and restaurant in the evening. The concept allowed the steel to rust and the colours to develop over time before being fixed in a transparent oil. It won the 2008 RIBA Award in the South East region.


Thomas Heatherwick was awarded an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Arts by Manchester Metropolitan University - his alma mater - on July 21, 2007. It is in recognition of his design work across a broad spectrum of architecture, engineering and public art, achieving national and international acclaim for his innovative use of materials, his eclectic range of projects, and the resolution of them in new and exciting ways.

Louver

A louver (American English) or louvre (British English), from the French "l'ouvert"; "the open one") is a window, blind or shutter with horizontal or, less often, vertical slats. They are angled to allow light and air in. They also keep out rain, direct sunshine, and noise. The angle of the slats may be adjusted.

Louvers come from the Middle Ages as lantern-like constructions in wood that were fitted on top of roof holes. They were put in large kitchens to allow ventilation while keeping out rain and snow. They were originally rather rough constructions consisting only of a barrel. Later they became more elaborate designs made of pottery. They took the shape of faces where the smoke and steam from cooking would pour out through the eyes and mouth. They also became more like modern louvers, with slats that could be opened or closed by pulling on a string.

More modern louver windows are made of slats of glass, opened and closed with a metal lever. They may also be shutters of wood, plastic or other material.

Some modern louver systems serve to improve indoor daylighting. Fixed mirrored louver systems can limit glare and of redirect diffuse light. Such louvers may be put in between two panes of double glazing.

Louvers are rarely seen as primary design elements in the language of modern architecture. They are rather simply a technical device. However, there are examples of architects who use them as part of the overall aesthetic effect of their buildings. The most well-known example is Finnish modernist architect Alvar Aalto who would create aesthetic effects in the facades of his buildings through the combination of different types and sizes of louvers. Some are fixed and some are moveable. They are made mostly from wood (e.g. the various buildings of the Helsinki University of Technology). A second example, taking influence from Aalto, is the second-generation modernist architect Juha Leiviskä. 

Additionally, louvers are used as semi-passive means of thermal control on spacecraft. They are also available as an accessory for some automobiles.

Lost (season 6)

The sixth and final season of the American television series "Lost" began broadcast in the United States and Canada on February 2, 2010. In the final 18 TV episodes, the writers showed the fate of the remaining survivors, and explained the powers which the Island held in their lives. The sixth-season premiere was the first to climb in the ratings year-over-year since the second season, drawing 12.1 million viewers. The series finale aired on May 23, 2010. The final episode ran 2.5 hours starting at 9/8 CDT, pushing the late-night news back a half-hour. It was followed by the previously announced post-finale special, "Jimmy Kimmel Live: Aloha to Lost", at 12:05 a.m. (11:05 CDT). The season continued the stories of the survivors of the fictional September 22, 2004 crash of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815, on an unknown island in the South Pacific. The survivors must deal with two outcomes of the explosion of a nuclear bomb on the island in the 1970s. While the on-island story continues, a set of "flash sideways" scenes show a second timeline, in which Flight 815 never crashes. The season is scheduled to be released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 24, 2010, alongside a complete series boxset.
For a summary of the final season's storyline, see below: ""Season 6 plot summary"".

On May 7, 2007, ABC Entertainment President Stephen McPherson announced that "Lost" would end during the 2009–2010 season with a "highly anticipated and shocking finale". "We felt that this was the only way to give "Lost" a proper creative conclusion," McPherson said. Beginning with the 2007–2008 television season, the final 48 episodes would have been aired as three seasons with 16 episodes each, with "Lost" concluding in its sixth season. Due to the 2007-2008 writers' strike, the fourth season featured 14 episodes, and season 5 had 17 episodes. Season six was planned to have 17 episodes, too. However, on June 29 it was announced that the final season would feature an additional hour, making the number of episodes 18. 

Executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse stated that they "always envisioned "Lost" as a show with a beginning, middle, and end," and that by announcing when the show would end that viewers would "have the security of knowing that the story will play out as we've intended." Lindelof and Cuse stated that securing the 2010 series-end date "was immensely liberating" and helped the series rediscover its focus. Lindelof noted, "We're no longer stalling." The producers also planned to wrap up long-standing mysteries, such as the nature of the smoke monster, the reason the Dharma periodic resupply drops continue after the purge, and the "bird" from "Exodus Pt. 2" and "Live Together, Die Alone Pt. 1". While the destruction of the four-toed statue of Taweret was revealed in the ninth episode of the final season, Lindelof hinted that the identity of the statue's builders would not be addressed. The producer also indicated that Walt's unusual abilities may be explained, although not necessarily with the character's direct involvement. In a podcast, Cuse and Lindelof stated that they would explain the "Rules" first stated in an episode in season four, but only those that are "important for the narrative they are telling." Matthew Fox said in an interview that in the final season, the characters of Jack Shephard and John Locke "will come head to head." It was also claimed that a third of the way through the final season, the two timelines would be "solidified into one" and "will be very linear – no more flashbacks, nothing;" however this was still not the case by the season midpoint. He also claimed to be the only cast member to know the ending of the series, though Lindelof has clarified that Fox only knew things that were relevant to his character.

During Comic-Con 2009, numerous sixth-season reports were made. Carlton Cuse stated both the time travel and flash-forward seasons were over, and they were moving into something different for the sixth season. Josh Holloway stated his character Sawyer would revert to his old self after the loss of Juliet. Though Cuse and Lindelof stated that the Dharma Initiative would no longer play a large role in the show, they have said that the "Dharma-Michigan connection" would play a significant role in season six. Lindelof stated that the producers had a direct hand in the production of the season six promotional poster that was first displayed at Comic-Con, and that everything in it was intentional; he also made a reference to the Abbey Road cover in connection to the poster. Season six was the first and only season of Lost ever to not feature any kind of preview or official promotional material such as sneak peeks and promo pictures for future episodes since the Lost producers considered any single frame from the first episodes to be too revealing. According to Lindelof, "even a single scene from the show would basically tip what it is we're doing this year, and what it is we're doing this year is different than what we've done in other years." Lindelof has also emphasized that the flashes-sideways are important, stating "People are saying [they] don't need these stories and all we can say is they're absolutely 100 percent necessary to tell the story of Lost, and hopefully by the end of the season it will be more obvious as to why." He also noted that the term "flash-sideways" was deliberately used instead of "alternate reality" because viewers might otherwise "infer that one of them isn't real, or one of them is real and the other is the alternate to being real." When asked to describe the last three episodes, Lindelof said "Water." 

ABC charged advertisers $900,000 USD for a 30-second commercial during the series finale, in contrast to the standard 2010 season price of $214,000.

The cast features fifteen major roles with star billing: eleven return from the fifth season, one returns from the fourth season after a year's absence, and three are new regular cast members. Unlike the latter half of the previous season, in which the cast was divided into two groups following two separate storylines, Season Six features an alternate universe scenario which the producers call "flash-sideways," and almost all the main characters participate in both storylines. Returning from the fifth season are the survivors' leader Dr. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox); former fugitive Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly); millionaire Hugo "Hurley" Reyes (Jorge Garcia); former torturer Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews); con artist James "Sawyer" Ford (Josh Holloway); medium Miles Straume (Ken Leung); former mob-enforcer Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) and his privileged wife Sun Kwon (Yunjin Kim); leader of the island's native population (known as the "Others") Ben Linus (Michael Emerson); and deceased crash survivor John Locke, who lives on in the sideways timeline but has been possessed in the original timeline by the mysterious Man In Black. Emilie de Ravin returns in her role as Claire Littleton, a new mother who was absent for one season after disappearing on the Island, and Henry Ian Cusick also returns as Desmond Hume, who starts the season off the Island. The new main cast roles go to pilot Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), an ageless advisor to the Others, and mysterious Flight 316 leader Ilana Verdansky (Zuleikha Robinson). Carbonell was named a main cast member by the executive producers at Comic-Con 2009, after guest starring in the previous three seasons, and Fahey and Robinson were confirmed after appearing in recurring roles in the fourth and fifth seasons.

Several former cast members are scheduled to return to the show, or have been asked back. Elizabeth Mitchell returns as fertility specialist Dr. Juliet Burke. Mitchell has stated that her return is "instrumental to the story". Dominic Monaghan returned as rock star Charlie Pace in four episodes. Jeremy Davies returned as physicist Daniel Faraday in multiple episodes. Ian Somerhalder also returned as Flight 815 crash survivor Boone Carlyle in several episodes. Rebecca Mader, who portrays anthropologist Charlotte Lewis, also returned. The producers have also confirmed that Harold Perrineau and Cynthia Watros, who portray Michael Dawson and Libby Smith, respectively, returned in the second half of the season. About the return of Libby, Cuse stated, "Finally, all of your questions [about Libby] will be answered", however, Lindelof jokingly responded, "No, they will not". Michelle Rodriguez, another second season star, returned as police officer Ana Lucia Cortez, following a brief cameo in the fifth season. Maggie Grace, who portrays Shannon Rutherford, Boone's stepsister, was asked to return at the beginning of the season, but Grace was unable due to her schedule; she appeared later in the season, instead. Furthermore, the producers wished to bring back the character of Walt Lloyd, however Malcolm David Kelley, who portrays Walt, has aged significantly and the producers are working to overcome this obstacle.

Recurring characters who returned include: Jack and Claire's father, Dr. Christian Shephard (John Terry), wealthy industrialist and former Other Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), Desmond's wife Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger), former Other Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan), Locke's ex-girlfriend, Helen Norwood (Katey Sagal), Hurley's former boss, Randy Nations (Billy Ray Gallion), mysterious Flight 316 passenger Bram (Brad William Henke), Sayid's wife, Nadia (Andrea Gabriel), deceased Frenchwoman Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), science teacher Leslie Arzt (Daniel Roebuck), the Others' doctor Ethan Rom (William Mapother), Ben Linus' father Roger (Jon Gries), mercenaries Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) and Omar (Anthony Azizi), and Vincent, a dog who survived the crash of Flight 815 and lives on the island. Mark Pellegrino returns in his role as Jacob, the mysterious figure in charge of the island, while Titus Welliver also reprises his role as the mysterious unnamed character, known only as "The Man in Black", who appeared to be antagonistic to him in the season 5 finale. L. Scott Caldwell and Sam Anderson returned in their roles as Rose and Bernard respectively, as does Kimberley Joseph who plays 815 stewardess-turned-Other Cindy. Also, Academy Award-winner Fisher Stevens returns as communications officer George Minkowski from the first few episodes of the fourth season in the eleventh episode. Kevin Tighe returns as Anthony Cooper, Locke's father.

Several new recurring characters were introduced in the sixth season. "Deadwood" actor John Hawkes was cast to portray a character named Lennon and Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada obtained the role of ; both men are Others stationed at the temple. Also, William Atherton was cast in a guest role as the principal of the school where Ben works. Sheila Kelley has been cast in a recurring role that was initially described as "Kendall" and later confirmed to be "Zoe".

The season premiered on February 2, 2010, with a double-length episode (two hours including commercials) preceded by a one-hour clip show, entitled "Lost: Final Chapter". The show continued from February 9 at its new timeslot of Tuesdays at 9 pm, with a total of 18 episodes airing in 16 broadcasts, ending with a two and a half hour, two-part series finale, the latter part of which aired Sunday, May 23, 2010. Additionally, the first hour of the premiere episode was screened to an estimated 15,000 fans on Waikiki Beach on January 30. In the following table, "Series #" refers to the episode's number in the overall series, whereas "Season #" refers to the episode's number in this particular season.

The sixth season followed two timelines, each an outcome of the explosion of a hydrogen bomb in the previous season finale. In the first timeline (referred to as "flash sideways"), Oceanic Flight 815 never crashes but lands with all leaving the airplane at Los Angeles LAX airport. In the second timeline, the remaining survivors return to the present day (on the Island) and must deal with the demise of "Jacob", whose death has been caused by the mysterious Man in Black, the Smoke Monster. According to show producer Damon Lindelof, the term "flash-sideways" was deliberately used instead of "alternate reality" because it might then imply "that one of them isn't real, or one of them is real and the other is the alternate to being real."

On the island, it is revealed that, long long ago, infant "Jacob" and his brother were stolen, from their birth mother, by a woman who raised them to become protectors of the island, after her. At the hidden center of the island, is a waterfall cave containing a bright power source. "Jacob" (with blond hair) and his brother (with black hair, symbolizing white and black) grow up with opposing viewpoints. "Jacob" stays loyal to his adoptive mother, but his brother joins with outsiders on the island. When the brother reveals that they have dug into the core of the island, tapping an underground power to escape, the mother hits the brother with a rock, and she destroys the people in their village. She then chooses "Jacob" to drink the water of immortality. His brother awakens to see the burned village, and seeking revenge, he finds and kills his adoptive mother. "Jacob" discovers her dead body, and in turn, throws his brother into the waterfall cave, transforming him into the black Smoke Monster.

Now centuries later, among the survivors, the Smoke Monster assumes the form of "John Locke", returned to the island in a coffin. This "Locke" had convinced "Ben" to enter the seaside cave and stab "Jacob", who fell into the fire and died. With many survivors believing that "Locke" has been resurrected, they follow him in various plans to leave the island. In one plan, they overthrow the guards at "Widmore's" submarine, and leave the island, unaware that a time bomb is inside the submarine. "Jack" (the doctor) discovers the time bomb, advising them not to disarm it while reasoning that the Smoke Monster cannot kill anyone directly. Instead, "Sawyer" (Ford) refuses to listen and pulls the bomb wires, which, instead, causes the bomb to count down faster. "Sayid" grabs the bomb and runs through the submarine, sacrificing himself to shield the others from the bomb blast. However, the bomb splits the submarine walls, and while sinking, "Sun-Hwa" is trapped in the wreckage, but "Jin" stays with her, vowing to never leave her side again, as they both perish underwater.

"Jack" swims, with a breathing tube, to the surface and back to shore. He tells the rest that "Sun" and "Jin" did not escape. In anger, "Kate" vows to kill "John Locke", for what he has done to their friends. "Sayyid" (the Iraqi guard), "Richard", and "Miles" (son of the DHARMA leader) go to the other island to destroy the airplane. However, crossing at sea, they find the pilot adrift, who convinces them to repair the airplane to escape later.

The spirit of "Jacob" asks who among them would become Protector of the island, and "Jack" volunteers. At the waterfall cave, "Jack" drinks the water of immortality and returns to the group. "Jack" says they must meet with "Locke" and "Desmond" to settle the dispute and kill "Locke". The 2 groups meet on the hilltop, and just the 3 proceed toward the waterfall cave. There, "Desmond" descends on a rope into the cave, but pulls a rock from the bottom, which puts out the light of the power source. The island begins a series of earthquake tremors, to fall into the sea, with rocks tumbling into the water. "Locke" flees the area, now needing to get the sailboat to the other island: he has lost his immortality when the light source was put out. "Jack" chases him to the sea cliffs to stop him from leaving, and a long fight begins. "Locke" grabs a knife and stabs "Jack" in the side, then forces the knife up to "Jack's" neck. Before plunging the knife, a gunshot is heard: "Kate" as promised, has shot "Locke" (the Smoke Monster) in the back, and "Jack" pushes him off the sea cliff, to die on the rocks below.

"Jack" tells them he must return to the island core, as he promised Jacob, to restore the light at the waterfall cave. He instructs "Kate" to leave with "Sawyer" to get "Claire" into the airplane on the other island. "Kate" in turmoil kisses "Jack" goodbye, fearing it will be the last time. "Kate" and "Sawyer" jump into the sea and swim to the sailboat at anchor.

"Hurley" and "Ben" help "Jack" return to the waterfall cave. They lower "Jack" into the cave, where he revives and ties "Desmond" to the rope. "Jack" then puts the missing stone back into the floor, and restarts the light power source. When "Hurley" and "Ben" pull the rope, they find only "Desmond". They call below, but "Jack", overcome by the knife wound and rushing water, never answered, so they take "Desmond" away from the area. Some time later, Jack awakens, alone, outside the cave, as if lifted from the depth of the cave by an unseen force. Dazed, he wanders through the jungle, but he is losing strength. Just as with "Locke's" death, "Jack" also lost his immortality, and protection, at the first time the light source was put out. "Jack" falls to the ground, looking up to the blue sky. At that point, he sees "Kate's" plane flying far overhead, and then closes his eyes, for the last time.

Meanwhile, in the "flash-sideways" view of events, everyone has returned on Oceanic Flight 815, and all have resumed their original lives:
Soon after returning on Flight 815, "Desmond" has been tasked to ensure that bandmember "Charlie" stays sober to appear at a benefit concert for Charles Widmore. "Charlie" keeps talking about some imaginary, profound romance with a blonde girl, as if in some dream. Trying to rebel against "Desmond", he grabs the steering wheel, and the car goes into the harbor. Underwater, looking back inside the car to save "Charlie", he remembers seeing "" written on "Charlie's" hand, but not actually, then pulls him to the surface. They get rescued to the hospital, and Desmond asks, "Who is Penny?". Some memories come back, and Desmond begins to orchestrate a plan: at the school, he hits "John Locke" with his car, causing him to need surgery, led by "Jack Shephard" at the hospital. "Desmond" turns himself in to the police station for "Sawyer", who puts him in a jail cell near "Kate" and "Sayid".

Meanwhile, "Hurley" has been hired to free "Kate", "Sayid" and "Desmond" by paying Officer "Ana Lucia" to detour the prison van to the harbor. They get in 2 cars, and make plans to attend the benefit concert. "Desmond" and "Kate" drive to the church, where "Desmond" meets the funeral van, to accept the casket of "Christian Shephard" ("Jack's" father) into the chapel. This same day, "John Locke" has a 2nd spinal surgery, by "Jack", and regains feeling in his legs. Coming to the hospital to visit "Sun-Hwa", the police officer "Sawyer (Ford)" meets "Juliet" at the snack machines, where they both suddenly remember their parallel life, 3 years together on the island.

Now nighttime, "Hurley" drives "Sayid" to a backstreet, saying that he knows he is really a good guy: a fight breaks out in the alley, and a girl shouts, "Don't hurt my brother!" "Sayid", instinctively, jumps out to rescue her. When he sees her face, he remembers her: ""Shannon?"" Her stepbrother, "Boone" goes to the van and tells "Hurley", he is glad "Sayid" finally arrived because he was getting tired of staging the alley fight for them. "Desmond" attends the concert, where "Daniel Faraday's" mother talks to "Desmond" about the secret plan. While performing on stage, "Charlie" recognizes "Claire" in the audience, as the girl of his dreams, when she leaves to give birth to her son, assisted by "Kate" to get to the hospital.

Finally, "Kate" has convinced "Jack" (only partially aware of his parallel memories) to drive to the church, intended for his father's funeral. There, he enters the chapel, and upon touching his father's casket, he too begins to remember "everything" from the Island, all of them, including his years spent with "Kate". However, upon opening the casket, he finds it empty: his father has assumed a spirit form, and reminds him that he, too, died on the island, in his other life, which was as real as the present day. They both enter the church, where all the former islanders have gathered: "Sun" with "Jin"; "Sawyer" with "Juliet"; "Sayid" with "Shannon"; "Rose" with "Bernard"; "Hurley" with "Libby" (etc.). Even "Desmond" and "Penny" are together there, remembering their parallel life and birth of their child. Everyone who recently landed with Oceanic Flight 815, now greet and hug each other as if old friends, remembering how, once, they all were "lost" but now they have found each other.

Weather map

A weather map is a tool. It is used to show facts and study of many kinds of meteorological amounts at different levels of the atmosphere quickly. They have been used from the mid-19th century. Weather maps have been used both for study and for weather forecasting purposes. Some maps show differences of temperature. This can help find weather fronts. 

People first began using weather charts in a modern way in the mid-19th century. They began using them to make a theory about storm systems. When a telegraph network developed by 1845, it was possible for people to collect information about the weather. They could get the information from many different places far away quickly enough for the information to be useful. In the 1840s, Joseph Henry took charge. He helped the Smithsonian Institution focus most of its observers on the center and the eastern part of the United States during the 1840s and 1860s. The U.S. Army Signal Corps kept up this network between 1870 and 1874 by an act of Congress. It later expanded to the west side.

At first, all the data on the map was not taken from these analyses. This was because there was not enough time standardization. People first tried to standardize time in Great Britain in 1855. The entire United States was not influenced by time zones (areas with different times) until 1905. This was when Detroit had made the standard time at last. Over all the earth, other countries began taking weather observations at the same time. This started in 1873.

A station model is a symbolic picture showing the weather at a reporting station. Meteorologists made the station model to put down many weather elements in a small space on weather maps. Maps thickly filled with station-model plots can be hard to read. However, they help meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns. A computer draws a station model for every place of observation. The station model is mostly used for surface-weather maps. It can also be used to show the weather in the sky, though. A complete station-model map lets people study patterns in air pressure, temperature, wind, cloud cover, and precipitation.

Chaetognatha

Chaetognatha, commonly known as arrow worms, are a phylum of small predatory marine animals. They are present in huge numbers in plankton worldwide. 

About 20% of the known species are benthic and can attach to algae or rocks. They are found in all marine waters from surface tropical waters and shallow tide pools to the deep sea and polar regions. Most chaetognaths are transparent and are torpedo shaped, but some deep-sea species are orange. They range in size from . 

Despite the huge numbers, there are only about 120 modern species in 20 genera. Some species are known to use the neurotoxin "tetrodotoxin" to subdue their prey.

Chaetognaths appear to have originated in the Cambrian Period. Complete body fossils have been described from China, and the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia.

Pepper spray

Pepper spray (also called OC spray, from Oleoresin capsicum) is a spray used for self-defence, by spraying it into an attacker's face. It makes eyes water and causes intense pain, sometimes even leading to temporary blindness. Pepper spray is an inflammatory agent. When someone is sprayed with pepper spray, their eyes will close and they will have difficulty breathing, a runny nose, and cough. The stronger the spray is, the longer the effects last, but the average full effect lasts around thirty to forty-five minutes, with longer effects lasting for hours. Pepper spray is mostly used by police forces for riot control, but in some countries people can use it for self-defence. 

The active in pepper spray is capsaicin, a chemical found in capsicums, chillis and other members of the pepper family. 

Pepper spray usually comes in canisters and can be sprayed up to twenty-five metres.

Lord of the Rings: Conquest

The Game

Lord of the Rings: Conquest is a video game based off the award winning movie “The Lord of the Rings”. It was produced by pandemic studios and published by ea games. This game is out for PC and PlayStation3.

The Training level

The game starts out where the player can choose between Single player and Multiplayer. If singleplayer mode is chosen then the player will have four options: training, new game, load game, or instant action. If Training is selected it will take the player to a level where they will get trained in the moves of every class. It is in the Battle of the Last Alliance, where the elves and the men have to fight against Sauron and his forces.

Classes

"The Warrior"

First the player plays as a warrior. The warrior has three different attacks: the strong attack, the medium attack, and the quick attack. The quick attack is not very powerful, and the strong attack is quite slow, the medium attack is a bit of both. Another attack, which is the ranged attack, is a throwing axe that does a lot of damage, but that takes a long time to come back. There are an amount of special attacks, like the fire sword, which allows three other types of attack. There is also the “crowd-breaker” which is used when the character is blocking. He swings his sword in a very powerful way.

"The Scout"

Then the scout. The scout also has the strong, weak, and medium attacks. His crowd-breaker is he throws a bomb and he has two knives instead of a sword. As his long ranged attack he throws a bomb. He has invisibility and can back-stab people, which can kill them in one attack. When it comes to trolls, he takes away half of the trolls health. 

"The Archer"

Then the archer. The archer cannot block attacks, instead he zooms in making it easier to aim. He has four attacks. One is the normal arrow, than he has the poison arrow. This arrow does the same amount of damage as a normal arrow when it hits, and then slowly decreases their health over time. It makes a green cloud around them, but the effect can be canceled if the character is healed. There is also the fire arrow, which does an enormous amount of damage by exploding upon impact. 

"The Mage"

The last class is the mage. They use magic to defeat their enemies. Their spells consist of lightning bolt, firewall, shield and healing. Lightning is a range attack that can take out single enemies, it can also be charged up and have it bounce from person to person. Fire wall is a spell that creates a circle of flame that damages the enemies if they go near it. The shield is extremely useful. It blocks all range attacks, but not close attacks, or range attacks if they were inside the circle. The mage can also use this to block his allies. If there is an ally archer then they can create a deadly combination of long range and short range, the archer can kick out the enemies. The mage also has an attack where he can hit the ground and damage enemies with an earthquake, this will also knock them out of the shield. Healing is also very useful especially since the mages have less health than most other classes.

Single player mode

"Campaign"

Lord of the Rings: Conquest has two different modes: campaign, instant action. Campaign mode has 16 levels, 8 good and 8 evil, but must it is necessary to finish the good campaign before being able to unlock the evil one. The campaign’s plot follows the movies closely. The campaign can be played in either single player or in multiplayer. It can also be set to 4 different difficulty modes: easy, normal, difficult or heroic. The total game is roughly 8 hours of play but the campaign is not the only the only mode available.

"Instant Action"

Instant action is another playable mode. Like the campaign it allows the player about 16 different scenarios (plus 2 downloadable ones) instantly. There are several different matches that can be played: team death match, capture the ring, and conquest. Team death match makes the player have to kill as many enemies as possible. Capture the ring is where he must take the ring of power to the enemy’s base. The last is Conquest; the objective in this one is to keep as many bases as possible for as long as possible. There is a fourth, a variation of death match called hero team death match where the player exclusively uses heroes.

Multiplayer

"Co-op"

Both story and campaign can be played with a friend, but not the training level. It can only be played by two players, but they can do anything available in singleplayer as long as it was unlocked first.

Online

Instant action can also be played online with anybody else, whenever anybody is online. There are always most probably people who want to play. The story mode, however has to be played with a friend, someone that the player knows and have consciously added, so if the friend with the game is not online, then the campaign cannot be played.

The Taylor Twins and the Case of the Buried Key

The Taylor Twins and the Case of the Buried Key is the first of the Taylor Twin series by American author, Penny Hammer. It was released in paperback. The novel tells the story of two twin twelve-year-olds, Cassandra Taylor and Jack Taylor, who find a note by their neighbor's pond reminding "J" to get rid of heads and they inspect their neighbor, Mr. Wilson, because he might be a murderer. The book was published in 1999 by First Press-TIGE and the cover illustrated by Drawing Board Studios.

The mystery begins when pre-teen twins, Jack and Cassie find a partially buried key in their neighbor's pond and a note telling "J" to "get rid of the heads." The next night, Jack and Cassie make a plan to go investigate the Wilson's property, which they agree to do. Jack starts to dig for bodies in the barn but Mr. Wilson comes in and explains that the key is a key to the vegetable cellar and the note was to store the vegetable heads. Later the next night, Jack explains that there he saw a light turn on uptstairs, inferring there must have been two people in the house. They go to the house again, and Jack sees "a crazy man in room with paintings of animals in the room missing their heads." At dinner, Jack and Cassie ask questions about the people that live there and they conclude Jack was right about two people living there. So they go to the house again that night and they get caught in the vegetable cellar. While inside, Mr. Wilson explains that when his mother passed on, his brother, Jay, became interested in cutting off pet's heads, including his own, and he now keeps Jay locked in the bedroom upstairs.

Alexei Shirov

Alexei Shirov (born 4 July 1972 in Riga, Latvia) is a chess grandmaster. He has consistently ranked among the world's top players since the early 1990s, and reached a ranking as high as number four in 1998. Shirov is also a well-regarded chess author. 

Shirov became the World Champion (under 16) in 1988, and achieved the title of grandmaster in 1990. He is the winner of numerous international tournaments.

In 1998 Shirov's ranking rose to number four in the world. On the basis of his rating, he was invited to play a ten game match against Vladimir Kramnik to select a challenger for World Champion Garry Kasparov. Shirov won the match with two wins, no losses and seven draws. However the plans for the Kasparov match fell through when funds could not be raised. When Kasparov played Kramnik for the world title in 2000, Shirov maintained that the match was invalid and he was the rightful challenger.

In 2000, Shirov reached the final of the FIDE World Chess Championship, losing to Viswanathan Anand.

In May/June 2007 he played in the Candidates Tournament of the FIDE World Chess Championship. He won his first round match against Michael Adams (+1-1=4, won in rapid playoff), but was eliminated when he lost his second round match to Levon Aronian (+0-1=5). In November/December 2007 Shirov played in the Chess World Cup. He lost in the final 2.5-1.5 to Gata Kamsky.

In May 2009, Alexei Shirov achieved the greatest triumph of his career by placing 1st in the high Category 21 M-Tel Masters 2009 tournament, a double round tournament held in Sofia, Bulgaria. He was undefeated, and scored 6.5/10—seven draws and three victories, two against Vassily Ivanchuk and the other against Magnus Carlsen in the final round. By this success he was given entry to the Grand Slam Chess Final 2009 in Bilbao where he met Levon Aronian, Sergey Karjakin (winner of Corus 2009), and Alexander Grischuk (winner of Linares 2009). 

In 1994 Shirov married, and later divorced, Verónica Alvarez, moved to Tarragona, and became a citizen of Spain. He married, then later divorced, Lithuanian IM/WGM Viktorija Čmilytė from 2001 to 2008. Although he still plays for Spain, he now lives in Latvia. 

Shirov is noted for his attacking style and for seeking complications, a tendency which has led to comparisons with fellow Latvian and former world champion, Mikhail Tal, under whom he studied in his youth.

During the 1998 Linares chess tournament Shirov played black against future FIDE world champion Veselin Topalov and won with a piece sacrifice in a bishop and pawn ending.

<doc id="246234" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246234" title="Lactase">
Lactase

Lactase is an enzyme which acts on lactose, breaking it down so it can be digested. 

Mammals in their infancy usually make lactase: they need it for digesting the lactose found in their mother's milk. Mammalian adults usually lose the capacity to produce lactase. Thus, if you give milk to an adult cat it causes discomfort and diarrhea.

Humans are somewhat different. Some humans continue to produce lactase, and some do not. It is a type of polymorphism.

The ability to digest lactose into adulthood ('lactase persistence') was useful to humans after the invention of animal husbandry. This developed animals that gave a consistent supply of milk. 

Hunter-gatherer populations before the Neolithic revolution were overwhelmingly lactose intolerant. So are modern hunter-gatherers. 

A mutation on chromosome #2 stops the shutdown in lactase production, making it possible for those with the mutation to continue drinking fresh milk (and eating other dairy products) throughout their lives.

This appears to be a recent adaptation to dairy consumption. It has occurred independently in both northern Europe and East Africa in populations with a pastoral lifestyle. Lactase persistence, allowing lactose digestion to continue into adulthood, is a dominant allele, making lactose intolerance a recessive trait. 

Genetic studies suggest that the oldest mutations associated with lactase persistence only reached appreciable levels in human populations in the last ten thousand years. Therefore, lactase persistence is often cited as an example of recent human evolution. As lactase persistence is genetic, but animal husbandry a cultural trait, this is gene–culture coevolution.

NBA TV

NBA TV is a television specialty channel that is dedicated to showcasing the sport of basketball in the United States. The network is financially backed by the National Basketball Association (NBA), which also uses NBA TV as a way of advertising their out of market package NBA League Pass, and partner channel TNT. 

Started in 1999 as nba.com tv, the channel, which had its studios at NBA Entertainment in Secaucus, New Jersey, began a multi-year deal with American television companies Cox Communications, Cablevision, and Time Warner on June 28, 2003, allowing the network to expand to 45 million American homes, and 30 different countries. NBA TV replaced Time Warner's CNN/SI on many cable systems after that network shut down a year earlier.

NBA TV offers basketball news every day, as well as programming showcasing basketball players' individual lifestyles, life as a basketball team during an NBA season, famous games of the past, and live games typically four days a week during the NBA season. Live games on NBA TV are subject to local blackout restrictions, since NBA TV does not have exclusive broadcast rights to any of its games. Games carried by NBA TV are always also carried by each team's local rights holder.

The channel also shows international games, typically on Saturday evenings, with special emphasis on the Euroleague and the Maccabi Tel Aviv team from Israel. In April 2005, the channel televised the Chinese Basketball Association finals for the first time. 
NBA TV carries at least 90 regular-season games per season, all broadcast in high definition, as well as some first-round playoff games. It also broadcasts WNBA games nationally (subject to local blackout).

The channel's flagship program is "NBA Gametime Live", a show in which a host and studio analysts go over the latest news, highlights, and look in at games in progress. The show is live six days a week, not airing on most Thursdays due to NBA's coverage of "The NBA on TNT". An edited one hour/thirty minute version of the broadcast is repeated throughout the late night/early morning hours.


The studio host and analysts vary every night on NBA Gametime Live.



On October 8, 2007, it was reported that Turner Sports, a division of Time Warner, was to take over the channel's operations, according to
Hoopsworld:
"NBATV: Surprisingly there has been little said about the NBA's decision to sell off NBATV to one of its media partners. Talks had gone on for as ESPN/ABC and Turner both explored scenarios with the league. Ultimately it seems Turner has won out, and will take over operation of the league's flagship cable channel, that reaches some 12 million subscribers. The exact changeover date is not clear, but several months ago a Bloomberg report cited sources saying senior level producers were offered contract buyouts in September."

Turner Sports relaunched the channel on October 28, 2008, using analysts carried over from NBA on TNT.

In 2001, Raptors NBA TV begin airing in Canada. Although quite similar to NBA TV, there is a larger focus on the Toronto Raptors basketball team, due to Canadian content requirements and restrictions on foreign ownership (the channel is owned by Raptors parent company Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, not the league). 

As of 2010, NBA TV coverage can be seen in 40 countries via the following partners:


NBA TV HD is a 1080i high definition simulcast of NBA TV. All studio programs and original shows are shot in HD, and all live games and recent game rebroadcasts are shown in HD. For programs not available in HD (such as older game footage), unique stylized pillarboxes are used, the NBA logo with "NBA TV" under it, or alternately, just "NBA TV" sideways. Both are in black and gray

On April 16, 2009, it was announced that DirecTV and the NBA reached a new carriage agreement. NBA TV was moved from the satellite television provider's add on Sports Pack (and premium subscription package NBA League Pass) to its lower priced base package Choice Xtra on October 1, 2009. DirecTV believes the move will make the channel available to an additional 8 million subscribers. 

On June 4, 2009, it was announced that the NBA and Comcast have reached a deal to move the channel from the cable company's add on Sports Entertainment Package to its basic level Digital Classic package, by the start of the 2009-10 NBA season. Comcast believes an additional 8 million customers will now have access to the channel.

Verizon FiOS added the channel and NBA League Pass for the first time on September 23, 2009. 

The channel also signed new multiyear agreements with Time Warner Cable, Cablevision, and Dish Network on October 22, 2009. They also reached a new deal with Cox Cable earlier this year. 

With all of the above carriage deals, the NBA believes it will now reach 45 million viewers.

Manic Street Preachers

Manic Street Preachers (often referred to as the Manics) are an alternative rock band from Blackwood, Wales, formed in 1986. They are James Dean Bradfield (vocals, guitars), Nicky Wire (bass, occasional vocals) and Sean Moore (drums, backing vocals, occasional trumpet). The band is part of the Cardiff music scene. Their biggest success was during the 1990s.

The band were originally a four piece band: lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards mysteriously vanished on 1 February 1995. In November 2008, 13 years after his disappearance, he was officially declared presumed dead.

The Manics released their debut album "Generation Terrorists" in 1992. Their combination of androgynous glam punk imagery, outspoken
invective and songs about "culture, alienation, boredom and despair" soon gained them a loyal following and cult status. The band's later albums kept a politicized and smart lyrical style. They also adopted a broader alternative rock sound. Enigmatic lyricist Richey Edwards gained early notoriety by carving the words "4 REAL" into his arm with a razor blade (narrowly missing an artery and requiring seventeen stitches) in response to the suggestion that the band were less than authentic. The dark nature of 1994's "The Holy Bible" showed the result of Edwards' instability.

Following Edwards' disappearance, Bradfield, Moore, and Wire kept with the Manic Street Preachers and went on to gain critical and commercial success. They became one of Britain's top rock bands. They have had eight top ten albums and fifteen top ten singles. They have reached number one three times, with their 1998 album "This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours" and the singles "If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next" (1998) and "The Masses Against The Classes" (2000). They have also won the Best British Album and Best British Group accolades at the BRIT Awards in 1997 and 1999, and were lauded by the NME for their lifetime achievements in 2008. Their ninth studio album, "Journal For Plague Lovers", was released on 18 May 2009 and features lyrics Edwards had left behind to the band weeks before his disappearance.

Regional casino

A Regional Casino, more commonly known as a Super Casino (or occasionally known as Mega Casino), is the term given to the largest category of casino that was to have been permitted under UK law. It is meant to be the same size as the larger casinos in Las Vegas. The first Regional Casino was proposed to be in the City of Manchester. This was stopped by the UK government soon after Gordon Brown became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

The Gambling Act 2005 revised many regulations relating to gambling in England. Amongst the most controversial provisions was the establishment of a number of 'destination casinos' in the style of Las Vegas, commonly referred to in the media as 'Super Casinos'

Initial drafts of the act proposed eight regional casinos but concerns expressed in the national media and by a range of addiction related social and religious groups meant that the final revision of the act permitted only one casino of the largest size, referred to as a 'Regional Casino', with a further eight 'large' and eight 'small' casinos of a smaller sizes and with reduced Jackpot limits.

Prior to the act there were 140 casinos in the UK, the largest of which in Star City, Birmingham had a floor area of around 950 square metres. Customers were required to register twenty-four hours prior to gaming.

Under the terms of the Gambling Act the Secretary of State is able to define each type of Casino, with reference to any matter he or she chooses; although the act specifically mentions as facts to consider the number, location and concentration of gaming tables, and the floor area designated for a specific purpose.

Definitions have been determined such that the 'super casino' will have a minimum customer area of 5000 square metres and at most 1250 unlimited-jackpot slot machines.

'Large casinos' will have a minimum area of 1000 square metres and up to 150 slot machines with a maximum jackpot of £4000.

The 'small casinos' will have a minimum customer area of 750 sq metres, up to 80 slot machines and a jackpot of £4000.

In May 2006, a short-list of eight sites, selected from various ones submitted by local councils, was announced for the location of the Regional Casino. These were:

On 30 January 2007 it was announced that the first Regional Casino would be built in East Manchester near the City of Manchester Stadium. This was a shock to the Blackpool and The O (formerly the Millennium Dome) bids. Both of them were thought of as the favourites. However, the Blackpool bid organisers pledged to continue the work in getting government approval for a 'supercasino'.

Royal Institute of British Architects

The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) is a professional organisation for architects in the United Kingdom.

It was originally named the Institute of British Architects in London and formed in 1834. The group was started by several important architects, including Philip Hardwick, Thomas Allom, William Donthorne, Thomas Leverton Donaldson, John Buonarotti Papworth and Thomas de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey. It was awarded a Royal Charter in 1837, becoming the Royal Institute of British Architects in London, eventually dropping the reference to London in 1892.

The RIBA is a member organisation, with 44,000 members. Chartered Members are allowed to call themselves chartered architects and to add the post-nominals RIBA after their name; Student Members are not permitted to do so. In the past, fellowships of the institute were given, but this has stopped; those who continue to hold this title instead add FRIBA.

RIBA is based at 66 Portland Place, London—a 1930s Grade II* listed building designed by architect George Grey Wornum with sculptures by Edward Bainbridge Copnall and James Woodford. The Institute also maintains a dozen regional offices around the United Kingdom. Parts of the London building are open to the public, including the exhibition galleries and Library. It has a large architectural bookshop, a café, restaurant and lecture theatres. Rooms are hired out for events.

Bahrain International Circuit

The Bahrain International Circuit (BIC) is a motorsport track opened in 2004 and used for auto racing. The main race is the Bahrain Grand Prix. The 2004 Grand Prix was the first held in the Middle East. In 2006, Australian V8 Supercar started racing at the BIC. 24 Hour endurance races also hosted at BIC. 

Building the Bahrain circuit (track) was important for Bahrain, and was started by the Crown Prince, Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa. The Crown Prince is the Honorary President of the Bahrain Motor Federation. 

In the track became the first Grand Prix circuit to be awarded the distinguished (important) FIA Institute Centre of Excellence award. The award was given for having and keeping high race safety and medical facilities.

The track was designed by German architect Hermann Tilke. Tilke also designed the Sepang circuit in Malaysia. The track cost approximately US $150 million to build. It can be set-up as six different tracks, including a test oval and a drag strip.

The track had a special problem. The track was located in the middle of a desert. There were concerns that sand would blow onto the track and disrupt the race. Organizers (the people who run the race) were able to keep the sand off the track by spraying an adhesive (glue) on the sand around the track.

The surface of the track has a high level of grip. The same surface is used at the Yas Marina Circuit for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

The Bahrain International Circuit hosts a number of races, including the FIA Formula One World Championship, the Australian V8 Supercar Championship Series, the GP2 Series, GP2 Asia, Chevrolet Lumina Series, Speedcar Series, Thunder Arabia and Radical.

In the past the track has hosted the FIA GT Championship, and a one-time Bahrain Superprix involving Formula Three cars, following from the failure of the Korea Super Prix. The first Formula BMW World Final took place in Bahrain. Every year there is the 24 Hours of Bahrain race.

The first Bahrain Grand Prix took place on 4 April 2004, making history as the first Formula One Grand Prix to be held in the Middle East. Other countries, including Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates wanted to host the Formula One Grand Prix.

The Bahrain Grand Prix is usually the third race on the Formula One schedule. In the 2006 season, Bahrain traded places with the usual first race, the Australian Grand Prix. The Australian Grand Prix date was changed to avoid interfering with the Commonwealth Games. In , Bahrain was moved to the fourth race on the schedule. In , Bahrain was the first race of the season. For 2010, the Formula One cars raced on the full "Endurance Circuit". 

Starting in 2011, Formula One will return to the original track layout. This is the layout that was used in 2004.

Wind turbine

A wind turbine is a rotating device that creates kinetic energy from the windy blasts. If the mechanical energy is used directly by machinery, such as for pumping water, cutting lumber or grinding stones, the machine is called a windmill. If the mechanical energy is instead converted to electricity, the machine is called a wind generator, wind turbine, wind power unit (WPU), wind energy converter (WEC), or aerogenerator.
ALthough wind turbines are a good source of energy and don't pollute the environment, they have a massive environmental impact.
Many people think that wind turbines create a lot of noise, however they don't produce as much noise as you think. Next time you are near a wind farm, listen out for them.

Wet-tail

Wet-tail or proliferative ileitis, is a disease in rodents kept in cages, mainly hamsters, but can include rabbits, gerbils, rats, and mice. It is caused by stress. Even with treatment, the animal can die within 24-48 hours. Baby hamsters are much more likely to get the disease than older hamsters. It commonly is found when the hamster is being weaned at about four weeks of age.

Wet-tail is a disease in the animal's intestines caused by the bacteria, "Lawsonia intracellularis". Wet-tail is stress related. The stress can be caused by:


The symptoms may not appear for several days. The main symptom is the animal has a wet tail, matted with faeces. Other signs of the disease are: 

There are drugs to treat wet-tail which can be bought from pet shops. A vet may choose to give the animal other drugs. The sick animal should be kept in a cage by itself so that others do not catch the disease.

A contactless smart card is in a card pocket-sized (usually as big as a credit card) card with integrated circuits that can process and save data. They can receive information which is processed and delivered through radio. There are two main kinds of contactless smart cards. Many people believe contactless smart cards have a read-only RFID inside it. This is not true, but they do have a re-writable smart card microchip inside them. Contactless smart cards can be used for identification, authentication, and saving up data.

Pericles' Funeral Oration

Pericles' Funeral Oration is a famous speech from Thucydides' "History of the Peloponnesian War". The speech was delivered by Pericles at the end of the first year of the Peloponnesian War (431 - 404 BCE). He was a famous Athenian politician. The speech was a part of the yearly public funeral for the people who died in the war.

At that time, people in Athens had a custom of holding a public funeral for the people who died in war. The bodies of the dead were left out for three days in a tent, where offerings could be made for the dead.

"Funeral Oration" was recorded by Thucydides in book two of his "History of the Peloponnesian War". Thucydides records the speech as if every word in the record was what Pericles said. However, people agree he did, at least, correct or change the speeches a little. Thucydides says in his "History" that the speeches are not completely the same as what was really said, but written to show the main ideas of what was said. It is quite certain that Pericles delivered a speech at the end of the first year of the war. However, people are not sure how much Thucydides' record is the same as Pericles' actual speech.

The Funeral Oration is important because the speech was different from usual Athenian funeral speeches. David Cartwright describes it as "a eulogy (description) of Athens itself...". The speech is about what great things Athens did, delivered to encourage the people.

American Civil War scholar Garry Wills calls Abraham Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address the modern parallel to Pericles' Funeral Oration.

Gorgoneion

In Ancient Greece, the Gorgoneion (Greek: Γοργόνειον) was originally a magic pendant showing the Gorgon's head. (The use of magic against evil, or bad luck is generally called Apotropaism). 
The gorgoneion was linked with the gods Zeus and Athena; both are said to have worn it as a pendant. It was also popular as a royal symbol, worn on shields and capes. These can be seen on the Alexander Mosaic and the Gonzaga Cameo.

Homer wrote about the Gorgon on four occasions, but only about the head, as if the creature had no body. Jane Ellen Harrison notes that "Medusa is a head and nothing more...a mask." The body was added many years later. Up to the 5th century BC, the head was shown as being very ugly, with her tongue sticking out, boar tusks, puffy cheeks, her eyeballs staring straight ahead and the snakes twisting all around her. 

The direct frontal stare was highly unusual in ancient Greek art.. In some cases a beard, (probably representing streaks of blood) was added to her chin, making her appear as a wild and sexual god, like Dionysus.

Gorgoneia painted on the shields of warriors on mid-5th century Greek vases are not as ugly, strange or frightening. By that time, the Gorgon had lost her tusks and the snakes were rather stylized. The Hellenistic marble known as the Medusa Rondanini shows how the Gorgon changed over time into a beautiful woman.

Gorgoneia are first seen in Greek art at the beginning of the 8th century BC. One of the earliest is on a coin found during an archaelogical dig at Parium. Other early 8th-century examples were found at Tiryns. There is a similar image from the Knossos palace, dating from the 15th century BC. Marija Gimbutas even argues that "the Gorgon extends back to at least 6000 BC, as a ceramic mask from the Sesklo culture illustrates".

In the 6th century BC, gorgoneia of a basic type of "lion mask" were found all over Greek temples, especially in and around Corinth. Pedimental gorgoneia were common in Sicily; probably the earliest one is in the Temple of Apollo in Syracuse. Around 500 BC, they stopped being used to decorate monumental buildings, but were still shown on parts of the roof tiles (antefix) of smaller buildings throughout the next century. 

As well as temples, the Gorgon image can be found on dress, dishes, weapons, and coins across the Mediterranean region from Etruria to the Black Sea coast. The Gorgon coins were made in 37 cities, making her image on coins second only to some of the main Greek gods. On mosaic floors, the gorgoneion was usually near the door, as if guarding it. On Attic kilns, a gorgoneion over the kiln door protected from accidents. 

The Gorgon image remained popular even in Christian times, especially in the Byzantine Empire, including Kievan Rus (now the Ukraine). The image was used in Western Europe by the Italian Renaissance artists. In the 20th century, the gorgoneion was used by Gianni Versace as a logo for his fashion company.

Gimbutas says the gorgoneia are part of of the Mother Goddess cult linked to "dynamic life energy". She said the gorgoneion is a typical European image. Jane Ellen Harrison, on the other hand, claims that many primitive cultures use similar ritual masks. These are meant to scare the owner from doing something wrong, or, as she terms it, to make an ugly face at him.

Gustave Courbet

Jean Désiré Gustave Courbet (10 June 1819–31 December 1877) was a French painter. He was the leader of the Realist movement in 19th-century French painting. Courbet is very important in French painting for two reasons. Firstly, he was prepared to try out new ideas and ways of painting. Secondly, his paintings made social comment on the world around him. In other words, he was not afraid to show "real life" in a way that was not always beautiful and nice. 

Courbet's paintings were an inspiration to many other painters, particularly the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. Edouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Vincent van Gogh and Henri Toulouse-Lautrec were all inspired by Gustave Courbet's paintings of people. His landscape paintings were an inspiration to Claude Monet, Seurat, Cezanne and many other painters. 

Courbet was born in 1819, and was the son of Régis and Sylvie Oudot Courbet in Ornans, Doubs. Courbet's sisters, Zoé, Zélie and Juliette, were his first models for drawing and painting. 

When Courbet was twenty he went to Paris in 1839, and worked at the studio of two other painters, Steuben and Hesse. He was not happy there, and wanted to work on his own. He studied the works of many great masters, including Goya, Velazquez and Titian. He painted several self-portraits at this time. He often returned home to Ornans to hunt, fish and find inspiration in the countryside and country life.

In 1846–1847 Coubet travelled to the Netherlands and Belgium where he studied the paintings of Rembrandt, Franz Hals and Jan Steen who all painted in the 1600s. The paintings by these artists often showed realistic scenes and portraits of everyday life. They showed ordinary people at the table together, dancing, writing, cooking, working at trades and in businesses and in the fields. There were many pictures of soldiers. Courbet decided that he wanted to paint scenes of ordinary life the way that these artists did. He did not want to paint scenes from literature, history or mythology like most other artists in France at that time. 

Courbet painted a large picture of everday-life at Ornans. The painting, called "After Dinner at Ornans", shows four men who have just finished a meal at a little table, which is perhaps in an inn. One man is playing his violin, one man is lighting his pipe. Courbet sits listening, with his head leaning on his hand. A large dog is curled under a chair. Courbet showed the painting at the Salon Exhibition in Paris. It was a great success. It won a Gold Medal and was bought by the French Government. Because of the gold medal, Courbet could hang his pictures at the Salon Exhibitions without having them checked by a jury first. (This rule was changed in 1857.) Courbet's work, along with the work of Honoré Daumier and Jean-François Millet, became known as "Realism". Like the Dutch painters that he admired, Courbet often painted in broad, rough brush strokes. He often used dark earthy colours, particularly brown, in his paintings.

In 1849 Courbet saw two people working by the roadside, using small hammers to break large rocks into gravel. One was an old man and the other was a young boy. Courbet painted a picture of this scene. He explained it to a friend ""It is not often that one meets with so complete an expression of poverty and so, right then and there I got the idea for a painting. I told them to come to my studio the next morning."" 

The picture soon became one of the most famous scenes of the life of poor people that has ever been painted. It was destroyed during World War II in Dresden.

Courbet's other important painting that was shown at the Salon of 1850 was a scene of life at his village. Beginning in 1849, he painted the funeral of his great-uncle who had died the previous year. Courbet got all the village people who had been at the funeral to come to his studio and pose for him, one by one, until the painting was complete. The painting was very large, 10 by 22 feet (3.1 by 6.6 meters). The famous artist Jacques Louis David had once painted a very large picture in the same way. David's picture was of the "Coronation of Napoleon" and showed all the people who were present. 

Some people praised "The Funeral at Ornans" but other people were very angry about it. They thought that it was wrong to show the burial of an ordinary man in a huge painting, as if he was as important as an emperor. They thought that it was wrong to show the poor people of a village, with their old clothes and dirty boots, as if they were all as important as lords and ladies. Some of the critics said that Courbet was deliberately trying to paint ugliness. Many people came to see the picture and liked the new Realist way of painting. Courbet said: ""The Burial at Ornans was ... the burial of Romanticism."" 

Courbet became a celebrity. (He became famous and written about in the newspapers- like a film star.) People said he was a genius, a "terrible socialist", and a "savage". 
Courbet wrote to a friend in 1850:
During the 1850s Courbet painted many other pictures using common folk and friends as his subjects, such as "Village Damsels" (1852), the "Wrestlers" (1853), "Bathers" (1853), "The Sleeping Spinner" (1853), and "The Wheat Sifters" (1854).

Courbet then painted another huge picture. This painting is called "The Artist's Studio" and is about seven years in his life as a painter. He shows himself at the centre of the picture, working on a large landscape painting. Behind him is an artists' model, who is naked. All around Courbet are his friends and people from his village. His mother stands to one side of the picture. Another woman is sitting on the floor feeding her baby. A little boy watches the artist, while a white cat plays on the floor. 

In 1855 Coubet took this picture, with "Burial at Ornan" and twelve other paintings to be shown in a big international exhibition in Paris called "Exposition Universelle". The two biggest paintings and another one were sent away because there was not enough room. Courbet was angry. He had his own building put up, and showed forty of his paintings. Many other artists praised Courbet, but some people laughed at him, and the public did not buy very many of his pictures. Because of what he had done, younger artists heard about him and admired him. These included James McNeill Whistler in the United States as well as Édouard Manet in France.

In 1857 Courbet showed six pictures in the Salon exhibition. One was a hunting scene and one was a picture of two prostitutes lying under a tree on the banks of the River Seine in Paris. Many people came to see the exhibition and to buy his paintings. The hunting scenes were very popular for decorating the halls and dining rooms of large houses. 

For the rest of his life, Courbet painted erotic (sexy) pictures like the picture of the prostitutes, and also many more hunting scenes. His last erotic painting was called "The Origin of the World" and was a close-up painting of female genitals. This painting was not shown in a public exhibition until 1988. He also painted very many landscapes, which he began by doing outdoor sketches, then made into big paintings in his studio. By the 1870s Courbet was thought of as one of the leading artists in France. The emperor offered to make Courbet a member of the Légion d'honneur which was the highest honour in France, but Courbet refused to accept it. He believed that he belonged to the poor and ordinary people, not to the high and mighty.

At this time, there were many political problems in France. Courbet became involved in the political problems. In 1871, he was blamed because a public monument called the Vendôme Column had been demolished. He was put in prison for six months. In 1873, the new government expected him to pay to have the monument restored and put back. He did not have enough money so left France to live in Switzerland. The government decided to make terms so that Courbet could pay for the column in yearly payments of 10,000 francs for 33 years. Courbet died at La Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland, on 31 December 1877, one day before the first payment was due. He was 58 and died of liver disease, made worse by heavy drinking.

<doc id="246500" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246500" title="Dispute">
Dispute

A dispute is a continuing disagreement carried on between two or more parties. The parties may be people, or they may be organisations or countries. Disputes can last a long time, and they can have serious results. Disputes may become conflicts. Disputes between individual people may lead to violence. Disputes between organisations may lead to legal action. Disputes between countries may lead to war.

Several factors make disputes more serious. Serious disputes may do a lot of damage to the people involved, and to their societies. 

Disputes may last for long periods, and the longer they last, the more damage they may do. Where disputes involve religions, or hostile countries, they may last for more than a lifetime. Generations of children may be taught that their side is completely right, and the other wrong. 

Disputes arise when there are conflicting needs, values or ideas. Differences of religion and culture are a common cause of disputes. Self-interest is a common cause of disputes between individuals. 

A second factor is the use of books, newspapers, radio and television by each side to promote their side of the argument. This propaganda helps to continue and spread the dispute.

Laws may prevent freedom of speech, and prevent discussion in print or other media. This makes it difficult for either side to see merit in the other point of view. In turn, this makes it difficult for compromise or tolerance to dissolve the dispute.

The study of disputes and conflicts reached its peak during the Cold War. Then the West versus East conflict seemed to threaten world peace, and many ideas were put forward to use negotiation as a tool to calm the tension. Negotiation about the reduction of nuclear weapons was successful.

The tension was finally reduced by the unexpected end of the Soviet Union, and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe. This was not achieved by negotiation. The reasons for the end of the Soviet Union are still being debated.

Professional help may be available. Between people, there are counsellors; between organisations there are specialists in conflict resolution; between countries there is the United Nations. 

Some disputes do fade with the passage of time, though the time may be much longer than a human lifetime. Conflict between religions may fade only after centuries, and there is no known process of mediation.

All legal systems have provisions for making decisions in disputes. Usually the cases are based on claims about money, between individual people or between 'corporate entities'. These are companies or other organisations. Usually, the law can only be used if it can reach a decision based on evidence. Law textbooks list which disputes which may be addressed by law, and which can not.

Force has been used many times to enforce one side of the other to submit. Wars have been based on disputes, or disputes have been used as an excuse for wars. However, force has also been used to keep warring groups apart, and calm people down. Both the European Union and the United Nations have used peace-keeping forces in areas under violent dispute.

Education may be used to harden opinion and make a dispute worse, or it may be used to open people's minds to unpopular ideas. Education which helps people to think for themselves and keep an open mind is thought to reduce prejudice and conflict.

Democracy is one way of easing conflict within a country. It is not a perfect solution, for small groups may feel they are permanently excluded from power. Free speech and freedom from censorship exist to some extent in democracies. These freedoms are valuable to minority groups inside a country. Countries that have these freedoms are called open or liberal democracies. 

Of course, there are many disputes between individual people, but disputes between large groups or nations are of very great importance.

Possession Island, Queensland

Possession Island is a small island in the Torres Strait, near Cape York in far northern Queensland, Australia.

The island is called Bedanug or Bedhan Lag by the indigenous Australian people, the Kaurareg people. During his first voyage of discovery James Cook sailed north along the east coast of Australia, landing at Botany Bay. Reaching the tip of Queensland, he named and landed on Possession Island, just before sunset on Wednesday 22 August 1770. He said that the east coast was now British territory under the control of King George III.

He wrote in his journal:

In 2001 the Kaurareg successfully claimed native title rights over the island (and other nearby islands).

Possession Island is located at the centre of the Possession Island National Park. This park has an area of 5.10 km², and was made a protected area in 1977. It is looked after by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.

Martin Gardner

Martin Gardner (October 21, 1914May 22, 2010) was an American writer. He had many interests, so he wrote about many topics. He wrote about mathematics, magic, literature, philosophy, skepticism, and religion. He wrote the "Mathematical Games" column in the "Scientific American" magazine from 1956 to 1981. After that, he wrote the "Notes of a Fringe Watcher" column in the "Skeptical Inquirer" magazine. He published over 70 books.

Gardner also sometimes wrote under pen names. As "Uriah Fuller" he wrote "Confessions of a Psychic". As "George Groth", he criticized his book, "The Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener". 



Note: Gardner also wrote some books on magic for professional magicians. These books are not listed here.

Martin Gardner's columns from "Scientific American" are printed in 15 books. Don Knuth calls these books "the Canon".

Three other books print some or all of Martin Gardner's columns from Scientific American:

Nuclear fuel is a material that can be consumed to take over nuclear energy, by analogy to chemical fuel that is burned for energy. Nuclear fuels are the most dense sources of energy available. 

Most nuclear fuels contain heavy "fissile" elements which to undergo a nuclear fission chain reaction in a nuclear reactor. The most common nuclear fuels are uranium and plutonium but not all nuclear fuels are used in reactors.

Manicure

A manicure is something a nail technician does to make someone's nails more beautiful. Manicures can be done at home or by a professional in a nail salon.
During a manicure, the nail is filed with a nail file; the free edge of the nail is cut, the cuticle is treated, the person's hand is massaged and nail polish is put on.

5000 years ago, manicures were first used. Henna was used in India for manicure. The word mehendi, another word for henna, derives from the Sanskrit mehandika. Cixi, the Dowager Empress of China, had very long naturally-grown nails.

Dietitian

A dietitian or dietician is an expert in food and nutrition.
Dietitians help promote good health through proper eating. They often write custom diets for people.
In a medical setting they can give food supplements for those people who can not get what they need because of swallowing problems.
Dietitians want to find, cook and serve tasty, attractive and healthy food to patients, their families and health care providers.

In many countries only people with specific degrees can call themselves dietitians.
The term nutritionist is widely used as it is not controlled like the title dietitian, but the word nutritionist can be used without having the qualifications of registered dietitians.
A nutritionist is not a dietitian as he is not registered to a national board and does not have the same qualifications.
Dietitians are important in the medical multi-disciplinary team because they are experts in nutrition and can give advice to doctors, nurses, and other health care workers.

Mycology

Mycology is the study of fungi (fungus). This includes their genetics, their biochemical properties (the chemical processes in them), their classification, their use to humans and their dangers (poisonous or infectious) . Fungi are a source of tinder (easily combustible material to light fires), medicines, food, and entheogens (a psychoactive substance). 
A biologist who sdudies mycology is called a mycologist. 

Mycology is closely related to phytopathology (the study of plant diseases) because most plant diseases are caused by fungi. 
Historically, mycology was a branch of botany (plant biology). Now fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants.

Fungi are fundamental (essential) for life on earth: they're symbionts (an organism living in a mutually benefical relationship with another organism from a different species), they have potency in breaking sown complex organic biomolecules and they play a role in our global carbon cycle.

Webster-Hayne debate

The Webster-Hayne debate was a famous debate in the United States between Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts and Senator Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina. It happened on January 19-27, 1830. It was about protectionist tariffs. The speeches between Webster and Hayne themselves were not planned. They had burst forth from arguments about a decision by Connecticut Senator Samuel Foote. Foote had temporarily stopped land surveying until land already on the market was sold. Webster's "Second Reply to Hayne" (1830) was widely seen as "the most eloquent speech ever delivered in Congress."

Webster described the US government as "made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people". This influenced Abraham Lincoln later. He spoke the words "government of the people, by the people, for the people" in his Gettysburg Address.

Cook wrote that it was Lieutenant Zachary Hickes who first saw land, and Cook named the point after him. Hickes spelt his name with an "e", Cook wrote both "Hicks" and "Hickes" in different places. The spelling "Hicks" is now in use for the point.

When George Bass sailed past the area at the end of 1797 he did not locate the point. It did not appear on the charts Matthew Flinders made of their voyages, and the name fell into disuse.

The point came to be known as Cape Everard. The first use of that name is said to be by hydrographer John Lort Stokes who surveyed the coast in the "Beagle" in 1843. It is thought he named it after fellow naval officer John Everard Home, but his maps do not use the name.

The first map showing Cape Everard was by surveyor George Douglas Smythe, made in 1852 and published in 1853. If he thought of the name, he may have named it after William Everard, commissioner of crown lands.

The name Cape Everard was used until 1970. There has been doubt and arguments about exactly what Cook saw. The actual latitude and longitude he gave () is a location many miles out to sea.

Point Hicks was renamed as part of Cook's bicentenary. Victorian Premier Henry Bolte announced the new name in a ceremony at the point on 20 April 1970 (this was the 200th anniversary; Cook's 19 April was by nautical time, ie. not adjusted for the International Date Line).

A lighthouse was built on the point in 1887/8 and started operation in 1890. It was built from concrete and with wooden lighthouse keepers houses. It was connected to mains electricity in 1965, and then to solar power recently. The keepers' cottages are today used as holiday houses. With 37 metres of height it is the tallest lighthouse on Australia's mainland. Its light is a double white flash every ten seconds, from a height of 56 metres above sea level.

Thrace

Thrace is a historical and geographic area in southeast Europe.

It occupied a region bounded by the Balkan Mountains on the north, Rhodope Mountains and the Aegean Sea on the south, and by the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara on the east. 

Thrace included areas which are now southeastern Bulgaria, northeastern Greece, and the European part of Turkey. The Thracians were an ancient Indo-European people inhabiting Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe.

The indigenous population of Thrace was a people called the Thracians, divided into numerous tribal groups. 

Thracian troops accompanied neighboring ruler Alexander the Great when he crossed the Hellespont (which abuts Thrace) and took on the Persian Empire of the day. 

Divided into separate tribes, the Thracians did not manage to form a lasting political organization until the Odrysian state was founded in the 4th century BC. Like Illyrians, Thracian tribes of the mountainous regions had a warrior tradition, while the tribes based in the plains were more peaceable. Recent funeral mounds in Bulgaria suggest that Thracian kings did rule regions of Thrace with distinct Thracian national identity. 

Thrace was conquered by Alexander, and later regained its freedom. It was conquered after several attempts by the Romans in 46 , in the reign of Claudius. They became a province, and later four provinces, of the Roman Empire. Finally, as the Empire crumbled, Thrace suffered more than a thousand years of strife and conquest by stronger forces. It never regained its independence.

The Thracians did not describe themselves as such and "Thrace" and "Thracians" are simply the names given them by the Greeks.

Human penis size

Human penis size is described by length and circumference of penis. It is larger than in any other primate. 

The size depends on arousal level, time of day, room temperature, frequency of sexual activity, and unreliability of the measurement methods. Average measurements are applied. The length is measured along the top, from the base to the tip with the man standing and the penis held parallel to the floor. The circumference is measured on erect penis: just below the glans penis, in the middle of the shaft, and at the base. Self-measurements report a higher average length than those which used medical or scientific methods. Doctors induce erection or stretch the flaccid penis as far as possible. Flaccid length is not a reliable indication of erect length. 

The arithmetic mean human penis is approximately in length, the circumference is approximately . There is no scientific relation between either penis size or race, and shoe size or stretched penis size. At birth the penis is between 2.4 and 5.5 cm long, at the beginning of puberty, it is 6 cm. Age does not negatively correlate with penis size.

Ancient Romans admired the large penis of Priapus. Ancient Greek art was not obsessed with penis size. A passage from Aristophanes lists broad shoulders, tiny tongue, strong buttocks, and a little prick as the most desirable masculine features. In medieval Arabic literature, a longer penis was preferred, but Afro-Arab author Al-Jahiz wrote: "If the length of the penis were a sign of honor, then the mule would belong to the (honorable tribe of) Quraysh". 

Males may quite easily underestimate the size of their own penis compared to that of others because of looking down and the accumulation of fat at the base of the penis. Studies found that many men who believed that their penis was of inadequate size had average-sized penises. Sex education of penis measurements was helpful and relieving for men who were concerned about small penis size. 

An Internet survey found only 55% of participating men were satisfied with their penis size, whereas 85% of participating women said they were "very satisfied" with the size of their partner's penis, and only 6% of women rated their partner as smaller than average. A study concluded that penis width rather than length was a more important factor of sexual stimulation probably because a wider penis provides more friction to the clitoral area while a longer penis reaches a less sensitive area. At Utrecht University was found that the majority of homosexual men regarded a large penis as ideal, and having one was linked to self-esteem.

Widespread private concerns have led to a number of folklore sayings and popular culture reflections related to penis size. There is belief that it is possible to predict the size of someone's penis by observing other bodily features such as the hands, feet, nose or height. The media has equated a man's penis size with both power and masculinity. The perception of having a large penis is linked to higher self-esteem.

Most men concerned about their penis size and seeking surgical treatment to enlarge their penis underestimate "normal" penis length.

Many men exaggerate the importance of deep vaginal penetration in stimulating a woman to orgasm. 
The most sensitive area of the female genitals includes the vulva, clitoris, and the section of vagina closest to the outside of a woman's body, which is roughly 10 centimetres in length. The majority of penises are likely of sufficient length to fully satisfy their partners.

Some women find stimulation of the cervix by penis as uncomfortable or painful, others report it to be key to orgasm. The cervix may be confused with the deepest point of the vagina, above and below the cervix, respectively making it possible for there to be indirect and/or simultaneous stimulation between them. During arousal, the vagina lengthens rapidly to an average of about 10 centimetres, but can continue to lengthen in response to pressure. The walls of the vagina are composed of soft elastic folds of mucous membrane skin which stretch or contract (with support from pelvic muscles) to the size of the penis. With proper arousal, the vagina stretches or contracts to accommodate virtually any size penis, from small to large. 

An adult penis with an erect length of less than 7 cm but otherwise formed normally is referred to as having the micropenis condition. Some of the causes are deficiency of pituitary growth hormone and/or gonadotropins, mild degrees of androgen insensitivity, a variety of genetic syndromes, and variations in certain Homeobox genes. Some types of micropenis can be addressed with growth hormone or testosterone treatment in early childhood.

It has been suggested that penis size differences between individuals may also be caused by environmental factors such as culture, diet, chemical/pollution exposure, etc. Endocrine disruptor resulting from chemical exposure has been linked to genital deformation in both sexes (among many other problems). Chemicals from both synthetic (e.g. pesticides, anti-bacterial Triclosan, plasticizers for plastics, etc.) and natural (e.g., chemicals found in tea tree oil and lavender oil)) sources in the blood of pregnant women have been linked to various degrees of endocrine disruption.
Various studies have examined condom breakage, which looked, among other things, at penis size as a factor for breakage or slippage. Although the most common type of condom, those made of latex, have great ability to stretch, they are vulnerable to dry friction (i.e., the dry rubbing motion of sexual activity when there is tight pressure or a lack of smooth lubricated movement) as well as other mistakes of usage. In a separate study of people practicing anal sex, condom breakage was linked more to excessive friction (in this case due to low usage of a sexual lubricant) than to penis size.Penis size did not influence slippage, but penis circumference and broken condoms were strongly correlated, with larger sizes increasing the rate of breakage.

Scantron from Eagan, Minnesota, USA, is a company, that makes and sells machine-readable papers on which students mark answers to test questions, the machines to check those answers, survey and test scoring systems, systems for school attendance (with a mark meaning an missing student) and image-based data collection software and scanners.

A Scantron test scoring system is a multiple-choice, fill-in-the-bubble form. It can have different length and width, from one column, 15-answer tests, to several 8.5×11-inch pages used in standardized testing, such as the SAT and the ACT.

Students use Number 2 pencils to fill in bubbles on the Scantron paper. The papers are put into a scanner which reads the answers and finds out the score. The score tells the teacher how well the student did on the test. 

A problem with the system is that if a student skips a line (for example marking question 18's answer in space 19), the remaining answers will be in the wrong spaces, and are likely to be marked wrong. Usually the student catches this.

A Chickpea is a yellow edible vegetable which can be used for cooking. The peas can be bought canned or dried. It is also one of the earliest vegetables to be grown. The first chickpea was grown in the Middle East about 7,500 years ago. The most popular place for chickpeas to grow is in India. In 2008, nearly 6 million tonnes of chickpeas were produced there. Because the growth is so popular there, it is also known as the Indian pea. Chickpeas contain zinc, protein and folic acid.

<doc id="246870" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246870" title="Vetus Latina">
Vetus Latina

Vetus Latina is the name given to a collection of Biblical texts that were translated into Latin before the Vulgate became the standard version used in the Latin-speaking world. The texts themselves are written in Late Latin, not in Old Latin. They often use different words than the Vulgate. No complete manuscript survives, only fragments are known. Many text passages are known because Church fathers such as Augustine of Hippo cited from them. 

Since the Council of Trent, held in the 16th century, the Vulgate is the official Bible translation for the Roman Catholic Church. 

Some of the Vetus Latin texts survives in the Liturgy, however:
The Old Latin text means, "Glory [belongs] to God among the high, and peace [belongs] to men of good will on earth". The Vulgate text means "Glory [belongs] to God among the most high and peace among men of good will on earth".

Probably the best known difference between the Old Latin and the Vulgate is in the Pater Noster, where the phrase from the Vetus Latina, "quotidianum panem", "daily bread", becomes "supersubstantialem panem", "supersubstantial bread" in the Vulgate.

<doc id="246926" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246926" title="Historical rankings of U.S. Presidents">
Historical rankings of U.S. Presidents

Historians (and sometimes political scientists) are surveyed and asked to give them number ratings on their overall performance or on different aspects of their leadership.

Several different factors are considered in deciding what makes one a good or bad president. These include their character, their vision for the country, their relations with congress, their relations with foreign leaders (diplomacy), how they managed the economy, how they managed the military, and their overall political skill.

To make sure the rankings are fair, many surveys equally balance the opinions of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans.

It is sometimes difficult to accurately rank a president because all of the presidents faced completely different challenges and lived in different times.

Historical opinions of U.S. presidents often change over time. For example, Harry Truman had very low approval ratings right after he left office, but many historians now consider him among the greatest presidents.


Most surveys agree that the top three presidents are:

The following presidents are usually ranked highly:

Some presidents have mixed ratings. For example, Andrew Jackson is considered to be a leader who stood for the common man, but at the same time historians criticize him because of the Indian Removal Act.

Jimmy Carter, Chester Arthur, William Howard Taft, Benjamin Harrison, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Rutherford B. Hayes, Martin Van Buren, and Richard Nixon are considered to be below average.

John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, and James Buchanan are often considered to be among the worst because they failed to prevent the growth of the slavery which resulted in the Civil War. 

Andrew Johnson is often ranked among the worst because he was against the Reconstruction.

Warren G. Harding and Ulysses Grant are often considered to be among the worst presidents because they both made the mistake of appointing their corrupt friends into high political offices, although recently Ulysses Grant has moved up in the rankings because of his efforts to give civil rights to African Americans.

Both historian polls and popular opinion polls consider George W. Bush among the worst U.S. presidents, although some would argue that it is too early to rank him because his term ended recently in 2009.

William Henry Harrison and James Garfield are often not ranked because they both died shortly after becoming presidents. 

Also, Barack Obama is not ranked because his presidency has not ended yet. For the same reason, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton are not ranked in some polls because there presidencies ended within the last ten years.

<doc id="246929" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246929" title="Reconstruction of the United States">
Reconstruction of the United States

The Reconstruction was after the American Civil War. It was the remaking of the South, after it had lost its war of rebellion and slavery was ended. Andrew Johnson became President of the U.S. after Lincoln's assassination in 1865. He wanted to make it easy to restore local rule in the previously rebellious states, and he permitted some of them to hold elections in 1865. Former Confederate leaders who ran as Democrats were re-elected to Congress, and states passed laws that denied rights to former slaves. Many members of the Republican Party wanted stricter terms before local rule was returned to the South. After the Republicans won a large majority of Congressional seats in the 1866 elections, they refused to let former Confederate leaders take seats in the Congress. The Republicans then passed laws that former leaders of the rebellion were not allowed to hold office and were not allowed to vote. Three amendments to the U.S. Constitution were passed -- ending slavery, making former slaves citizens, and giving them the right to vote. Some newly freed black slaves won elected offices. After Reconstruction was ended in 1877, white people in the South used their regained political powers to pass Jim Crow Laws. These laws enforced segregation (keeping blacks and whites separate) and took the vote away from black people whose parents or grandparents were slaves. The Ku Klux Klan was also formed to keep black people from having any kind of political and economic power. After Reconstruction, white Southerners voted mostly against the Republican Party for about 80 years.

Troodontidae

Troodontidae is a family of bird-like theropod dinosaurs. They were found mainly in Mongolia, China and North America. The first specimen, just a single tooth, was found in central Montana in 1855 by Ferdinand Hayden. The family are known for their large brains, a skull with many air pockets, a retractable second toe claw (it could be pulled in) and many teeth. The number of teeth ranges from 96 in "Saurornithoides mongoliensis" to 120 in the "Troodon".

During most of the 20th century, troodontid fossils were few and scrappy and they have therefore been linked, at various times, with many dinosaurian lineages. More recent fossil discoveries of complete and articulated specimens (including specimens which preserve feathers, eggs and embryos, and complete juveniles), have helped to increase understanding about this group. In 1994 a fossil of an adult "Troodon" was found sitting on a nest with eight eggs.

Anatomical studies, particularly studies of the most primitive troodontids, like "Sinovenator", demonstrate striking anatomical similarities with "Archaeopteryx" and primitive dromaeosaurs, and demonstrate that they are relatives. The clade is called 'Paraves'.

Sinovenator

Sinovenator (meaning "Chinese - hunter", derived from the Latin word "venator" = hunter and the Greek word "Σινάι" = China, Chinese) is a genus of troodontid dinosaur from China. It is from the early Cretaceous Period. Two fossils were found in the older (lower) portion of the Yixian Formation in China, 128.2 million years ago (Ma) during the Barremian age. The type specimen, "Sinovenator changii", was described by Xu, Norell, Wang, Makovicky and Wu in 2002. The type specimen is IVPP 12615, a partial skull and disarticulated skeleton. A referred specimen is IVPP 12583, an incomplete but articulated postcranial skeleton. Both are in the collection of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, China. 

"Sinovenator" was a basal troodontid. "Sinovenator" shares features with the most primitive dromaeosaurids and Avialae, demonstrating the common inheritance of these three members of the Paraves. "Sinovenator" was about the size of a chicken.

Paraves

Paraves is a branch-based clade containing birds (clade Aves) and other closely related dinosaurs. The paravians include the Avialae, such as "Archaeopteryx", and the Deinonychosauria, which includes the dromaeosaurids and troodontids.

The name Paraves was coined by Paul Sereno in 1997. The clade was defined by Sereno in 1998 as a branch-based clade containing all Maniraptora closer to modern birds than to "Oviraptor".

The work of Xu and colleagues provide examples of basal and early paravians with four wings, including members of the Avialae ("Pedopenna"), Dromaeosauridae ("Microraptor"), and Troodontidae ("Anchiornis").

The cladogram presented below follows a study by Zhang and colleagues.

Stan is the nickname given to a fossil of the dinosaur species "Tyrannosaurus rex". It was found in Hell Creek Formation, South Dakota, close to Buffalo in 1987 by Stan Sacrison, who also discovered the "Tyrannosaurus" specimen nicknamed "Duffy". The original specimen is housed at the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research. 

It is a well known specimen, and one of the most complete, with 199 bones recovered. About 30 casts of the original fossil has been sold worldwide, each for a price of about $100 000. Stan measures 40.1 feet long, and 12 feet over the hips.

Persuasion (novel)

Persuasion is Jane Austen's last finished novel. 

"Persuasion" is the story of a second chance of lost love. Anne Elliot is the second daughter of Sir Walter Elliot, a proud and foolish baronet. Sir Walter Elliot is a widower with no son, so his land will go to a cousin, William Elliot. Eight years before the story begins, Anne had been engaged to a young naval officer, Frederick Wentworth. However, her mother's friend Lady Russell had her to break off the engagement because he had no fortune. Sadly, she had done so, and Wentworth had angrily left her. Austen writes: "She had been forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older–the natural sequel (following) of an unnatural beginning." Later, Cassandra Austen wrote beside it in her copy of "Persuasion", "Dear, dear Jane! This deserves to be written in letters of gold." Eight years later, her younger sister Mary has married a neighbor, Charles Musgrove. Anne is growing older, her family does not care about her, and she greatly regrets breaking off the engagement.

Sir Walter is forced to stop spending so much money. Therefore, he decides to let his house to Admiral Croft and move to Bath for a while. Anne goes to stay with Mary. Anne discovers that Mrs. Croft, Admiral Croft's wife, is Captain Wentworth's sister. He is introduced to the Musgrove family. He has made much money, and is now a very desirable husband. When he and Anne meet, Anne feels deeply unhappy. He does not seem to care any more about her. He with the two Musgrove sisters. Most think that he will marry one of them.

They all go to visit Lyme Regis, where Wentworth's friend Captain Harville is staying. Captain Harville had been mourning for his sister, who died young, and comforting Captain Benwick, who had been engaged to marry her. In Lyme, Louisa Musgrove falls from the Cobb while playing with Captain Wentworth on the steps and is seriously injured. Captain Wentworth feels very guilty, and realizes everyone thinks he will marry her if she becomes well again.

Anne joins her father and sister in Bath. They are both being by a widow, Mrs. Clay, the daughter of their family lawyer. William Elliot joins the family. Lady Russell encourages his attentions to Anne, but Anne feels unsure about him. Suddenly, news comes that Louisa is better, and that she and Benwick are engaged. Wentworth appears in Bath, and becomes jealous of Mr. Elliot. She learns from an old friend that Mr. Elliot is a bad person. When Wentworth asks Anne to marry him again, she joyously says yes.

Praetorian Guard

The Praetorian Guard was a force of bodyguards used by Roman Emperors. The title was first used for the guards of generals in the Roman Republic. Their commander, the Praetorian Prefect, was often an important figure in the political scheming in Rome. The Guard was dissolved by Emperor Constantine I in the fourth century AD.

The term "Praetorian" derived from the tent of the commanding general or praetor of a Roman army in the field—the "praetorium". It was a habit of many Roman generals to choose from the ranks a private force of soldiers to act as guards of their person. This elite group of Roman citizens consisted of both infantry and cavalry. In time, this cohort came to be known as the "cohors praetoria", and various notable figures possessed one, including Julius Caesar, Mark Antony and Augustus (Octavian). 

As Caesar discovered with the 10th Legion "Equestris", a powerful mounted unit was desirable in the field. When Augustus became the first ruler of the Roman Empire in 27 BC, he decided such a formation was useful not only on the battlefield but in politics also. Thus, from the ranks of the legions throughout the provinces, Augustus recruited the Praetorian Guard. 

Through the cunning of their ambitious prefect, Sejanus, the Guard was brought from their Italian barracks into Rome itself. In 23, Sejanus convinced Tiberius to have the Praetorian fort built just outside Rome. One of the cohorts held the daily guard at the imperial palace. Henceforth the entire Guard was at the disposal of the emperors, but the rulers were now equally at the mercy of the Praetorians. The reality of this was seen in 31 when Tiberius was forced to rely upon his own "cohors praetoria" against partisans of Sejanus. Although the Praetorian Guard proved faithful to the aging Tiberius, their potential political power had been made clear.

While campaigning, the Praetorians were the equal of any formation in the Roman Army. Seldom used in the early reigns, they were quite active by 69. Under Domitian and Trajan, the guard took part in wars from Dacia to Mesopotamia, while with Marcus Aurelius, years were spent on the Danube frontier. Throughout the 3rd century, the Praetorians assisted the emperors in various campaigns.

The relationship between the Guard and their Emperor was always sensitive. Bribing the Guard is a common theme in Imperial history. Sejanus almost took over the running of the Empire, before Tiberius overcame, and later executed him. A number of Emperors were murdered or otherwise deposed by the Guard, or with their knowledge. The first was Caligula.

Waiting for Guffman

Waiting for Guffman is a musical mockumentary movie made in 1997. It was directed by Christopher Guest, who also stars in the movie. The movie is set in the small town of Blaine, Missouri, which is not a real town. The town decides to perform a musical called "Red, White and Blaine" to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the town, and invites a famous theater critic named Guffman to see it, hoping that he will make the play famous.

The name of the movie is a reference to the play "Waiting for Godot" by Samuel Beckett. In that play, the two main characters are waiting for a man named Godot, who never shows up. In "Waiting for Guffman", Guffman never shows up, either.

Ant mill

An ant mill is a small group of army ants away from the other ants. They lose the pheromone track and begin to follow each other, making a spinning circle. The ants will die of exhaustion. People can make this happen easily. This is a side effect of the self organizing structure of ant colonies. Each ant only knows to follow the ant in front of it. This will work until something goes wrong and an ant mill forms. An ant mill was first seen by William Beebe who saw a mill 1,200 feet in circumference. It took each ant 2.5 hours to go around.

A lady-in-waiting (also called waiting maid) is a female personal helper at a noble court. She helps a queen, a princess or other noblewoman. A lady-in-waiting is often a noblewoman of lower rank than the one she attends to. She is not thought of as a servant. Their duties were different depending on the court. People with artistic talents were usually chosen. In Russia, girls between "fourteen or twenty ["sic"]" were chosen, and left the court when she married. People like Anne Boelyn, Jane Seymour, Catherine Howard, and Katherine Parr were all ladies-in-waiting.

Medical microbiology

Medical microbiology, also known as ‘’’clinical microbiology’’’, is the study of microbes, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, which cause a human illness and their role in the disease. 

The microbes and the branch of microbiology are the most studied due to their great importance to medicine. 

Medical microbiology studies development and progress of the infectious disease in a patient and in human population (epidemiology). It is related to the study of disease pathology and immunology. It is a branch of medicine and microbiology and includes five sciences: bacteriology, virology, parasitology, immunology and mycology. 

In 1546, Girolamo Fracastoro proposed that epidemic diseases were caused by transferable seed like entities through direct, indirect contact and contact over long distances with an infection. 

Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch are the founders of medical microbiology. Louis Pasteur is famous for his experiments when he disproved the theory of spontaneous generation.. He offered method for food preservation (pasteurization) and vaccines against anthrax, fowl cholera and rabies. Robert Koch contributed to the germ theory of disease, provided that specific diseases were caused by specific microbes. He developed criteria known as the Koch's postulates and was among first to isolate bacteria in pure culture resulting in his description of several bacteria including "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", the causative agent of tuberculosis.





A medical microbiologist is a specialist in medical (clinical) microbiology. 

He provides clinical consultations on the investigation, diagnosis, and treatment of patients suffering from infectious diseases. He establishes and directs infection control programs across public health care, infectious disease prevention and epidemiology. 

He provides the scientific and administrative direction of a clinical microbiology laboratory. Such laboratory receives almost any clinical specimen, including swabs, feces, urine, blood, sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, possible infected tissue. The work here is mainly concerned with cultures, to look for suspected pathogens which, if found, are identified based on biochemical tests. In addition, sensitivity testing is carried out to determine whether the pathogen is sensitive or resistant to a suggested medicine. Results are reported with the identified organism(s) and the type and amount of drug(s) that should be prescribed for the patient.

Medical microbiologist is also involved in teaching at all levels, and in research. It provided the development of vaccines against invading organisms. Deadly and debilitating diseases such as small pox, polio, and tuberculosis have been either eradicated or become more treatable.
There are claims that consuming probiotics (bacteria potentially beneficial to the digestive system) and/or prebiotics (substances consumed to promote the growth of probiotic microorganisms) contributes to human health. Microorganisms could be useful in the treatment of cancer. Strains of non-pathogenic clostridia can infiltrate and replicate within solid tumors, deliver therapeutic proteins.

Traditionally, Classicism is about the art made in antiquity (very long ago, in ancient times) or to later art inspired by that of antiquity. But Neoclassicism is always about the art made later but inspired by antiquity. So, Classicism and Neoclassicism are often used together. It often means clearness, elegance, harmony, and rest made by careful attention to traditional forms.

Robert Todd Lincoln

Robert Todd Lincoln (August 1, 1843 – July 26, 1926) was an American lawyer and Secretary of War. He was the first son of President Abraham Lincoln and his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln. Born in Springfield, Illinois, United States, he was the only one of Lincoln's four sons to live to be an adult. He was a bright lawyer, and mostly served railroad interests. He was (1897–1911) president of the Pullman Company. He was quiet and shy. Because of this, he never tried to be a president, but he was minister to Great Britain (1889–93). Most of his last 20 years were spent at Hildene, his estate near Manchester, Vermont.

Lincoln did not have a very close relationship with his father. This was partly because Abraham Lincoln often spent months away from home. Robert would later say his clearest memory of his father was when he was packing for a trip to Illinois. Abraham Lincoln was proud of Robert. He thought Robert was clever. Though they were not close, Robert respected and loved his father. He wept openly at his deathbed. 

Following his father's assassination, in April 1865, Robert Lincoln moved with his mother and his brother Tad to Chicago, where Robert completed his law studies at the Old University of Chicago (a school different from but later assumed by the university presently known by that name). He was admitted to the bar on February 25, 1867.

On September 24, 1868, Robert Lincoln married Mary Eunice Harlan (September 25, 1846 – March 31, 1937). They had two daughters and one son. The last person who was directly related to Lincoln was Robert's grandson "Bud" Beckwith. He died in 1985.

Sejanus

Sejanus (Lucius Aelius Seianus 20 BC – October 18, AD 31), was an ambitious soldier, friend and confidant of the Roman Emperor Tiberius. An equestrian by birth, Sejanus rose to power as Praetorian Prefect. He commanded the Roman imperial bodyguard, the Praetorian Guard, from AD 14 until his death in 31.

After the Praetorian Guard was established under Augustus, Sejanus introduced reforms which saw the unit go from a mere bodyguard to an influential branch of the government. It controlled public security, and influenced civil administration. Most important of all, it influenced the succession of emperors: all needed the goodwill and support of the Guard. These changes would have a lasting impact on the Empire.

During the 20s, Sejanus gradually accumulated power by influencing Tiberius and eliminating potential political opponents, including the emperor's son, Drusus. When Tiberius withdrew to Capri in 26, Sejanus was left in control of the entire state mechanism as "de facto" ruler of the empire. For a time the most influential and feared citizen of Rome, Sejanus suddenly fell from power in 31, the year his career culminated with the consulship. Amidst suspicions of conspiracy against Tiberius, Sejanus was arrested and executed, along with his followers.

In 29 Sejanus began a series of purge trials of senators and wealthy equestrians in the city, removing those capable of opposing his power, adding to the imperial (and his own) treasury. Networks of spies and informers brought the victims to trial with false accusations of treason, and many chose suicide over the disgrace of being condemned and executed. Only Caligula, the last remaining son of Germanicus, managed to survive the purges of Sejanus. He had moved to Capri to be with Tiberius in 31.

Through years of crafty intrigues and indispensable service to the emperor, Sejanus had worked himself up to become the most powerful man in the empire. Exactly what caused his sudden downfall is unclear: According to Josephus, it was Antonia, the mother of Livilla, who finally alerted Tiberius to the growing threat Sejanus posed. She sent a letter to Capri in the care of her freedman Pallas.

By the end of 31, he would be arrested, summarily executed and his body unceremoniously cast down. Tiberius resigned his post of Consul, which forced Sejanus to do likewise. This removed much of Sejanus' legal powers and protection. Another man, Macro, was appointed as Praetorian Prefect. Sejanus was summoned to a meeting of the Senate, where a letter from Tiberius was read condemning Sejanus and ordering his immediate execution. 
Following an issue of "damnatio memoriae" by the Senate, his statues were torn down and his name obliterated from public records. Although Rome at first rejoiced at the death of Sejanus, the city quickly plunged into more extensive trials, as Tiberius relentlessly persecuted all those who could in any way be tied to the schemes of Sejanus or had courted his friendship. This included all the children of Sejanus.

Al Jolson

Al Jolson (May 26, 1886 – October 23, 1950) was an American singer, comedian, and actor. His career lasted from 1911 until his death in 1950. He was called "the world's greatest entertainer”. 

His singing style was "sentimental [and] melodramatic". This style made many songs popular. Jolson influenced many famous singers. Some of these singers were Bing Crosby Judy Garland, rock and country entertainer Jerry Lee Lewis, and Bob Dylan. Dylan said Jolson was "somebody whose life I can feel".

Jolson was America's most famous and highest paid entertainer in the 1930s. Jolson sang and acted in the first (full length) talking movie, "The Jazz Singer" in 1927. He starred in many other musical movies in the 1930s. A movie about Jolson's life, "The Jolson Story", won Oscars in 1946. Larry Parks played Jolson, but Jolson sang the songs himself. A sequel, "Jolson Sings Again," was released in 1949, and was nominated for three Oscars. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Jolson became the first star to entertain troops overseas during World War II. Again in 1950 became the first star to perform for GIs in Korea. He did 42 shows in 16 days.

He sometimes performed in blackface makeup. This was a theatrical convention in the mid-19th century. With his unique and dynamic style of singing black music, like jazz and blues, he was later credited with single-handedly introducing African-American music to white audiences. As early as 1911 he became known for fighting against anti-black discrimination on Broadway. Jolson's well-known theatrics and his promotion of equality on Broadway helped pave the way for many black performers, playwrights, and songwriters, including Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Fats Waller, and Ethel Waters.

Zhytomyr

Zhytomyr () is a city in Ukraine, the administrative center of Zhytomyr oblast. Nearly 271 000 people live here ().

Zhytomyr is a big transportation center. The city lies on a historic way that connects the city of Kiev with the west through Brest. Today it connects Warsaw with Kiev, Minsk with Izmail, and several major cities of Ukraine. Zhytomyr was also the location of Ozerne, an important Cold War strategic plane base that was situated southeast of the city.

Zhytomyr is divided into two districts. It is located on the Teteriv River.

As a legend says, Zhytomyr was founded about 884 by Zhytomyr, prince of a Slavic tribe of Drevlians. This date, 884, is cut in the large stone of the ice age times, that stands on the hill where it was founded.

<doc id="247203" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=247203" title="Media center">
Media center

The term media center refers either to a dedicated computer appliance or to a specialized application software designed to run on standard personal computer hardware which then becomes a so called ""HTPC"" (""Home Theater PC"", also sometimes referred to as a ""Media PC""), both of which are adapted for playing various kinds of media (music, movies, photos etc.). A media center usually has a GUI (Graphical User Interface) designed to be used with a living-room TV using a remote control. This remote control is commonly known by their designers as a 10-foot user interface. A media center typically allows one to watch movies (DVD, BluRay, and other digital video formats) and watching and recording television broadcasts, playing audio (CD as well as MP3, WMA, and other audio formats).

The media itself may be stored, received by terrestrial, satellite or cable broadcasting or streamed from the internet. Stored media is kept either on a local hard drive or on a (wireless) network attached storage. Some software is capable of doing other tasks, such as finding news (RSS) from the Internet. Media centers are often operated with a remote control, connected to a television set for video output, and can sometimes function as a normal personal computer.

A media center can be purpose-built, modified or created individuals by adding media center software to a PC or some other computer, for example a Home Theater PC or an Xbox. Lately, some video game consoles (such as PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360) with their network services can also act as a basic media center device by default.

Typically, complete media centers offer the following functions to the user:


Though media centers are often built using similar components to personal computers, they are often smaller; media centers sometimes have hardware that is not usually seen in personal computers, such as receivers for remote controls, or television tuner cards. Media centers have not seen widespread popularity but are starting to take hold in the UK and the United States.

There are several common applications for which media centers are beginning to gain popularity. Simply put, any application requiring the playback of digital media based files, but not requiring the full features and flexibility of a personal computer stands to benefit from the reduced size, reduced complexity and reduced cost of media centers when compared to similarly equipped PCs.

Common applications include :

Doctor-patient relationship

The relationship between a doctor and a patient is a very important part of medicine. Only when there is a good relationship between the two is it possible to have high-quality healthcare. This relationship is also at the base of medical ethics. Many medical schools teach the doctors to be to keep a professional relationship with their patients, to respect the patients' dignity and privacy. 

This relationship has asymmetric information though. The doctor knows more than the patient, but has to explain the patient's situation, and has to ask the patient what treatments should be done. There is a very similar relationship between the patient and nurses, psychologists.

There are different legal norms that regulate this relationship. Examples of such norms are the Hippocratic oath, the Declaration of Geneva. Professional responsibility may also govern such a relationship.

Ideally, patient and doctor trust each other. If they do, this can have a positive influence on the development of disease or condition. Healing can be hindered if the patient does not take the prescribed drugs, of if these drugs are not taken in the doses prescribed.

If the relationship is too good this can preclude efficiency. In certain cases, it may be good to get the opinion of a second doctor, regarding a condition.

Army ant

Army ant (or legionary ant or "Marabunta") means over 200 ant species. They are called army ants due to their aggressive predatory groups looking for food, known as "raids", in which many ants look for food at the same time in one place, attacking other animals "en masse".

Most ant species make homes where they always live. Army ants do not. They keep moving. All army ant species are members of the ant family, Formicidae, but there are several kinds that have evolved on their own the same behavior. This is called "legionary behavior", and is convergent evolution.

Before, "army ant" meant ants from 5 different ant subfamilies: in two of these subfamilies, the Ponerinae and Myrmicinae, it is only a few species that show legionary behavior; in the other three subfamilies, Ecitoninae, Dorylinae, and Leptanillinae, "all" of the species are legionary. Now, another subfamily Leptanilloidinae, is called army ants.

A 2003 study of thirty species (by Sean Brady of Cornell University) shows that the ecitonine and doryline army ants evolved from one group in the mid-Cretaceous period in Gondwana, and so the two subfamilies are now one called Ecitoninae, but not everyone says this.

These are army ants:

Commutative property

The commutative property of addition and multiplication tells us that it does not matter which number we add first, or multiply first. We will still get the same answer if we add them backwards. The same thing goes for multiplying backwards.

The definition of commutative property of addition is, when we substitute any number for "a" and "b", formula_1.

For example, formula_2, because formula_3 and formula_4 are both formula_5. It doesn't matter whether the formula_6 or the formula_7 comes first. 2+3=3+2 is the same as formula_1, when formula_9 and formula_10.
We can substitute fractions too. formula_11. Either way, it adds to formula_12.

And for good mathematicians, we can substitute irrational numbers as well: formula_13.

Some operations like dividing are not commutative. For instance, 6 divided by 3 is 2, but 3 divided by 6 is 1/2. Do not divide backwards. Dividing is not commutative. Subtracting is not commutative either. But in higher mathematics, there are other commutative operations besides adding and multiplying.

Irrational number

An irrational number is defined to be any number that is the part of the real number system that cannot be written as a complete ratio of two integers.

An irrational number cannot be fully written down in decimal form. It would have an infinite number of digits after the decimal point. These digits would also not repeat.
Irrational numbers often occur in geometry. For instance, if we have a square which has sides of 1 meter, the distance between opposite corners is the square root of two meters. This is an irrational number. In decimal for it is written as 1.414213... Mathematicians have proved that the square root of every natural number is either an integer or an irrational number.

One well known irrational number is pi. This is the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter. This number is the same for every circle. The number pi is approximately 3.1415926359... .

The Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway (the O.I.R.) was a standard gauge railway that served an ironstone quarry near the village of Wroxton in Oxfordshire. It linked to the Great Western Railway about to the east, just north of the town of Banbury. Both the quarry and line opened in 1917 and closed in 1967, when the Ironstone ran out. It never became part of British Rail and was run by the quarry's owners.

The quarry was heavily worked in the Second World War, due to extra war needs. A newer quarry close by is now served by trucks only. 

The OIR operated its own fleet of steam locomotives: 0-6-0T, 0-6-0ST and 0-4-0ST's.

In 2002 Lee declared his candidacy for Seoul Mayor, and won the election. After he became president, he said, "I will give Seoul a complete makeover." He became the present President of South Korea on 19 December 2007. This was the same day as his birthday. It was also the same day he married his wife, Kim Yoon-ok. So, on their 37th wedding anniversary and his 67th birthday, Lee became President of South Korea. Lee has three daughters and one son.

Lee Myung-bak was born on December 19, 1941 in Japan. After the end of World War II in 1945, his family came back to his father's hometown Pohang, Gyeongsangbuk-do, South Korea. Lee went to night school at Dongji Commercial High School.

On March 26, 2010 an explosion destroyed the South Korean warship Cheonan. This killed 40 men. Six men also disappeared. They are thought to be dead. An investigation into the sinking blamed North Korea. They said that a torpedo fired by a North Korean submarine had sunk the ship. North Korea said it had nothing to do with the Cheonan's sinking. They said they were not guilty. Lee said their denial was "laughable". He stopped all trade between the north and south. He also asked the United Nations to help them against North Korea. He also began sending radio messages to North Korean people.

Lee Myung-bak is a Christian and goes to the Somang Presbyterian church. When he was a mayor, he once declared that Seoul was a "holy place governed by God". He has been much criticized for his beliefs. Buddhist people protested that Lee was a threat to their religion.

Lee has also been criticized for not giving enough political freedom to the people. For example, the police limited demonstrations. But Lee said, "I fully understand the protestors' point of view on the matter". He added, "Protesting culture has a deep root in democracy of Korea and despite the ongoing political upheaval of this country, the enthusiasm that the protesters showed is one embrace (approve) and this a positive (good) drive of Korea's development."

The team was founded as Fußball-Klub Alemania Augsburg in 1907 and played as BC Augsburg from 1921 to 1969. The merging of the clubs TSV Schwaben and BC Augsburg was discussed since the late 1940s. In 1969 BC Augsburg had problems in the 3rd division and so had TSV Schwaben. The new FCA played its first game on 30 July 1969, when it met 1. FC Nuremberg in Augsburg in front of 13,000 and lost 3-0 in extra time.

After the formation of the club in 1969, the club played mostly in the 2nd and 3rd division of German football.From 1983 to 1994 they played in Bavaria's highest league, the Bayernliga. At this time it was the third division of league football in Germany. From 194 to 2000 they played in the Regionalliga Süd which was the name of the new 3rd stage of German league system. In 2006/07 they played for the first time in the 2.Bundesliga and in the 2010/11 season they reached the second place. They were promoted to the German Bundesliga.

Phonon

In physics, a phonon is a quantized lattice vibration. The word quantized is used in physics to mean that only certain values of something are allowed. Something that is quantized can be thought of as stairs; you can only move from step to step and you can't stand in between steps. Something that is not quantized can be thought of as a ramp or smooth incline; you can move any distance up or down. A lattice is the repeating or periodic structure of a crystal. A crystal is made up of atoms or molecules in a certain pattern. The points on the pattern at which the atoms or molecules are located is the lattice. Solids, liquids, and gases can all experience vibrations. A vibration being quantized means that only certain frequencies of vibrations are allowed.

Intuitively, there is no reason for lattice vibrations to be quantized. The macroscopic or large-scale vibrations of a material are not quantized and can take on essentially any frequency. It is only when we consider the tiny vibrations of the particles that make up a material—atoms and molecules—that the concept of quantization and phonons becomes important. To understand why phonons exist, complicated quantum mechanics is needed. Without going into too much detail, the interactions between the constituent atoms or molecules of a crystal are analyzed quantum mechanically. Because of their arrangement in a pattern that repeats, when one arrives at a mathematical expression for the frequency of oscillation, one finds that there are only distinct quantized values allowed. There is unfortunately no simple way to explain this.

The Thunder Bay Thunder Cats was the name of the Rockford IceHogs of the UHL (now the International Hockey League) prior to moving to Rockford. The team went through a number of different names prior to being the Thunder Cats, including the Thunder Bay Thunder Hawks and the Thunder Bay Senators.

After the success of the 5-time Allan Cup champion Thunder Bay Twins, the Colonial Hockey League took interest in expanding to the Northwestern Ontario city. In 1991, the Colonial league introduced the Thunder Bay Thunder Hawks, spelling the end of the 21-year Twins franchise that stepped aside for the new Semi-Pro team. In 1993, the team changed its name to the Thunder Bay Senators to reflect the teams affiliation with the National Hockey League's Ottawa Senators. Soon after, the CoHL changed its name to the United Hockey League and in 1996 the team became the Thunder Bay Thunder Cats.

After eight seasons in Thunder Bay, the Thunder Cats were bought, moved to Rockford, Illinois, and renamed the Rockford IceHogs in 1999.

Lymington Branch Line

The Lymington branch line is a short line running between Brockenhurst and Lymington Pier. The line is operated by South West Trains. There is a station in between called Lymington Town. The short length of track between Lymington Town and Lymington Pier has a line speed of 20mph.

The two preserved 421cig units make the line a popluar destination for rail-fans. Unit 1497 "Freshwater" was painted in British Rail White and Blue while 1498 "Farringford" was painted in BR Green. The units were given names of places on the Isle of Wight as they only ran on this line. Until 22 May 22 2010 they were the only EMU slamdoor units still in operation anywhere in Britain.

The line is now operated by 158/9 sprinter units. This means the 750Volt DC electric has no longer got a use. This may seem strange as most parts of the country are electrifiying lines. The reason for this is that "450 units" have 4 cars which are too long for Lymington Town Station. And South West Trains are not willing to remove a coach from a 450 unit. The only solution then is to use DMU 3 car sprinter units.

ELIZA is an early program able to process natural language. ELIZA operated by processing users' responses to "scripts". The most famous script was called DOCTOR. It was a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist. Eliza didn't know much about thought or emotion. However, DOCTOR sometimes provided conversation like a human. ELIZA was written at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 to 1966.

When the person used words that were not in the very small list,
DOCTOR might say, for example, responding to "My head hurts", "Why do you say your head hurts?" The response to "My mother hates me" might be "Who else in your family hates you?" ELIZA was programmed using simple pattern matching techniques, but was taken seriously by several of its users, even after Weizenbaum explained to them how it worked. It was one of the first chatterbots in existence.

GNU Emacs

GNU Emacs (short for Editing Macros) is a text editor that is common on many UNIX-based operating systems.

Emacs is primarily used by programmers.

Emacs is made powerful by Emacs Lisp, a built-in programming language that lets the user extend the capabilities of the editor.

A common Emacs joke is that all of the functions of the editor are crazy weird keystrokes (such as "control-meta-4 shift-left-P-semicolon-F1" to do something simple like cut and paste text). In reality, though, these keystrokes are relatively simple, though they can take some getting used to.

There is an Internet turf war between programmers that prefer Emacs and programmers that prefer Vim (or Vi), another common text editor.

Christadelphians

The Christadelphians are a Christian denomination that developed in the United Kingdom and the United States in the 19th century. Other names for them include Brothers of Christ and Christ's Brethren. They were in effect founded by John Thomas, but do not consider him greater than any other teacher. Today, there are about 55,000-60,000 Christadelphians. Many of them live in Britain, Australia, Africa and the United States. 

Their ideas are close to other Restorationist movements such as the Anabaptist movement. They say that when Christianity came in contact with the Hellenic world, it was spoiled. Therefore, they only accept teachings that can be found in the Bible. They think that the Bible was inspired by God and they accept no other texts. 

Today almost all Christadelphians belong to the main "Central" fellowship. But, following some disagreements, there have been different groups of Christadelphians:


They do not have priests or pastors, instead each local church has a group of elders who are chosen by the members each year. Most male members take turns to speak each week.

Gaza flotilla raid

The Gaza flotilla raid is an event that occurred on 31 May 2010. It was in the international waters of the Mediterranean Sea, when Israeli naval forces seized an aid flotilla of six ships carrying 663 or 682 pro-Palestinian activists from 37 nations, known as the "Gaza Freedom Flotilla". The activists were trying to breach the blockade of Gaza and deliver humanitarian supplies. .
During the event, Israeli military forces seized a convoy of six ships carrying goods which should be brought to the Palestinian territories in the form of aid. There were 663-682 people on board these ships. The ships were headed to the port of Gaza. Israel had offered them to land at a different port, so that the aid could be inspected, but the crew had declined this offer. During the incident, at least nine people were killed. 

The Gaza strip is part of the Palestinian Arab nation of Palestine. It is amongst the most densely populated areas on Earth. About 1.5 million people live on a surface of roughly 493 km².

The Palestinian Authority says that this is an occupied territory. They say, Israel is the occupation force, and it should withdraw, and give the territory back to the Palestinians. Israel has attacked and bombed Gaza several times, most recently during December of 2008.

Israel does not see things this way, since they gave over the territory to Palestinian administration in 2005, and have pulled back their troops over time . Meanwhile, Hamas, the Palestinian group which controls the territory, has launched it's rockets at Israel.

Hamas took over the Gaza Strip since the Fatah–Hamas conflict that was after the 2006 Palestinian elections Israel said Hamas to be a terrorist movement. Likewise, Egypt did not agree with Hamas removeing the Palestinian Authority officials from Gaza. 

The Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip was said to be a safety measure by Israel, but the Free Gaza Movement are opposed. Hamas, along with other groups had been causing trouble there and in southern parts of Israel. The blocked started in 2007. Many countries (like Egypt) feal sorry for the Gaza Strip, a few others (like Iran) hate or some how fear Israel and some (like the USA) agree with Israel.

The Turkish passenger ship Cruse Liner MV Mavi Marmara was trying to take Turkish and Cypriot aid to the Gaza Strip on May the 31st, when the Israeli Navy found it. The 3 year old blockade was upheld by Flotilla 13. The Mavi Marmara was 40 miles from the Gaza Strip when it was raided. 27 British activists, 9 Palestinian, 8 Turks, 2 Irish, 1 Swedish, 1 South African, 1 American and 1 Albanian were on the Mavi Marmara, along with a few others. The Mavi Marmara was followed by the Irish passenger ship MV Rachel Corrie and 4 other minor vessels. The ships carried a total of 663-682 activists and aid workers , including several Turks, several Malaysians another American, a Australian, a and a Belgian.

There were in total 663 or 683 people from 37 nations on board the 6 ships in the civilian flotilla. Notable people aboard the flotilla included Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Corrigan, former UN Assistant Secretary-General Denis Halliday, Israeli-Arab member of Knesset Haneen Zoubi, leader of the northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel Raed Salah, Swedish novelist Henning Mankell, and a number of politicians from European and Arab national governments and the European Parliament.

Israel said that the other 5 ships were boarded and taken over peacefully, and that the only incidents took place in the "Mavi Marmara", but many reports that several people from the other ships were also wounded.

The flotilla had planned to break through the Gaza blockade, ignoring Israel's plan for the activists to stop at the port of Ashdod and transfer the cargo through there. After the flotilla's activists ignored repeated calls to give in, so soldiers from the Shayetet 13 (Flotilla 13) unit boarded the ships at around 04:00 IST

The convoy organizers Arafat Shoukriof, of the Free Gaza Movement (FGM), denied the account of Israeli military. One of the co-organizers of the flotilla convoy, said those on board one ship had called them by telephone to say that Israeli helicopters had arrived to do a surprise raid. 

The boarding of the "Mavi Marmara" resulted in violent clashes between activists and Israeli soldiers, though the details are disputed. 

Apparently an Israeli helicopter dropped 30 specialist soldiers on to the ship. Fighting then broke out for an unknown reason. An Israeli trooper was thrown over the side of the ship, some aid workers rioted and threw chairs at the Israelis. The Israelis then used tear gas, tassers, stun grenades and smoke bombs to stop the trouble . Later several gun shots were fired by both sides. Finally, at the end of it all, an Albanian woman fell over the side of the ship. The soldiers, who used stun grenades, then asked for government permission to use their firearms, which they then received.

The Israeli military said that the troops were suddenly attacked after climbing down roapes from helicopters onto the deck of the ship. Soldiers were reportedly beaten badly, one was stabbed, and one was thrown in to the sea Two Israelis had their guns taken away. An Israeli commando said that there was live fire at some point against them from below deck. Stun grenades and tear gas were used in an attempt to disperse activists. After this proved ineffective, the commandos requested and received permission to use shoot the resisting activists. The commandos then shot activists in the legs, which forced them to disperse. The commandos reached the bridge and took over the ship after 30 minutes. Some fighting can be seen in videos released by the Israeli military and Free Gaza activists. The Israeli military released 20 videos of the incident,
According to Major Avital Leibovich of the IDF Spokesperson's Unit, the activists attacked the soldiers with knives, slingshots, spikes, and clubs, and with pistols that were found by the Israeli troops. Adam Shapiro, a board member of the Free Gaza Movement, said that according to the Al Jazeera correspondents on the ship, the soldiers started opening fire immediately as they came down the ropes.

The wife of the Mavi Marmara captain, Nilüfer Ören, stated that IDF began tracking them after , there were 40 Israeli ships following and snooping on the convoy until the troopers were boarding the ships from helicopters at 04:45 am. She also said that stun grenades and smoke bombs were used. Therefore activists and crewmembers used gasmasks. Norman Paech, a former member of the German parliament Left Party who was aboard the Mavi Marmara said he only saw three activists resisting on his part of the boat and said "They had no knives, no axes, only sticks that they used to defend themselves."

Reporters for Iranian TV and Al Jazeera TV news told of the use of tear gas/CS gas and stun grenades. The Israeli solders said that the activists wore gas masks and ski masks. Neither side were fully believed by the United Nations, who tried not to take sides.

The MV Rachel Corrie gave in and hoisted the white flag of truce when boarded by the Israeli navy.

The ship Challenger One sped up along its course in an attempt to allow journalists to take their photos of the ongoing raid. Huwaida Arraf, an American activist who was on the "Challenger One" reported that Israeli soldiers attacked any one who tried to block them from taking over the vessel with kicks, tasers, and stun grenades.

Activist Huwaida Arraf reported that once onboard the Challenger One, Israeli troops seized all communication equipment, cameras, mobile phones, radios and memory cards from activists.

Former UK diplomat Ed Peck, who was on board the ship Sfendoni, said that the Israelite troopers were well-trained, and behaved well. The soldiers scuffled with a few activists trying to block their access to the wheelhouse, but there were no major injuries, Peck said. Paul Larudee, a 64-year-old former language professor from El Cerrito, California onboard the "Sfendoni", was beaten and tased according to his family by the US Consul General and his lawyers; his family has reported that Israeli consular officials informed them that Larudee, a pacifist, was beaten after not to follow the orders of troops.

Crewman Shane Dillon reported that Israeli troops used stun guns, broke the nose of a Belgian woman among them, and beat another passenger. Australian photojournalist Kate Geraghty was attacked and tasered by Israeli troops aboard the "Challenger One", while attempting to photograph the raid.

Kutlu Tiryaki, a captain of the other vessel in the flotilla, said that the passengers did not have weapons at all, but only came to bring aid in a peaceful manner..

The final ship in the convoy gave in as it was raided and hoist a white flag.

9-19 were said to be dead and 32-50 were said to injured. 10 of the injured were Israelis and 1 of the dead was a Turkish politician . Israel has confirmed four being dead. Among the dead is İbrahim Bilgen, a Turkish politician from the Felicity Party. 

At least 32 activists who had been aboard the ships were arrested and incarcerated by the Israel Prisons Service, after they refused to sign deportation orders, including two who were wounded but refused hospital treatment.

Israel said that the navy forces "found weapons ready in advance and used against our forces." IDF photos displayed knives, metal and wooden poles, flares, wrenches and slingshots with marble projectiles said to have been used against the soldiers. The activists were said to have also lobbed stun grenades at IDF soldiers, and the IDF showed video illustrating this. The Israeli searches of the ship found bulletproof vests, night-vision goggles, and gas masks.

A press-release by the Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel said that violence against the soldiers was already planned, and that "light weaponry" was found on the ships, including pistols that would have been seized from activists on the "Mavi Marmara" by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) soldiers. 

A close-up picture presented to readers of "Jerusalem Post" as: "The array of equipment found on board the ships that made up the Gaza aid flotilla was as divergent as the flotilla’s stated aims", showed some knives and clubs. Israeli troops also admitted to finding wheelchairs, cleaning supplies and baby milk onboard both the ships.

A high ranking Norwegian officer stated after watching pictures that "This is not military equipment", and that most of the tools and kitchen knives would belong on a ship.

High ranking Officials in the Customs Undersecretariat called the Israeli "complete nonsense".

For the most part, the diplomatic result was unfairly harsh to Israel.

Egypt opened its Rafah Border Crossing with the Gaza Strip to allow medical aid to enter following world criticism of the raid. Hamas's leader Khaled Meshaal call for the border to be opened eminently. 

The Israeli blockade itself against Gaza itself is not illegal, and it's okay for Israeli ships to operate in international waters to enforce it," said Allen Weiner, former U.S. State Department 

The German newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung", said UN worldwide law says countries are not allowed to extend their rule on areas outside of their coastal waters. In Israel’s case, a from the coast.

South Africa's Ambasidor left Israel and reurned to South Africa as a form of protest. 

Turkey's deputy parliament speaker, Guldal Mumcu, said "[t]his attack was an open violation of United Nations rules and international law," and that "Turkey should seek justice against Israel through national and international legal authorities. The parliament expects the Turkish government to revise the political, military and economic relations with Israel, and to take effective measures."

Lawyer Dr. Turgut Tarhanlı of the University of Istanbul cited the ideal of innocent passage, under which vessels are given safe travel rights in a manner which is not "prejudicial to the peace, good order or the security" of the state.

Cyprus stated its belief that NGOs must be allowed to do their work freely and lawfully. Further, it called for the lifting of the blockade of Gaza. 

The rogue state of North Korea's Foreign Ministry condemned the Israel, which "mercilessly killed or wounded dozens of civilians aboard the boats." It went on to call the attack "crime against humanity perpetrated at the U.S. connivance and under its patronage and a blatant challenge to the Arabs including Palestinians and the Mideast peace process".

Queen's Gambit

The Queen's Gambit is a chess opening which starts with 1.d4 d5 2.c4. It is not really a gambit, because the pawn taken cannot be held. For example (simplest line):


Since the pawn can't be kept, Black (by taking the c-pawn) has given up the centre. The standard strategy then is for Black to mount a counter-attack on the White centre.

Now the white centre is balanced by the black counter-attack.

Wikipedia:An English Wikipedian's guide

The Simple English Wikipedia has a different target audience and smaller community. Hence, many things are different. Here's what you need to know to start editing (we call it "changing") pages here:

This Wikipedia is for children, people with learning disabilities, people learning English or those wanting to read articles in simpler English for whatever reason. Because of this, all language on this Wikipedia should be as simple as possible. If there are words you cannot simplify further, a useful thing to do is to link it like this: <nowiki></nowiki> which will link it to its definition on the Simple English Wiktionary.

Many of our policies and processes are similar to that of English Wikipedia. In fact, should there be need to implement any policies that we don't appear to have a policy page for, , but as a guideline, never policy. 

Here are some things that are different on this Wikipedia:
Our (which we call "quick deletion") is slightly different. 
Unlike the English Wikipedia, there are no strict rules about date or expansion for Did You Know (DYK) here. However, articles must be neutral and accurate while maintaining simple language, and the hook must be interesting and sourced. Nothing surprising there. Also, articles can be nominated more than once, as long as the hooks are different and the time between each nomination is long enough - usually about a fortnight.

An excerpt from : Some special rules need to be used for the Simple English Wikipedia.

Clermont county domestic relations court

The Clermont County, Ohio Domestic Relations is located in Batavia, Ohio. The court is a special common pleas court or specific jurisdiction court, created by both the Ohio Constitutional section that established common pleas courts, § 4.04 Common pleas court, and the Ohio statute, 2301.03(Q) that calls for the election and designation of a common pleas judge as a judge of the division of domestic relations. 

The court is assigned all divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal separation, and annulment cases. As such, it has jurisdiction over ending marriages, dividing property between spouses when a marriage ends, awarding spousal support when a marriage ends, setting and modifying child support when a marriage ends and allocating parental rights and responsibilities when a marriage ends.

In addition to the judge of the court, the court employees numerous other people. The court has magistrates (appointed judicial officers who make court orders, judgments and rulings in assigned cases), clerical and administrative staff and bailiffs as well as contracted workers such as guardian ad litems, appraisers, visitation supervisors and receivers who carry out the courts judgments.

The court is the seat of judgment for most of the family law issues in Clermont County, Ohio.

Currently, and since its inception in January 1987, the court's single judge is Michael Voris.

Goto

goto is a statement in many programming languages. It is a combination of the English words "go" and "to". It is a way to jump to another line of code.

Many languages support the goto statement, and many do not. In Java, goto is a reserved word, but cannot be used. (A "reserved word" is a word that is a "part" of the programming language and cannot be used for other things like naming variables.)

In Computer Science, there is a theory called the structured program theorem. This theory says that any program can be written in such a way that things are done with "functions" and "methods" (smaller sub-programs) instead of in one very big program and "goto" statements. The theory proves that the goto statement is not needed to write programs.

A goto statement is usually used with a "label". A label is a word that identifies a place in a piece of code. A goto statement in code usually looks like this:

In this example, the computer would jump to the location of "LABEL".

Many times the goto statement is combined with the if statement. In this case, the computer will only jump to another place in the code if something is true. For example:

This can be read as "if "some condition is true", then go to the location of "LABEL"."

Different programming languages have different restrictions or limits on the use of goto statements. For example, the C programming language does not allow a goto to jump to a location inside of another function (subprogram).

The Rage: Carrie 2

The Rage: Carrie 2 is a 1999 sequel to the classic 1976 horror movie "Carrie".

The director said that the movie shows how difficult it is to be a young woman today.

Rachael, like Carrie, is a high school outcast who attends Bates High School, except that it is a new building because Carrie destroyed the first one. Also like Carrie, she has telekinetic, the ability to move things with your mind, powers. Throughout the movie, there is flashbacks to events that happened in the first movie. Unlike Carrie, the prom violence is graphic impalings with flying CDs and fireplace pokers. Rachael's telekinetic powers are first shown when her Lisa commits suicide by jumping off of the roof of the school.

Rob Nelson, of City Pages, said that the movie's obsessive focus on predatory teen-male sexuality—and female fragility in the face of it—clearly pegs this as the work of a feminist. Marc Savlov, of Austin Chronicle said that the movie does not even deliver one good shock.

Ambient occlusion

Ambient Occlusion is a technique used in 3D computer graphics. In real life, if something is surrounded by other things, it is more likely to be blocked out by a shadow cast upon it, or "occluded". Ambient Occlusion calculates how much of some object, such as a surface, is blocked out by something else as compared to how much of that object is open to the rest of the environment. Things surrounded by other things that can occlude it or block it out are drawn darker than things more open to the environment, which are drawn lighter.

In chemistry, Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) is used to detect and measure concentrations of a particular metal element within a solution. The scientists atomise the sample (make it turn to individual atoms) and then see what light wavelengths it absorbs. Each type of chemical (element) absorbs a particular wavelength, so scientists can tell which chemicals are in the sample. Every element has a different atomic absorption spectrum because of the different light wavelengths it absorbs.

Snowy River National Park

Snowy River National Park is a national park in Victoria (Australia), 323 km east of Melbourne. The park includes much of the Snowy River.

A lot of the park is a protected wilderness area, with no access for vehicles. The park in the Little River Gorge area, has one of the last natural habitats for the endangered Brush-tailed Rock Wallaby. Numbers for this species are estimated as extremely small, with the rugged terrain making it difficult to count the population. Over 250 species have been found in the park, 29 are rare or threatened in Victoria. These include the Long-footed Potoroo, Spotted Quoll (Tiger Quoll), Giant Burrowing Frog and Eastern She-oak Skink.

Little River Gorge is Victoria's deepest gorge. The Little River drops 610 metres from the Wulgulmerang plateau over a distance 14 km to where it joins the Snowy River at a height of 122 metres above sea level.

McKillops Road is the northern park boundary, with the Alpine National Park to the north of the road. The road is not suitable for caravans, trailers and large trucks because it is steep and winding. At McKillops Bridge the road which crosses the Snowy River near its junction with the Deddick River. A camping site near McKillops Bridge has excellent spots for swimming. It is also a good place to begin canoe and raft trips through the rugged gorges downstream. It is the start for the 18km Silver Mine Walking Track and the short Snowy River Trail.

Trapezius muscle

In human, trapezius muscle or trapezius is a large muscle that extends longitudinally on the upper portion of a human spine. Its functions are to move the scapulae and support the arm.

The trapezius has three functional regions: the superior region, which supports the weight of the arm; the intermediate region, which retracts the scapulae; and the inferior region, which rotates and depresses the scapulae.

The upper portion of the trapezius can be developed by elevating the shoulders. Middle fibers are developed by pulling shoulder blades together. The lower part can be developed by drawing the shoulder blades downward while keeping the arms almost straight and stiff.

Long Wittenham

Long Wittenham is a village on the south bank of the River Thames in South Oxfordshire. In 1974 it came from Berkshire to the county of Oxfordshire. 

There are crop marks (dating from the 6th Century) that there must have been a large collection of buildings, maybe a royal palace or at least high status Saxon enclosure. The number of objects that were found in Saxon burial sites around the village support this. These large, Saxon burial sites also indicate a good sized population, that lasted over many years. 

The village was mentioned in the Domesday Book. By Tudor times, it had a population of around 200, with crops: wheat, oats, barley and even rye. Following a local legend Oliver Cromwell addressed the villagers on his way to his niece's wedding, in neighbouring Little Wittenham. 

The village Cross has First Millennial origins: the base dating from the 7th century. St. Birinus preached here when he brought Christianity to the area. The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary, begun around 1120, is on the site of a previous Saxon church. Cruck Cottage can be architecturally dated to being around 800 years old and as such is (possibly) the oldest house in South Oxfordshire.

The building housing Pendon Museum, originally started life as The Three Poplars - a working man's pub. It was sold in 1954 and now houses a model railway museum. 

Long Wittenham is in the Thames Valley north of Didcot, and southeast of Abingdon. To the west is the village of Appleford, which has the nearest railway station, on the line between Didcot and Oxford.

Snowy River

The Snowy River is a major river in south-eastern Australia. It starts on the slopes of Mount Kosciuszko, Australia's highest mountain. It gets its water from the eastern slopes of the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales, and then flows through the Snowy River National Park in Victoria and finally into Bass Strait. Up until the middle of the 20th century, the river was known for the large amount of fresh water it carried, its wide reach and large rapids. 

The river's course and surroundings have not changed very much, as it is protected by the Snowy River National Park. However its flow of water was almost stopped in the 1950's by the building of the Snowy Mountains Scheme to make hydroelectricity. Four large dams were built, at Guthega, Island Bend, Eucumbene, and Jindabyne, as well as many smaller dams and tunnels. Less than 1% of the river flow, as measured at Jindabyne, New South Wales, continued to flow down the river. Concern over the health of river led to an agreement between the state and federal governments to increase the amount of water released back into the river. From 2002 to 2008 the flow was increased from 1% to 4%. The agreement planned to increase the flow to 15% by 2009 and 21% by 2012.

Hebrews was a civilization that originated among a Semitic people in the ancient Near East. The term Hebrew was not originally an ethnic designation. The Hebrews were a class of people who worked as hired servants in Ancient Egypt at about the time of Ramses II. They had probably been in Egypt for several hundred years before the kings of Egypt decided to enslave them. They may well have been descendants of the 12 tribes of Israel, which owed their origin to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The Hebrews' escape from Egypt is recounted in the Torah in the book called Exodus in English, or Shemot in Hebrew.

Mall of America

Mall of America (also MOA, MoA, the Megamall) is a large shopping mall in the Twin Cities suburb of Bloomington, Minnesota, USA. The mall is southeast of the junction of Interstate 494 and Minnesota State Highway 77, north of the Minnesota River and is across the interstate from the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. In the United States, it is the second largest inside mall in terms of retail space but is largest in terms of total enclosed floor area. Opened in 1992, the mall received 40 million visitors in 2006. "Triple Five Group", owned by the Ghermezian family of Canada, fully owns and manages the property.

Mall of America (founded by John Scott & Benjamin Clark) has a gross area of 4.2 million square feet (390,000 m²), with 2.5 million sq ft. (230,000 m²) available as retail space. The mall is a nearly symmetric building, with a roughly rectangular floor plan. Over 520 stores are arranged along three levels of pedestrian walkways on the sides of the rectangle, with a fourth level on the East side. An addition planned north of the mall will allow for up to 900 stores. Four "anchor" department stores are at the corners. The Mall is organized into four different zones, each with its own decorative style.

Despite Minnesota's often cold temperatures in the winter, only the mall's entrances are heated. Heat is allowed in through skylights above Nickelodeon Universe. Heat is produced by lighting fixtures, other electric devices and also by employees and guests of the mall in sufficient amounts to keep it comfortable. In fact, even during the winter, air conditioning systems need to be run nonstop during peak hours to ensure a comfortable shopping environment.

Although the common areas are unheated, the individual stores do have heating systems. 

Two nearly identical seven story parking ramps on east and west sides provide 12,550 parking spaces. Parking lots on the north and south of the building, along with nearby overflow parking, bring the total number of spaces up to approximately 20,000.

The mall was designed and built by "Triple Five Group", owned by the Ghermezian brothers of Canada, who also own the biggest shopping mall in North America, the West Edmonton Mall. Mall of America is on the past site of Metropolitan Stadium, where the Minnesota Vikings and Minnesota Twins played until the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome opened. The teams left Metropolitan Stadium in 1982. A plaque in the amusement park is where home plate used to be in that stadium. One seat from Met Stadium was placed in Mall of America at its exact location (including elevation) in the stadium, to recognize a 520 foot home run hit by hall-of-famer Harmon Killebrew on June 3, 1967.

In 1986, The Bloomington Port Authority signed an agreement with the Ghermezian Organization. Groundbreaking for the mall took place on June 14, 1989. Organizations involved include Melvin Simon and Associates, Teachers Insurance and Annuity (a.k.a. TIAA), the Triple Five Group, and the office of architect Jon Jerde.

The mall opened its doors to the public August 11, 1992. Even before opening, Mall of America had earned several nicknames, including "The Megamall" (or "The Megamess" during construction), "Sprawl of America", "Hugedale" (in reference to the four major "Dale" shopping malls within the Twin Cities, Rosedale, Southdale, Ridgedale and Brookdale) and, simply, "The Mall".

It became the second largest shopping mall in total area and largest in total store vendors in the United States when it opened, however, the mall has never been the largest in the world (at the time it opened, it was #2 globally to the West Edmonton Mall). Mall of America is the most visited shopping mall in the world with more than 40 million visitors annually (or roughly eight times the population of the state of Minnesota). The mall employs over 12,000 workers.

Starting on September 4, 1995, The Mall had an event for live television for the first time. Time-Warner owned professional wrestling company World Championship Wrestling set up in the building for the Inaugural edition of WCW Monday Nitro - also the WCW debut of Lex Luger, under his "The Narcissist" gimmick. This first broadcast on Turner Network Television, along with later editions broadcast from the Mall, would become a well known part of the federation's competition with The World Wrestling Federation.

During its run as a large entertainment and retail venue, certain aspects-such as-have been criticized and closely looked at. A Mardi Gras themed bar, Fat Tuesdays, shut its doors in early 2000 due to indecent exposure and alcohol related offenses, for ignoring warnings from the mall and Bloomington police to not repeat incidents caught on tape the year before. Following that incident were other problems, such as foot traffic within the Mall after the bars (all on the fourth floor) had closed for the evening. The Mall storefronts were closed, however. The Hooters restaurant, the Cantina #1 restaurant and the Theatres at Mall of America movie theater are the only establishments remaining on the fourth floor.

In 2003, after a six year legal battle between Simon Property Group, the managing general partner of the property, and the Ghermezian brothers/Triple Five Group, over majority ownership of the site, a federal appeals judge ruled in favor of the Ghermezians, effectively transferring control and planning authority of the mall back to its original founders. The dispute stemmed from a 1999 purchase of Teacher's Insurance's 27.5% equity stake by Simon Properties, giving them majority ownership. The Ghermezians claimed they were never told of the deal and sued Simon, citing fiduciary responsibility.

On November 3, 2006, the Ghermezians gained full control of Mall of America, spending US$1 billion to do so. The ruling cleared the way for Triple Five to begin work on what is being called "Phase II".

Phase II is the planned expansion for MOA, developing a large, empty area of land north of the mall which was the former home of the Met Center indoor arena and integrating an IKEA store built on a portion of the property in 2004. Phase II, in current form, includes a dinner theatre, ice rink, three hotels, and a waterpark; similar in design to the West Edmonton Mall. The expansion will not make MOA exceed the size of the WEM (itself going under expansion). 

MOA currently estimates costs of $1.9 billion for the expansion, doubling the mall's size with a 5.2 million-square-foot extension. The mall's developers have asked for $234 million in state and local subsidies, but the request was vetoed as part of a larger bill by Gov. Tim Pawlenty on its first appearance in the 2006-07 session. Questions have arisen among Bloomington city officials as to the fiscal ability of the Ghermezians to finish Phase II.

In the meantime, MOA has signed papers to bring in Great Wolf Resorts as the waterpark operator, as well as Bass Pro Shops and a Kimpton Hotel. The expansion section will connect to the mall on all four levels, and an adjacent IKEA store via a second level bridge. There will be an NHL-sized ice rink for public & private skating. There will also be an additional parking ramp, adding 8,000 parking spaces.

There will also be fine art exhibits planned in the expansion, and two upscale department stores. Another plan that was in the works would have been fashions, architecture, and restaurants based after Europe.

On May 18, 2008, the Minnesota State Legislature passed a bill granting the city of Bloomington the right to raise property and sales taxes to pay for the MOA expansion.

Nickelodeon Universe is an indoor theme park in the center of the mall, formerly known as Knott's Camp Snoopy, Camp Snoopy, and The Park at MOA. The park features roller coasters, among numerous other rides and attractions, and is the largest indoor theme park in the United States. Unlike many indoor amusement parks, Nickelodeon Universe has a great deal of natural foliage in and about the park, and its floor has a wide variance in height - the highest ground level in the park is 15 feet above the lowest. This allows for a far more naturalistic experience than would normally occur in an indoor amusement park.

The park features two new roller coasters; SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge and Avatar Airbender. It also has a miniature golfing section called Moose Mountain. With 18 holes, it is designed to create a challenge for players hoping to seek a hole in one.

Guests travel through a 300 foot long curved tunnel through 14 feet of water to view over 4,500 sea creatures including sharks, turtles, stingrays, and many more. Underwater Adventures offers special events such as sleepovers, scuba diving, snorkeling, and birthday parties.



Twin Cities public events:




The mall is used as a major transportation hub in the region, with bus and light rail service linking the mall to other destinations. Regular public transit service is provided by Metro Transit and other area bus lines, and nearby Mystic Lake Casino offers free shuttles to their establishment. The primary bus/rail station for scheduled local service is in the lower level of the eastern parking ramp. There, the Hiawatha Line light rail line connects the mall to the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport and from there to downtown Minneapolis (another major shopping destination in the region, particularly during weekdays). The mall is being discouraged as a park and ride facility, and overnight parking is banned to prevent passengers taking the train to the airport. Commuters are encouraged to use the nearby 28th Avenue Station's parking lot. The mall is the first stop on the Cedar Avenue Bus Rapid Transitway and the nineteenth, final stop on the Hiawatha Line.

<doc id="248229" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=248229" title="Painful sexual act">
Painful sexual act

Painful sexual act is a condition of repeated or persistent genital pain before, during, or after 
sexual act due to physical, psychogenic and emotional causes. Doctors call the condition as dyspareunia. It occurs in women and men. The condition affects up to one-fifth of women at some point in their lives.

The woman experiencing painful sexual act may be distracted from feeling pleasure and excitement. Both lubrication of vagina and vaginal dilation decrease. When the vagina is dry and undilated, thrusting of the penis is painful. Even after the original source of pain has disappeared, a woman may feel pain simply because she expects pain. 

In the majority of instances, there is an original physical cause. 
There are numerous physical conditions that can contribute to painful sexual act. A careful physical examination and medical history are indicated. Common physical causes include infections of the vagina, lower urinary tract, cervix, or fallopian tubes, endometriosis, surgical scar tissue (following episiotomy); and ovarian cysts and tumors. . Among the infections are mycotic organisms, candidiasis, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, urinary tract infections, coliform bacteria, monilial organisms and herpes). 
Anatomic conditions, such as hymenal remnants, female genital mutilation, when the entrance to the vagina has become too small for normal penetration, can contribute to discomfort of sexual act (Sarrell and Sarrell 1989). 
Estrogen deficiency is a common cause of painful sexual act among women after menopause. Dryness of the vagina is often reported by lactating women. Women undergoing radiation therapy for pelvic malignancy experience painful sexual act due to the atrophy of the vaginal walls and their susceptibility to trauma. Vaginal dryness is seen in Sjögren's syndrome, which attacks the exocrine glands that produce saliva and tears. 

Painful sexual act may be one of the first symptoms of a cystitis. Patients may struggle with bladder pain and discomfort during or after sex. For women with cystitis, pain usually occurs the following day, the result of painful, spasming muscles of pelvis floor. Cystitis patients also struggle with urinary frequency and/or urinary urgency.

There are a number of physical factors as well. Pain is sometimes experienced in the testicular or glans area of the penis immediately after ejaculation. Infections of the prostate, bladder, or seminal vesicles can lead to burning or itching sensations following ejaculation. Men suffering from cystitis may experience intense pain at the moment of ejaculation and is focused at the tip of the penis. Gonorrheal infections are associated with burning or sharp penis pains during ejaculation. Urethritis or prostatitis can make genital stimulation painful or uncomfortable. Anatomic deformities of the penis (retraction of a too-tight foreskin) may also result in pain during sexual act. 
In men pain in the genital organs during ejaculation or immediately thereafter is experienced as sharp, stabbing, and/or burning, it may be persistent and returning. The duration of pain is usually brief. The immediate cause of psychogenic post ejaculatory pain is the involuntary painful spasm or cramping of certain pain-sensitive muscles in the male genital and reproductive organs, the painful muscle cramps may be attributable to a man’s conflict about ejaculating. 

A pelvic floor disorder can also be the cause of pain during and after sex.

Sufferers will see several doctors before a correct diagnosis is made. Sufferers are also often hesitant to seek treatment for chronic vulvar pain, especially since many women begin experiencing symptoms around the same time they become sexually active. Before being successfully diagnosed patients sometimes are told that the pain is "in their head". 
For the diagnosis doctor carefully takes a history and carefully examines the pelvis to duplicate the discomfort and to identify a site or source of the pelvic pain.
The diagnosis of painful sexual act has to be differentiated from conditions known as ‘’’chronic vulvar pain’’’ and vaginismus. It is worth to be sure whether the painful sexual act is acquired or lifelong and whether it is generalized (complete) or situational. During the first two weeks, painful sexual act caused by penis insertion or movement of the penis in the vagina or by deep penetration is often due to disease or injury deep within the pelvis. Inquiry should determine whether the pain is superficial or deep - whether it occurs primarily at the vaginal outlet or vaginal barrel or upon deep thrusting against the cervix. The possible role of psychological factors in either causing or maintaining the pain must be acknowledged. 

Atrophy of vagina as a source of painful sexual act is most frequently seen in women after menopause and is generally associated with estrogen deficiency. The latter is associated with inadequacy of lubrication of vagina, which can lead to painful friction during sexual act.

Neem

Neem (Azadirachta indica) is a tree in the mahogany family Meliaceae. It is native to India, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Pakistan. It grows in tropical and semi-tropical regions. Neem is known by many different names, including Nimm (Punjabi), Arya Veppu (Malayalam), Azad Dirakht (Persian), Nimba (Sanskrit and Marathi), DogonYaro (in some Nigerian languages), Margosa, Neeb (Arabic), Nimtree, Vepu, Vempu, Vepa (Telugu), Bevu (Kannada), Kohomba (Sinhala), Vembu (Tamil), Tamar (Burmese), sầu đâu, xoan Ấn Độ (Vietnamese), Paraiso (Spanish), and Indian Lilac (English). In East Africa it is also known as "Muarubaini" (Swahili), which means "the tree of the 40", as it is said to treat 40 different diseases.

Neem is a fast-growing tree that can reach up to 15–20 m (about 50–65 feet) tall, and sometimes even to 35–40 m (115–131 feet). It is evergreen, but in serious drought it may lose most or nearly all of its leaves. The branches are spread far apart.

Products made from neem have been used in India for over two millennia for their medicinal properties: they are said to be antifungal, antidiabetic, antibacterial, antiviral, contraceptive and sedative\ref{http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/t_es/t_es_agraw_neem.htm}. Neem products are also used in selectively controlling pests in plants. It is considered a large part of Ayurvedic medicine.

Infobox television film is used to summarize information about television films (TV movies) and miniseries.

External links to resources such as the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), Allmovie, TV.com and any official website are no longer included in this template. Nevertheless, these resources and others may be usefully added to the External Links section of the article using the following templates:

The infobox may be added by pasting the template as shown below into an article, typically at the top of an article above the lead section.

All parameters are optional.

Ideally, an image of the film's original theatrical release poster should be uploaded and added to the infobox to serve as an identifying image for the article. Poster images can be found at websites such as Internet Movie Poster Awards or Internet Movie Poster Database. If a poster image cannot be found for the film, or if the film did not have a theatrical release, then a cover image of the film's display case (VHS, DVD, etc.) may be used instead. Cover images can be found at commercial websites such as Amazon.com or Amazon.co.uk. In the absence of an appropriate poster or cover image, a screenshot of the film's title card may also be used. When replacing an existing image, upload the new image over the old image (where possible), and update the relevant details on the image description page. Click here to find instructions for uploading non-free images.

Once uploaded, place the file name of the image, e.g., FILM TITLE poster.jpg (or a similar description), in the codice_1 field of the infobox, but do not include the codice_2 part of the file name. The codice_3 field only needs to be filled if the width of the image is less than 200 pixels (the default image width used by the infobox); enter the actual width of the image, in pixels, so it is not stretched in the infobox. The codice_4 field should describe the image, i.e., identifying it as "Theatrical release poster" or "DVD cover"; repeating the title of the film here is not necessary. Below is an example of how to use the fields:

The film infobox is too small to reproduce the long lists of release dates provided by the "Internet Movie Database". Release dates should therefore be restricted to the film's earliest release, whether it was at a film festival or a public release, and the release date(s) in the country or countries that produced the film, excluding sneak previews or screenings. should be used for the film's initial release. If other release dates are found to be notable, it may be appropriate to include them in the main body of the article (example).

Release dates for straight-to-video and television films should follow the preceding guideline for home releases and airings, respectively.

Some users like to use flag icons instead of country names. However, this should be avoided, as flags are less recognizable than country names. See for a more detailed rationale.

When this infobox template was first created, in December 2004, one of the parameters created an external link to the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). Irrespective of the fact that IMDb is not used as a for content in Wikipedia articles, it still is a resource that many people, including editors "and" readers of Wikipedia, often turn to.

In more recent years, additional external websites have become increasingly useful resources, including Allmovie, Box Office Mojo, Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes. Also, modern films almost invariably have an official website. As a consequence, new external links were added to and removed from the infobox as on the subject.

Discussions about the fate of these links took place in numerous places over some time, with a number of people advocating removal of all external links from the infobox, if not the article as a whole. Others spoke of the value of having at least a link to IMDb in the infobox. Eventually, a far from undisputed consensus arose to remove all external links from the infobox and to move them to the External links section where appropriate in view of the .

Important points towards this included fact that the infobox could not include all of the available links and that it would be inappropriate to pick and choose one or a few of those links over others. Suggestions that losing access to the most useful of the available links (typically IMDb) would damage the usefulness of film articles were not found persuasive by many since such links could still be included in the External links section and the table of contents linking to the external links section having "all" of the useful external links is adjacent the infobox.

External links to resources such as the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), Allmovie and any official website are no longer included in this template. Nevertheless, these resources and others may be usefully added to the "External links" section of the article using the following templates:

<doc id="248357" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=248357" title="Nematomorpha">
Nematomorpha

The Nematomorpha are a phylum (or group) of parasitic animals that look similar to nematode worms and live in similar environments. That is why their names are similar. They are sometimes called Gordiacea, and are also known as "Horsehair worms". 

They range in size from long and can reach in extreme cases up to 2 meters, and they are in diameter. Horsehair worms can be discovered in damp areas such as watering troughs, streams, puddles, and cisterns. 

About 326 species are known and an estimate suggests that there may be about 2000 species worldwide. 

Fossilized worms have been reported from Lower Cretaceous Burmese amber 100–110 million years ago.

The adult worms are free living, and, in North America, are usually found only in the summer months in or near shallow water.

The larvae are parasitic on beetles, cockroaches, and Orthoptera (like grasshoppers and crickets). These are their final hosts, but since they do not live in water, the nematomorph life cycle has an extra stage. 

A day or two after they come out of their hosts, the adult worms mate in the water, and then around mid-August or Mid-October, they lay their eggs in the water. It takes about a month for the larvae to develop inside the egg. Once the larvae hatch, they somehow get into gastropods (like snails and slugs), insects, or earthworms, which live in moist habitats. There they build a cyst, and grow. The animal they grow inside is called an interim (temporary) host, because a final host is still needed.

Next, developing nematomorph worms can be found in their final hosts (beetles, etc.). It is not clear how they get there, but probably the final host eats the interim host with the larvae inside them. After they appear in the final host, the nematomorphs begin to eat it from the inside.

The nematomorph may control the host, leading it towards water and even causing it to jump into the water. Then it breaks out of the beetle in or near the water and finds a knot of other worms mating.

<doc id="248365" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=248365" title="Burgess Shale">
Burgess Shale

The Burgess Shale Formation — located in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia — is one of the world's most celebrated fossil fields, and the best of its kind. It is famous for the exceptional preservation of the soft parts of its fossils. It is ~505 million years old (Middle Cambrian), one of the earliest soft-parts fossil beds.

The rock unit is a black shale, and crops out at a number of localities near the town of Field in the Yoho National Park.

The Burgess Shale was discovered by palaeontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott in 1909, towards the end of the season's fieldwork. He returned in 1910 with his sons, and established a quarry on the flanks of Fossil Ridge. The fact that fossils were of soft-bodied forms, and the range of organisms new to science, led him to return to the quarry almost every year until 1924. At this point, aged 74, he had amassed over 65,000 specimens. Describing the fossils was a vast task, pursued by Walcott until his death in 1927. Walcott, led by scientific opinion at the time, attempted to categorise all fossils into living taxa. As a result, the fossils were regarded as little more than curiosities at the time. It was not until 1962 that a first-hand reinvestigation of the fossils was attempted, by Alberto Simonetta. This led scientists to recognise that Walcott had barely scratched the surface of information available in the Burgess Shale. It was clear that the organisms did not fit comfortably into modern groups.

Solnhofen limestone

The Solnhofen limestone is the world's most famous fossil site. It is a lagerstätte of Upper Jurassic limestone which has preserved many fossils in great detail. The specimens of "Archaeopteryx" are perhaps the world's most valuable fossils, because they are the ealiest fossils of a bird capable of flight.

The Solnhofen beds lie in the German state of Bavaria (Bayern), halfway between Nuremberg (Nürnberg) and Munich (München). They were originally quarried as a source of limestone for lithography.

In the late Jurassic this area was an archipelago at the edge of the Tethys Sea. This included placid lagoons which had limited access to the open sea because they were surrounded by coral reefs. Water runoff from the land was low and, under the sun, evaporation was high. Salinity rose so high that the resulting brine could not support life, except at the top of the water column.

The lowest water was devoid of oxygen by lack of water mixing and rapid evaporation. Many ordinary scavengers were absent. It also follows that almost all of the fossilised animals were not living in the lagoon. They must have lived on land, in the air, or out to sea beyond the reef. Then when they died, they fell, drifted, or were washed into the lagoons from the air, ocean or land. Occasional storms at sea would have killed flying animals, and swept fish over the reef in a suspension of finely-dispersed lime. There the bodies sank into the dead zone and were preserved.

Once in the lagoon, bodies became buried in soft carbonate mud. Thus, many delicate creatures avoided consumption by scavengers or being torn apart by currents. The wings of dragonflies, the imprints of stray feathers, and terrestrial plants that washed into the lagoons were all preserved. The fossils are not numerous, but some of them are spectacular, and their range gives a comprehensive picture of a local Jurassic ecosystem.

At times, the lagoons almost dried out, exposing sticky carbonate muds that trapped insects and even a few small dinosaurs. Over 600 species have been identified. Seven genera and up to 29 species of pterosaur have been found. This suggests that in this ecosystem pterosaurs were more common and diversified than birds. The pterosaur sizes ranged from that of a sparrow to 1.2 m (4 ft) in length.

The fine-grained texture of the mud silt forming the limestone is ideal for making lithographic plates for printing illustrations. Extensive quarrying in the 19th century revealed many fossil finds, as commemorated in the name "Archaeopteryx lithographica", all the specimens of which come from these deposits. The closest modern analogue to the Solnhofen conditions is said to be Orca Basin in the northern Gulf of Mexico, though that area is much deeper than the Solnhofen lagoons.

Aenictogiton

Aenictogiton is a genus of ants. The genus has seven species. The genus is given its own subfamily, Aenictogitoninae. All of the species are known only from males from middle Africa and show a phylogenetic liking to the army ants (and are in the dorylomorph subfamilies). Nothing is known about the workers, queens and behavior of these ants. A few not described species are known to exist in a few collections in the world.

<doc id="248391" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=248391" title="Ketosis">
Ketosis

Ketosis occurs when ketone bodies are released into the bloodstream due to low glycogen levels in the liver. Ketone bodies are created by the breakdown of fatty acid.

The body goes through ketosis when there is not enough carbohydrate to refill glycogen in the liver. An example of this kind of diet is the Atkins diet, where followers start by eating fewer than 20g of carbohydrates per day. It takes 48 hours for the brain to switch from glucose to ketone bodies. Ketosis helps the body prevent using protein, from muscles, for gluconeogenesis to make glucose.

Rhabdomyosarcoma

Rhabomyosarcoma is a form of soft-tissue sarcoma that occurs often in children. It has differnt cellular subtypes, including embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and aveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is the cellular subtype in slightly more than half of patients. It can arise in the parameningeal area, genitourinary region, in the eye, area in and around the head and neck, or extremities (arms/legs). 
Rhabdomyosarcoma is usually treated with radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery if it has not spread beyond the primary site.
Patients whose disease has not spread beyond the primary tumor have a five-year survival rate of up to 80% when treated well, but patients whose disease has spread past the primary tumor have a five-year survival rate of only 30%.

<doc id="248410" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=248410" title="Underweight">
Underweight

The term underweight refers to humans that have much less weight than they should. Being underweight is bad for the overall health of the person affected. It is normal what a person's weights changes over time. Being underweight is often defined using a measure called the body mass index which calculates a score, based on height and weight. If this score is below 18.5, a person is generally said to be underweight. This is only a general indication, though as the scores must not be calculated for everyone. It does not apply to children and adolescents, for example.

Being underweight can have different causes:

There are problems that are related to being underweight. Very often being underweight is not the first problem. Rather, it often is the effect of another condition or disease. Unexpected weight loss requires the attention of a doctor. There might be another disease. If that disease is treated, the weight problem also disappears.

Another problem underweight people face is that the weight problem affects their health: Their immune system is weakened, and they may get sick more often. People who are underweight because they cannot get or afford the right food need special attention. Women who are underweight may not have their menstruation and face difficult pregnancies.

Once they were being underweight, psychically, they may feel sad and worried about their health. Therefore, family and friends should support them to help them get rid of their unhappiness.

Pot-in-pot refrigerator

The pot-in-pot refrigerator, also known as a Zeer الزير in Arabic, is a food cooling device which keeps food cool without electricity by using evaporation.

It is made by putting a clay pot inside a larger clay pot with wet sand in between the pots and a wet cloth on top. As the water evaporates it cools the inside, letting food stored in the inner pot to be kept fresh for some time. It must be placed in a dry, ventilated place for the water to evaporate to the outside.

Evaporative coolers perform poorly or not at all in climates with high humidity.

Although Mohammed Bah Abba of Nigeria patented the device in 1995 and was awarded a Rolex Laureate (Rolex Awards for Enterprise) in 2000 for developing the “pot-in-pot preservation/cooling system”, the device was known at least as early as the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, as seen by the hieroglyphic kbb, "to cool".

<doc id="248461" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=248461" title="Jehol biota">
Jehol biota

The Jehol biota includes all the living organisms – the ecosystem – of northeastern China between 133 to 120 million years ago. This is the Lower Cretaceous ecosystem which left fossils in the Yixian Formation, some 125–121 mya, and the Jiufotang Formation. It is also believed to have left fossils in the Sinuiju series of North Korea. 

The ecosystem in the Lower Cretaceous was dominated by wetlands and numerous lakes (not rivers, deltas, or marine habitats). Rainfall was seasonal, alternating between semi-arid, and mesic conditions. The climate was temperate. The Jehol ecosystem was interrupted at times by ash eruptions from volcanoes to the west. The word "Jehol" was the name given during the Japanese occupation of North-East China, 1933–1946.

The Jehol Biota is particularly noteworthy for the very high diversity of fossils and the very large numbers of individuals of each species that have been recovered.
The biota includes many species that were previously known only from the Upper Jurassic or earlier. These include the dinosaur "Sinosauropteryx", the pterosaur "Dendrorhynchoides", and even a primitive protomammal – a tritylodont synapsid – from Lower Cretaceous Japan; even though tritylodonts were previously thought to have gone extinct in the Middle Jurassic. It also has the earliest and most basal (primitive) known members of groups which spread all around the world by the Upper Cretaceous, including neoceratopsians, therizinosaurs, tyrannosaurs, and oviraptors.

The Jehol Biota has produced fossils of plant mega- and microfossils, including the earliest angiosperms, charophytes and dinocysts, snails (gastropods), clams (bivalves), superabundant aquatic arthropods called conchostracans, ostracods, shrimps, insects, spiders, fish, frogs and salamanders, turtles, choristoderes, lizards (squamata), pterosaurs, and dinosaurs including dinobirds, the largest mammals known from the Mesozoic, and a great diversity of birds including the earliest advanced birds, and the smallest and largest birds known from the Mesozoic.

The forests around the lakes were dominated by conifers including members of the podocarp pine, araucaria, and cypress families. There were also ginkgos, bennettitaleans, ephedra, horsetails, ferns, and mosses. The leaves and needles of the trees show adaptations to a dry season, but some of the ferns and mosses are types that grow in very wet habitats. It is possible that the latter avoided dry conditions by growing very close to bodies of water. "Archaefructus" has been described as the earliest known flowering plant (Angiosperm), and it is reconstructed as a water plant.

The fossils have been found in several sites of exceptional preservation. The two most famous are the Yixian and Jiufotang Formations. The Yixian and Jiufotang Formations are "Lagerstatten", meaning that they have exceptionally good conditions for fossil preservation. The fossils are numerous, but also very well preserved. They often have articulated skeletons (bones connected), soft tissues, colour patterns, stomach contents, and twigs with leaves and flowers still attached. 

Palaeontologists deduced two things from this. The first is that the land animals and plants were washed into the lakes very gently, or were already in the lakes when they died. They do not show the damage seen in fossils formed by large floods. Second, volcanic ash is commonly interbedded with lake sediments, and ashfalls seem to have quickly buried the fossilized organisms, created anoxic conditions around them, and prevented scavenging.

The biota probably extended as far as North Korea. Its earliest appearance may be in another Chinese lagerstätte, the Huajiying Formation.

A geological formation in Liaoning, N.E. China. Outstanding preservation in deposits of siliclastic (SiO) sediment alternating with basalt. First recognised by the Japanese when they occupied Manchuria ('Jehol'). Dates: 125–121 million years ago. Contains the famous "Confuciusornis" beds.

The Jiufotang Formation is a Lower Cretaceous geological formation in Liaoning. It has yielded fossils of feathered dinosaurs, primitive birds, pterosaurs, and other organisms. 

The exact age of the Jiufotang has been debated for years, with estimates ranging from the Upper Jurassic to the Lower Cretaceous. Argon radiometry confirmed a Lower Cretaceous age for the site, 120.3 +/-0.7 million years ago. Fossils of "Microraptor" and "Jeholornis" are from the Jiufotang.

Lower Cretaceous, but exact dates uncertain. This is probably the earliest of the Jehol biota lagerstätte sites. Contains sedimentary members interspersed with volcanic ash. Contains birds, dinosaurs and fish.

The New York Draft Riots (July 13 – July 16, 1863; known at the time as Draft Week) were violent disturbances in New York City. They happened when anger with President Lincoln and his laws was highest. At first it just wanted to show anger at the draft. But the protests became violent and "a virtual racial pogrom, with uncounted numbers of blacks murdered on the streets". Major General John E. Wool said on July 16, "Martial law ought (should) to be proclaimed, but I have not a sufficient (enough) force to enforce it." The military stopped the mob using weapons. However, they had already destroyed many buildings, including homes and an orphanage for black children.

FC Erzgebirge Aue

The Fußballclub Erzgebirge Aue is a football club which plays in the German 2. Bundesliga. The club is from Aue in Saxony. 
The club was founded as SG Aue in 1945 and on 1 November 1948 became BSG Pneumatik Aue. Changes in sponsorship led to a change in name to Zentra Wismut Aue in 1949 and then simply to SC Wismut Aue in 1951. 1951 they promoted to the DDR-Oberliga. In 1954 the government decided that the nearby city Chemnitz(now called Karl-Marx-Stadt) should have a good team. So the name of Aue was changed to SC Wismut Karl Marx Stadt. But the club still played in Aue. 1963 Karl Marx Stadt got a own team so the club was renamed to SC Wismut Aue. 

Till 1989 Aue was one of the most successful teams in the DDR. They were 3 times winner of the DDR Oberliga (1956, 1957, 1959) and won the Cup once(1955).

Bundesliga after the 1st place there. 2007 they were again relegated but came back in 2010.

Digital rights

Digital rights are the rights of people regarding what they can do with their computer. There are many cases that need special thought related to digital rights, such as the right to have data accessible to a few people (privacy) and freedom of expression. Very often the word is used when referring to computer networks such as the Internet. 

In 2003, the United Nations held a special talk, called the World Summit on the Information Society. One of the tasks of this talk was to make the digital divide smaller. The digital divide separates countries into "rich" ones and "poor" ones. For "poor" countries accessing the internet is much more hard. After long talks, all people in the talk signed a closing statement.

The statement pointed out that human rights were universal, and that they could not be divided. They were also related to the basic freedoms that the Vienna Declaration had defined, and could not be separated from them. In addition, democracy as well as sustainable development should be respected and the rule of law should be made stronger.

This declaration also makes specific reference to the importance of the right to freedom of expression in the "Information Society". It says:
"We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the Information Society, and as outlined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organization. It is central to the Information Society. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits of the Information Society offers."
Digital rights management is in this area, as an example.

Enigma (machine)

The Enigma machine was created for Germany by Arthur Scherbius in World War I. It is a form of changing the letters of a message so that it appears to be scrambled letters (or, random letters). Think of the machine as a typewriter combined with a fancy odometer. The theory behind the machine is that each letter typed should be shifted by a random number. This is accomplished by three rotors which rotate once per letter, when a rotor shifts it defines a new electrical pathway (i.e. a new shift amount). So as the message is typed the rotors move along to define new shifts each letter. A video explains this simplified version of the Enigma - Watch Simplified Enigma

However the Allies found out how to read messages in the Enigma code during World War II. A team called "Ultra", including Alan Turing, figured it out.

On 15th July 2011, Queen Elizabeth (UK), visited Bletchley Park, where the machine is kept in the Museum, paid tribute to those who created this amazing "code-breaker", since the use of it cut short World War by successfully breaking the complex codes by Nazi Germany.

The Northwest Passage was a supposed passage to reach Asia by a western route. At the time, Portugal had control over the eastern route through Africa to Asia. Spain wanted to have a route that it could have control over. This caused most European countries to find a possible route and also helped boost the colonization of the western hemisphere.

The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is a 2010 horror movie. It is written and directed by Tom Six. The movie is about a mad doctor who wants to stick people together so they become what he calls his 'human centipede'.

"The Human Centipede" did not get very many good reviews, but Tom Six made a sequel to the movie called "The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)".

Lindsay (played by Ashley C. Williams) and Jenny (played by Ashlynn Yennie) are two American girls who are on holiday in Germany. They are kidnapped by a mad doctor called Dr. Heiter (played by Dieter Laser) after their car breaks down and they go to his house to look for help. The doctor Heiter then kidnaps a Japanese man called Katsuro (played by Akihiro Kitamura). The doctor tells the three that he is world-famous for separating conjoined twins, but wants to join people together so they share a single digestive system. He tells the three how he will connect his three victims together mouth-to-anus. Lindsay tries to escape, but is captured before she can get away. The doctor then sews the three together; he sews Lindsays's mouth to Katsuro's anus, and Jenny's mouth to Lindsay's anus. This means when he feeds Katsuro food, Katsuro will go to the toilet in Lindsay's mouth, and Lindsay will go to the toilet in Jenny's mouth. 

The doctor calls his victims his 'human centipede', and he tries to train his centipede as a pet. However, the doctor becomes very annoyed when he is kept awake by the screaming of his victims, and even more annoyed when Jenny starts to get ill from blood poisoning. 

When the police visit the doctor to look for the missing people, the doctor decides to add them to his centipede and get rid of Jenny. The doctor tries but fails to drug the detectives, and they leave the house saying they will come back later. The three try to escape, and Katsuro attacks the doctor, but they do not escape the house. Katsuro tells the doctor that he deserves his fate, because he had treated his family very badly in the past, then he kills himself with a piece of glass. The police come back to the house and search it, as the doctor hides near his swimming pool. One policeman finds the 'human centipede' but then hears a gunshot which he goes to investigate. He discovers the other policeman dead in the swimming pool. The doctor then shoots him in the stomach, and as he is dying he shoots the doctor in the head. The policeman then falls in the pool and is dead. 

Jenny and Lindsay hold hands as Jenny dies from her blood poisoning. Lindsay is left alone in the house. She is still stuck to the other two.

Most reviews said "The Human Centipede" was not very good. However some Horror blogs liked the idea and thought it was funny.

The movie won some awards at Film Festivals.

Template:Infobox protected area/doc

This template is part of the .
These selected fields can be used to form a completely functional Infobox. The template can be pasted into a new article. See below for working examples.

This table describes all fields which can be used in building infoboxes. Only the codice_1 field is required.

Depending on the value of the codice_2 field, one of the following banners will be displayed below the name. Valid values are Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V and VI. For more information read the World Commission on Protected Areas article,

Any image of a map showing the location of the protected area can be used. There are two mechanisms by which maps using a marker can be displayed. 

First the x and y coordinates in pixels must be found based on a map with a width of 288 pixels. Use the upper left hand corner as the origin. The sub-template uses these special coordinates to superimpose the marker on the map image showing the location of the protected area.

The maximum and default display width is 283 pixels but smaller maps can be displayed by setting codice_5 to a different value.

Yosemite National Park is located at codice_6 from the left of the image and codice_7 from the top. You can experiment by pasting this example code into a and substituting your own values. A tutorial will be prepared shortly.

A marker can be superimposed on one of a set of special map templates. If values for codice_3 and codice_9 are not specified and geographical coordinates are specified without the use of the template then a marker will be superimposed on the map selected from a set of map templates. These maps can be found at . All of the names begin with the words "Location map" followed by the area covered. The name you need to specify is the area name. The map template for the for Alberta, Canada is . In this case specify codice_10. For example:

The maps in this template set for large areas use equirectangular projection. Large scale maps look different using this projection than those with which most are familiar. Most maps use some other method of projection. Compare the two maps bellow. The second uses equirectangular projection.

For technical reasons it is much easier for the template to use the second map. The distortion of the of the 49th parallel north which defines most of the US–Canadian border can be clearly seen. If the first map were to be used the marker would not appear in the proper location. With maps of smaller areas this difference is less critical. If you want to use larger maps consider using the XY method.

Coordinates can be entered as decimal digits or using degrees, minutes and seconds. There is also the option of using the template but this is not recommended since it does not allow for map functionality. If no map is to be displayed then the Coord template will work fine.

The coord template can be used with the following syntax. More information can be found at .

For additional examples see .

The coordinates for Canadian places can be found using Geographical Name Search Service (GNSS). Coordinates for United States places can be found using Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). Another tool that will supply coordinates for many locations around the world can be found at univers immedia which uses Google Maps. These sites and many others provide coordinates using decimal degreess which are used in the example above. Using decimal degrees simplifies data entry and accuracy. By default the coordinates are displayed in degree, minute, second format. This is being considered. This can be changed by setting .

The HTML mark up produced by this template includes an hCard microformat, which makes the area name and location parsable by computers, either acting automatically to catalogue article across Wikipedia, or via a browser tool operated by a person, to (for example) add the subject to an address book. Within the hCard is a Geo microformat, which additionally makes the coordinates (latitude & longitude) parsable, so that they can be, say, looked up on a map, or downloaded to a GPS unit. For more information about the use of microformats on Wikipedia, please visit .

Mare Tranquillitatis is a large area on the visible side of the Moon. It is also called the Sea of Tranquillity. It is called a sea because ancient astronomers looked at the Moon and thought they saw seas and oceans on the Moon. Now we know that they are not seas. They are darkened areas on the Moon's surface. They may have been made by ancient volcanoes by things such as leaks and eruptions. Mare Tranquillitatis is just one of the 22 "Seas" and "Oceans" on the Moon.

Heterodontosauridae

Heterodontosauridae ("different-toothed lizards") is a family of early ornithischian dinosaurs.

They have often been considered basal ornithopods, although recent studies suggest they may have been more closely related to marginocephalians. Although their fossils are rare, they lived around the globe beginning in the Upper Triassic and may have persisted into the Lower Cretaceous.

A large gap, called a diastema, separated the premaxillary teeth from the those of the maxilla (the main upper jaw bone) in many ornithischia, but this diastema was arched in heterodontosaurs. 

The mandible (lower jaw) was tipped by the predentary, a bone unique to ornithischia. This bone also supported a beak similar to the one found on the premaxilla. All the teeth in the lower jaw were found on the dentary bone.

Heterodontosaurids are named for their strongly heterodont teeth. There were three premaxillary teeth. In the early Jurassic "Abrictosaurus", "Heterodontosaurus", and "Lycorhinus", the first two premaxillary teeth were small and conical, while the much larger third tooth resembled the canines of carnivoran mammals and is often called the caniniform or 'tusk'.

Stephen James Strasburg (born July 20, 1988 in San Diego, California) is an American baseball player. He is a pitcher for the Washington Nationals in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played baseball in college at San Diego State University. While playing at San Diego State, Strasburg threw a no hitter against the Air Force Acadamy. The Nationals drafted him with the first pick in the 2009 MLB Draft. Strasburg signed a contract to play for the Nationals for four years while being paid more than 15 million dollars. After signing his contract, Strasburg began pitching in the minor leagues. Most people did not expect Strasburg to stay in the minor leagues for very long, though. Strasburg played very well in the minor leagues. His earned run average (ERA) for the Syracuse Chiefs, which was the final minor league team he played for, was only 1.08.

Strasburg played his first game in Major League Baseball on June 8, 2010. The game had sold out just a few hours after the Nationals said that Strasburg would play on that day. He was the Nationals' starting pitcher in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Strasburg pitched for 7 innings, striking out 14 Pirates batters, giving up 2 runs, and only allowing 4 hits. The Nationals won the game by a score of 5-2.

The Neoptera can be contrasted with the Palaeoptera, the 'ancient-winged' insects, which include the Odonata, the Ephemeroptera and extinct groups such as the Palaeodictyoptera.

Endopterygota

The Endopterygota (or Holometabola), are insects of the subclass Pterygota.

They have complete metamorphosis. This means they go through different larval, pupal, and adult stages. The larval and adult stages differ very much in their anatomy and behavior. This is called holometabolism, or complete metamorphism.

They are distinguished from the Exopterygota (or Hemipterodea) by the way in which their wings develop. Endopterygota ("internal winged forms") develop wings inside the body during metamorphosis.

The earliest endopterygote fossils date from the Carboniferous.

The Vienna Declaration was a statement to reinforce the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Charter. This led to the starting of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. It was adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993.

The main principle is that "all human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated." (Part I para 5) This means that the international community must treat all matters about human rights equallly and with the same importance without exceptions. This phase is cited also by Declaration of Montreal, Yogyakarta Principles and Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

Nihon Odai Ichiran

According to the 1871 edition of the "American cyclopaedia," a translation of "Nihon Ōdai Ichiran" ("Annales des empereurs du japon") in 1834 was one of very few books about Japan; and it was written by one of the main writers about Japan up to that time.

Dutch historian Isaac Titsingh brought the seven volumes of the book with him when he returned to Europe in 1797. He returned after twenty years in Asia. The books were lost in the Napoleonic Wars. Titsingh's French translation was published after his death.

This was the first major history of Japan to be published in the West. It was also the first history book by a Japanese writer to be published in Europe.

Isaac Titsingh described "Nihon odai ichiran" as very dry. He thought that the translation was "a most tedious task."

Strong Bad

Strong Bad is one of the major characters of the "Homestar Runner" series of animated Flash web cartoons. He is portrayed by Matt Chapman, the principal voice actor and co-founder of the series. Strong Bad enjoys pranking the other characters of the series, along with his ever-diligent lackey pet named "The Cheat" and his older brother Strong Mad. The main segment that Strong Bad is a part of is ""Strong Bad Email"", in which he answers emails sent to him by fans. "Strong Bad Email" has turned into several DVDs, as well as a podcast, since its first episode in 2001.

Strong Bad is sometimes referred to as the main antagonist of the series due to his pranks that he, Strong Mad, and The Cheat play on the other characters, and his insulting of his brother Strong Sad. He seems to be a character influenced by the American popular culture trends of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, 
such as heavy metal music and the second and third generations of video games and video game consoles. Since he is one of the site's most popular characters, merchandise has also spun off of Strong Bad, which includes t-shirts and sweatshirts sold by the website.

Strong Bad has been one of the series most popular characters, and has been well received. In an article by National Review Online, Strong Bad was described as "a non-stop braggart, liar, manipulator, and egotist", but also "one of the coolest characters on the Internet and the real star of Homestarrunner.com, which may be the most popular homegrown animation in the world". Segments have been spun off of his emails, including "Teen Girl Squad" a comic drawn by Strong Bad about four teenage friends.

Old Style and New Style dates

Old Style (or O.S.) and New Style (or N.S.) are used in English language historical studies either to show that the start of the Julian year has been changed to start on 1 January (NS) even though some papers use a different start of year (OS). They can also be used to show that a date uses the Julian calendar (OS). The Julian calendar was used in many countries, rather than the Gregorian calendar (NS). The Latin words for O.S. are "stili veteris" or "stilo vetere". They are used all around the world. They can be shortened to "st.v" and translatd as "(of) old style".

The Gregorian calendar replaced the Julian in Catholic countries beginning in 1582.

The Clarence S. Campbell Bowl is a National Hockey League (NHL) trophy awarded to the Western Conference playoff champions. The trophy is named for Clarence S. Campbell to honor his work for the NHL. He was the president of the NHL from 1946 to 1977. The trophy is a made of sterling silver. It was made by a British silversmith in 1878. 

The trophy was first awarded in 1968 to the regular-season champions of the West Division. Starting in 1975, the trophy was awarded to the regular-season winner of the Campbell Conference. Starting in 1982, the trophy was awarded to the playoff champion in the Campbell Conference. Since 1994, the trophy has been awarded to the playoff champion in the Western Conference.

A traditional supersitition that is prevalent among many of today's NHL players is that no player should either touch or lift the Campbell (Western Conference champion) or Prince of Wales (Eastern Conference champion) Trophies after they have won the conference playoffs; the players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus it should be the only trophy that they should be hoisting.

Vuvuzela

A vuvuzela is a blowing horn used in soccer games in South Africa. They are also called lepatas or a stadium horn. To blow this horn, the lip and lung strength of the blower has to be strong to make a sound like a foghorn or an elephant.

The "vuvuzela" was originally made out of tin. It became very popular in South Africa in the 1990s. A fan of the Kaizer Chiefs FC named Freddie "Saddam" Maake says that he invented the vuvuzela. He got the idea from the aluminium 1965 bicycle horn, and after taking off the black rubber, he blew it. After that, he thought it was too short, and so he joined a pipe to make it longer. He has kept photos of himself in South African soccer games holding the aluminium vuvuzela. He says the instrument was not allowed to be used because it was thought of as a dangerous weapon. Because of this, he tried to find a plastic company that could make it safer. 

In 2001, South Africa-based company Masincedane Sport began to sell the plastic version. Neil van Schalkwyk, the co-owner of Masincedane Sport, won the SAB KickStart Award in 2001.

Vuvuzelas have been said to be rooted in African history, but this is argued between many historians. South African people used to blow on a kudu horn to call villagers to a meeting. Also, there is a South African saying that "A baboon is killed by a lot of noise." Similar horns have been made for a long time by many people. A horn that looks identical to a vuvuzela is seen in Winslow Homer's woodcut "The Dinner Horn" from the 1870's.

In the 2010 World Cup, vuvuzelas were in the news all over the world because it was normal in South Africa for them to be blown at football matches. The world football governing body, FIFA, did not want to allow the use of vuvuzelas. This was because they were afraid that might use the instrument as a weapon and that businesses could put advertisements on vuvuzelas. However the South African Football Association (SAFA) said that vuvuzelas were important for South African games, and FIFA decided in July 2008 to let the instruments be used. 

Some football players and audiences did not like the vuvuzelas. The Lee Dixon of the BBC Three said that the sounds were "quite ". The European broadcasters also complained to the FIFA that they could not hear the commentators because of the sound.

Vuvuzelas have also caused problems. With a Vuvuzela, high sound pressure levels can be reached. These are about 120 dB(A) at a distance of one metre, and about 191 db(A) next to the instrument. There have been moves to prohibit the use of vuvuzelas in certain public viewing areas, because they can damage hearing, and because their sound may be louder than that of emergency broadcasts. Demand for earplugs to protect from hearing loss during the World Cup was bigger than the available supply. Many pharmacies ran out of stock. Neil van Schalkwyk, manufacturer of the plastic vuvuzela, began selling earplugs to fans.. After the World Cup 2010 vuvuzelas started to be banned in other countries. In Britain Tottenham Hotspur was the first football team to ban them in July 2010, and many other football teams have since followed. They were banned because of health and saftey reasons, especially because it was said that people might not hear any safety announcements.

Web accessibility

Web accessibility is how easy it is to use the internet for people with disabilities. 

This can be different types of disabilities. For example, websites might have important information in a sound file with somebody reading it out loud, which would make it possible for people who are blind or who have trouble seeing to get the information. Another way of making a website more accessible would be to remove an image with flashing lights, because such images could give some people seizures.

Brachiosauridae

Brachiosauridae are a family of sauropod dinosaurs, whose members are known as brachiosaurids. They were herbivorous quadrupeds with longer forelegs than hind legs. As a result, there is also some dispute about which animals belong within this family.

The largest mounted skeleton in the world is a brachiosaurid the Giraffatitan brancai (formerly "Brachiosaurus brancai") at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany.

Brachiosaurids first evolved in the Middle Jurassic period, and died out at the end of the Early Cretaceous period, existing for about 60 million years. The earliest known brachiosaurid is "Lapparentosaurus" from the Middle Jurassic of Africa. The giant "Sauroposeidon" from North America was one of the last brachiosaurids, existing just before the end of the Early Cretaceous period. 

The name "brachiosaurid" means "arm lizard", which may sound like a strange name for a four-legged animal. The family Brachiosauridae was given this name because the dinosaurs in it tended to have longer "arms" (front legs) than back legs.

Brachiosaurids have been featured in many works of popular culture, particulary the type genus, "Brachiosaurus". "Brachiosaurus" was featured in the 1993 film "Jurassic Park", as well as the 2000 Disney film "Dinosaur". The brachiosaurid "Astrodon" is the state dinosaur of Maryland. It was featured in paleontologist Robert T. Bakker's novel Raptor Red, where it was portrayed as a prey item of the dromaeosaurid "Utahraptor".

Giraffatitan

Giraffatitan (meaning "giraffe titan") is a genus of sauropod dinosaurs that lived during the late Jurassic Period about 140 million years ago. It was one of the largest animals known to have walked the earth.

Giraffatitans were about tall and weighed about . They had very long necks and looked like giraffes. They lived in Tanzania in an area called Tendaguru.

It was first named as an African species of "Brachiosaurus" ("B. brancai") in 1914 by Werner Janensch because some dinosaurs found in the same area looked like it. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul said that there were some differences between the "Brachiosaurus brancai" and the North American "Brachiosaurus", so he created a subgenus called "Brachiosaurus (Giraffatitan) brancai". In 1991, George Olshevsky said there were enough differences to make its own genus, creating "Giraffatitan".

Matthew

The Matthew was a caravel sailed by John Cabot in 1497 from Bristol to North America, presumably Newfoundland. After a voyage which had got no further than Iceland, Cabot left again with only one vessel, the "Matthew", a small ship (50 tons), but fast and able. The crew consisted of only 18 people. The "Matthew" departed either 2 May or 20 May 1497. She sailed to Dursey Head (latitude 51°36N), Ireland, from where she sailed due west, expecting to reach Asia. However, landfall was reached in North America on 24 June 1497. His precise landing-place is a matter of much controversy, with Cape Bonavista or St. John's in Newfoundland the most likely sites.

Template:Infobox ship begin/doc

This ship infobox supports a very large number of fields, including some specialty fields that will rarely be used. Some fields simply don't make sense in some cases. Some different sets of code have been prepared using only the most common fields. Select the most appropriate set below and copy and paste the entire code to the top of a ship article, then fill in as many fields as possible. Empty fields should generally be kept so that a future editor can fill them in unless they make no sense for the ship in question.

The "Full" code contains every field the template supports. If you want, you can copy one of the the simplified sets of code and add a few fields from the "Full" code.

If you have ideas for improvements or would like to add brand new fields to these templates, please post on to discuss the changes and how they should be implemented.

For infoboxes of individual ships, please copy the appropriate example for the kind of ship:

If none of the above fit, you may use this full setup:

Most fields are self-explanatory, but here are some tips:

Some fields provide alternate spellings and should never both be filled in:


It's generally a good idea not to remove fields, because another editor might be able to provide the information later. However, in the case of mutually exclusive fields, like "Ship armor" and "Ship armour", the unused field can be removed if desired. Also, if a section is repeated (to show multiple periods in commission, for example), fields that are inappropriate to duplicate can be removed if desired.

This infobox allows you to repeat sections. To repeat, just make a copy of the section to be repeated. You can repeat the Image, Career, or Characteristics sections. Here is an example, with extra fields removed for clarity:

It is possible to hide the headers for the Career and General Characteristics sections, in order to repeat fields. For example, a ship might have been commissioned, decommissioned, recommissioned, and decommissioned again. To have the second commission and decommission dates, use additional a second Infobox ship career template with its header hidden, like this:

The General Characteristics section can be given a caption using the Header caption field. See the USS Wisconsin example above, which has a header caption of (1943) to indicate that the characteristics provided are as of 1943.

It is possible to add custom fields to the infobox using standard . This is not encouraged, because infoboxes are intended to standardize the appearance of ship articles, but it can be done if needed. See the below example, where "Sunk:" and "Raised:" fields are added to the ship's career:

Object (grammar)

An object in grammar is the target of an action, and occurs in any sentence with a transitive verb. It is an element in the clause which follows the verb, as in:
These are direct objects. The following are indirect objects:
The structure of these sentences is (S/V/O/O) where S = subject, V = verb and O = object. The first object is an "indirect object", the second is a "direct object". Notice that, in the last example, you sent a letter, not your son. The sentence makes perfect sense without the indirect object.

An equivalent sentence to the last example is:
Here some grammarians also see "son" as the indirect object ("letter" is the term which cannot be left out).

<doc id="249308" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=249308" title="Subject (grammar)">
Subject (grammar)

The subject in grammar is the agent (the 'doer') in an active sentence such as: "Alan kissed Jane".

However, there is a difficulty. The following two sentences are identical in meaning:
Only in the first sentence is "our children" the grammatical subject. So there is a difference between the logical subject and the grammatical subject. Also, many sentences have no subject, for instance:

If a sentence does have a subject, then the rest of the sentence may be called the "predicate".

Frigate

A frigate () is a warship. The term has been used for warships of many sizes and roles for a few centuries. During the age of sail they were small, agile ships that were extensively used in the American War of Independence, and later against the British. Their main use was shore defense.

In the modern day the term "Frigate" covers a broad range of ships. This is primarily for political reasons. The generally accepted term is of a warship less that 6, 000 dwt and greater that around 2, 000 dwt. Its primary purpose is usually anti-submarine warfare. It can also be a long range patrol vessel or in smaller navies an anti-air vessel.

Eugène Gigout

Eugène Gigout (23 March 1844 – 9 December 1925) was a French organist and composer of European late-romantic music for organ.

Gigout was born in Nancy, and died in Paris.

A student of Camille Saint-Saëns, he served as the organist of Saint-Augustin Church in Paris for 62 years. He became known as a teacher and his output as a composer was good. Renowned as an expert improviser, he also founded his own music school. His nephew-by-marriage, Leon Boëllmann, became another fine organist and composer for the organ. He died at the very young age of 35.

The "10 pièces pour orgue", composed in 1890, are Gigout's most famous compositions. They are the "Toccata in B minor", his best-known composition, which turns up as a common encore at organ concerts. Also often played, and to be found in the same collection, is a "Scherzo in E major". Other famous compositions by Gigout are "Grand Choeur Dialogué" and "Marche Religieuse". Gigout's works are now available on many commercial recordings.

The distinction only applies where the verb is transitive, since only a transitive verb comes with an object. For example: "We enjoyed the trip" is transitive and in active voice. "The trip was enjoyed by us" is transitive and in passive voice. "She hurried home" is not transitive and so has no voice. But if "she hurried the children home", that's transitive and active voice.

Desert scorpion

A desert scorpion is an arachnid ("uH- raK- nid".) An arachnid is an insect that has eight legs two body parts, an abdomen and a cepholothorax.

The desert scorpion has pale yellow legs, tail, and claws and a black back. The tail is joined to the abdomen. The legs and head are also joined to the abdomen.

Many body parts are joined to the cephalothorax, such as the eyes, and the pincers. Their claws are at the bottom of their legs. They have two eyes and a median eye above it.

The desert scorpion’s habitat is the desert. It is a warm place where the hottest days can reach 120 degrees. Desert scorpions range is south west. In extreme weather conditions, the extra layer of fat under scorpion’s exoskeleton helps it to survive. It lives in sandy places in the desert like sand dunes.

The desert scorpion eats at night and hides at day. It eats insects such as spiders, and beetles. It’s predators are baboons, snakes, lizards, lionss and bears

There are more than 600 species of scorpions. Scorpions and Spiders are related they both belong to the arachnid family and they both have eight legs. Large scorpions live in tropical forests. Scorpions can dance by grabbing one another’s pincers so they don’t get hurt. With pincers held they both move back and forth and side ways.

Black widow

Black widows are spiders. Their scientific name is "Latrodectus mactans," and they share the "Latrodectus" name with several similar spiders (sometimes called "widow spiders). They are shiny black, have round abdomens with a red hourglass pattern on its underside. They are closely related to another group called "Steotoda" (sometimes called "false widow spiders) that contains species that are not dangerous to humans. All of the true widow spiders can give bites that are harmful to human beings and may kill children or people who are not in good health.

Female widow spiders are rather large,having a body length of approximately 0.5 inch. The males of the widow spiders are very much smaller than the females. 

Both the widow spiders and the "Steotoda" spiders belong to a larger group that includes very many kinds of spiders that make similar kinds of webs and have the same general body shape. But those spiders are not shiny black and often prefer to build their webs in sunny places. 

Black widow spiders live in warm places all over the world. They like to build their webs in safe places under something like an overturned box sitting on the ground. Often they are found under the seats of outdoor toilets. They like to be left alone, so they rarely come inside places where people live. 

Like other spiders, Black widows bite for two reasons: to kill things to eat and to protect themselves. They catch flying insects in their webs and bite them so that they will stop fighting to get free. When people put their hands into this spider's web they might get bitten by mistake, but usually people get bitten when they squeeze a spider and the spider defends itself. Unfortunately for us, humans are very sensitive to the venom that the spider gives in its bite. The good thing is that Widow spiders will almost always run away if they can. If something big hits their web then they will drop straight down to the ground and run away.

Black widows eat flies, moths, and anything else that flies or falls into their webs and that is not big enough to escape.

Pill bug

Armadillidiidae is a family of woodlice, a terrestrial crustacean group in the order Isopoda. Pill bugs are not insects, but are crustaceans. Crustaceans are animals with hard shells made from many pieces for protection.
Pill bugs look like gray pills. The pill bug’s abdomen has seven segments. Pill bugs have flat bodies. The pill bug has three basic body parts called the head, thorax, and abdomen, and they can be many sizes.
The head has eyes (simple and compound) and a mouth. Pill bugs have two sets of antenna. One of the sets is visible to see. The thorax holds the legs. The abdomen holds the exopods of uropods is attached to some crustaceans’ abdomen. Pillbugs eat rotten vegetables.

Druze

The Druze are an Arabic-speaking people of the Middle East. 

There are more than 500,000 Druze. About half of them live in the Hauran districts of Syria. Most of the rest live in Lebanon and about 40,000 live in Israel. Some have emigrated to the United States and Canada. 

The Druze practice a religion related to Islam and Christianity but more based on philosophy. Al-Hakim, a ruler of Egypt during the 11th century sponsored the religion which was created by Hamza bin Ali. The name Druze probably comes from Darazi, a preacher who was expelled from the Druze movement, because he preached that Al-Hakim was literally God. 

The Druze in Lebanon had a major political influence and where the rulers of Lebanon before the 1860s after the 1860s they shared the ruling of mount Lebanon with the Maronites and were later considered the 4th major religious sect after independence. They played a key role in fighting against the Lebanese Christian right during the early 1980s. The Druze ended their fighting against the Lebanese Christian right in late 1990. In 1990 and 1991, they gained representation in Lebanon's government in accordance with a 1989 peace agreement.

Ready to Fall

"Ready to Fall" is the first single by melodic hardcore band Rise Against from their fourth studio album, "The Sufferer & The Witness" (2006).

An acoustic version of this song was done live on the CJZN Radio station in Victoria, British Columbia, on January 18, 2007, before a Billy Talent concert featuring Rise Against, Anti-Flag, and Moneen.

On March 12, 2009, the song became a downloadable song in the video game, "Guitar Hero World Tour". It is also shown in Tap Tap Revenge 3 on the iPhone and iPod Touch as a downloadable double song pack with Audience of One. The song was also shown in 2009 action movie 12 Rounds.

The video was made in 2006. It is about pollution and its effects on the environment. The video is 3 minutes and 52 seconds long. It cuts between shots of the band playing and shots of animals being saved or dying, if not already dead. This is from many environmental dangers made by humans. At the end of the video, lead singer Tim McIlrath says, ""Every action has a reaction. We've got one planet, one chance.""

There was also a version played on television. There are also ones that are more graphic. This was never really released. But it is available on some websites. The video serves a testimony to veganism. Rise Against is an active supporter of PETA, a animal rights organization, and the band members are all active vegetarians.

The song got to number 13 on the "Billboard" Modern Rock Tracks chart. It is the lowest charting single from "The Sufferer & the Witness". Although, it was the band's second highest charting single.

Acacia is a genus of shrub or tree are belonging to the subfamily Mimosoideae of the family Fabaceae, first described in Africa by the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus in 1773. Many non-Australian species tend to be thorny, whereas the majority of Australian Acacias are not. 

Acacias are heavily defended against herbivores. Different species have different combinations of defences:

Products from the Acacia have often been used for medicinal purposes.

Various species of acacia yield gum. True gum arabic is the product of "Acacia senegal", abundant in dry tropical West Africa from Senegal to northern Nigeria.

"Acacia arabica" is the gum-Arabic tree of India, but yields a gum inferior to the true gum-Arabic.

Horizontal and vertical writing

Horizontal and vertical writing are two ways of writing.

Documents around the world have many different ways of writing. But there are mainly two ways of writing: writing horizontally (횡서, 橫書) or vertically (종서縱書). There are two kinds of horizontal writing. One kind can be read from left to right (좌횡서, 左橫書); the other is read from right to left (우횡서, 右橫書). There are two kinds of vertical writing as well: from left to right (좌정서, 左縱書) or from right to left (우정서, 右縱書). Traditionally, the countries in the Sinosphere (such as Korea, China, Japan or Vietnam) write vertically from right to left. When it was necessary to write horizontally, they wrote horizontally from right to left. When the Western culture began influencing them, they began writing horizontally from left to right, which is now used widely. Today, letters that can be written both horizontally and vertically are not common.

Most Western languages are written horizontally from left to right, but Arabian and Hebrew are written horizontally from right to left. Mongol letters are written horizontally from left to right.

Long ago, people used hieroglyphs. Hieroglyphs were very flexible letters. They were often written from left to right in the first line, and then right to left in the second line, and so on. This is called boustrophedon.

Neoclassicism in music was popular in the twentieth-century. Mostly between the two World Wars. This kind of music is when composers try to come back to beautiful ways with the broadly defined way of "classicism", namely order, balance, clarity, economy, and emotions. Neoclassicism had two distinct national lines of development. They were French and German. Neoclassicsim was a beautiful trend rather than a movement. Many composers normally do not think of themselves as "neoclassicists." But some really do have some elements of the style.

Paul Marie Theodore Vincent d'Indy (27 March 18512 December 1931) was a French composer and music teacher. Born in Paris, he was encouraged to learn music by his uncle who had studied with César Franck. D'Indy later also studied with Franck at the Paris Conservatoire. He liked the music of Lizst, Beethoven and Wagner. He went to the first performance of Wagner's "Ring" at Bayreuth in 1876. He organized performances of works by Rameau and Monteverdi whose work had been mostly forgotten. He was a very conservative in his views on music, and after his proposed changes to the Conservatoire were ignored, he set up his own music school, the Schola Cantorum in 1894.

He wrote a large number of musical compositions including operas, overtures, symphonies, choral works, piano works, string sextets, string quartets, folk song arrangements, and a cello sonata. One of his well known works is the "Symphonie sur un Chant Montagnard Français" (1886) ("Symphony on a French Mountain Song"). 

He also wrote books including a biography of César Franck, and a book on how to write music.

Varèse's music has an emphasis on timbre and rhythm. He made up the term "organized sound." This phrase means that some timbres and rhythms can be grouped together. Although his finished works only last about three hours, he has been thought as an influence by many big composers of the late 20th century. His use of new instruments and electronic resources led to his being known as the "Father of Electronic Music" while Henry Miller described him as "The stratospheric Colossus of Sound".

<doc id="249457" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=249457" title="Conservapedia">
Conservapedia

Conservapedia is a wiki designed for people who are conservative Christians. It was created by Andrew Schlafly. Conservapedia is a reaction to what its creators see as a "liberal point of view" in Wikipedia. Conservapedia has articles on many things, but most of the site is about politics and religion. It also has lectures and other materials for students, and classes taught by Mr. Schlafly for free. All articles are written from a conservative point of view dominant in the United States of America. Conservapedia has some different ideas on community. They have Administrators who have the most power. Users cannot edit at nighttime in the U.S. (because of vandalism), upload images, or do other things they could do at most wikis. Users are granted these rights and can also earn the right to block other users.

Conservapedia was founded by lawyer Andrew Schlafly because of what he felt was liberal bias in Wikipedia. He did this with his homeschooled World History class after one of his students used Common Era dating methods instead of his preferred Anno Domini ones.

Unlike Wikipedia, anonymous people are not allowed to contribute to Conservapedia. They have to create accounts that should be using part of their real names (such as the preferred real first name and last initial setup). Edits should follow the site's conservative, Christian point of view. Administrators control every aspect of the site and have the final say in editorial authority. People, who are called vandals, often come to Conservapedia to mess up the pages because they do not agree with the site's point of view. People are often unfairly banned for making minor mistakes.

Conservapedia has a part of the site where editors rewrite the Bible to remove "liberal bias" from modern versions. They claim that the New International Version of the Bible is written at the seventh-grade level and that it has politically correct language. Critics say that it is not good to rewrite the Bible and say it was bad for them to remove Jesus' prayer in Luke 23:34 and the adulteress story.

Schlafly got into an argument with Michigan State University researcher Richard Lenski over his twenty-year experiment with e.coli samples he used to show evolution occurring. Schlafly mailed Lenski asking for the results. Lenski responded by redirecting Schlafly to his paper on the subject. Schlafly (who did not read the paper) asked for the evidence and Lenski refused to hand him the samples since he did not have the expertise. Conservapedians got in a campaign criticizing Lenski.

Critics use this as a way to show how ignorant they think Conservapedia is.

Conservapedia has had some bad reactions from people who think that it is untrue. It has also been criticized for supporting some ideas such as creationism.

A site called RationalWiki was created to criticize Conservapedia, and some editors of that site decided that they wanted to vandalize or destroy Conservapedia.

Two other sites, A Storehouse of Knowledge, and Ameriwiki were created as alternatives to Conservapedia.

The Bible Retranslation project has come under criticism by people who feel it is wrong to change God's word.

Text grammar

A text grammar is the study of texts above the level of the sentence. It shows how texts are put together so as to convey ideas, facts, messages, and fiction. 

A similar term is discourse analysis. Both are mostly concerned with natural language use; discourse analysis would include spoken language. Speech is also the parent of rhetoric, the ancient study of persuasive speaking. In a similar way, literary criticism parallels text grammar, because both concentrate on the printed word. A text grammar approach puts emphasis on the linguistic structure of a text, rather than its cultural or symbolic meaning.

A text is a coherent body of sentences. Coherent means they are linked by a consistent "theme". The text ends when "completion" is signalled. For example, when a problem introduced at the start is solved, or when a promised discussion has reached a conclusion. 

Each text focuses on certain things. If text are grouped by what they are doing, then there are five basic text types:
Many texts, of course, can and do have a mixture of two or more of these types.

Discourse analysis

Discourse analysis is a subject which studies a text or a conversation. This is a subject in linguistics which does not study sentences, like in syntax, but the entire text or conversation. The text or conversation is known as discourse. Discourse analyst prefer to use real life discourse in their studies, rather than invented sentences like in traditional linguistics. This way of studying real life discourse is called corpus linguistics. 

Discourse analysis is related to text linguistics. However, text linguistics studies how discourse is structured so that they are connected (how sentences are joined to each other). Discourse analysis studies this, and also how the discourse is connected to the context. This context includes who the people talking or writing are, the social and cultural context. Also, it studies the way mode, which is the way the language is represented (is it a letter, speech, email, Internat chat?), influences discourse. Discourse analysis is also interested in the genre (topic) of the discourse. 

Discourse analysis is studied not only in linguistics, but also in sociology, anthropology, psychology, communication studies and translation studies.

Aphaenogaster

Aphaenogaster is a genus of myrmicine ants. Almost 200 species have been described. Also, 11 fossil species are known. They live worldwide except from South America and Southern Africa. 

They are often confused with "Pheidole" or "Pheidologeton". These two have major and minor workers, while "Aphaenogaster" has only a single worker caste. "Pheidole" has a 3-segmented club on its antenna. But "Aphaenogaster" has four segments and a larger body size. "Pheidologeton" has a 11-segmented antenna, while the antenna in "Aphaenogaster" is 12-segmented.

They make very thick, easily seen nests with many big entrances in a small place. These entrances can have diameters of up to 4 cm and are up to 30 cm deep. This resulted in their common name funnel ants. These nests can be a bad problem for golfers or on pastures and unsealed airstrips, because the fragile ground easily breaks under pressure.

"Aphaenogaster" gets most of its food from tended aphids on the roots of plants. This explains that they are not commonly seen out of their tunnels. The funnel-shaped openings could play a role in trapping arthropods, which are also eaten.

Although these ants are not aggressive, they will bite when their nest is disturbed.

Der Wanderer

Der Wanderer is the name of a Lied composed by Franz Schubert in October 1816 for voice and piano. The words are taken from a German poem by Georg Philipp Schmidt von Lübeck. The lied is set in the key of C-sharp minor with the tempo marking "sehr langsam" (very slow) and the time signature alla breve. The piece has a total of 72 measures. Schubert wrote another lied entitled "Der Wanderer;" it is numbered D.649.

The song begins with a recitative, describing the setting: mountains, a steaming valley, the roaring sea. The wanderer is strolling quietly, unhappily, and asks, sighing, the question: "where?"

The next section, consisting of 8 bars of a slow melody sung in pianissimo, describes the feelings of the wanderer: He feels that he is a stranger everywhere. This 8 bar section was later used by Schubert as theme for the second movement of the "Wanderer Fantasy".

Next the music shifts to the key of E major, the tempo increases and the time signature changes to 6/8. The wanderer asks: "where are you my beloved land?" This place the wanderer longs for is described as green with hope, "the land where my roses bloom, my friends stroll, my dead rise" and, finally, "the land which speaks my language, Oh land, where are you?" Towards the end of this section, the music gets quite animated and forms the climax of the song.

Finally, the music returns to the original minor key and slow tempo. After quoting the question "where?" from the opening, the song closes with a "ghostly breath" finally answering the question: "There where you are not, there is happiness." The song closes in the key of E major.

Life Before Life

Life Before Life is a book written by psychiatrist Jim B. Tucker. It presents an overview of more than 40 years of reincarnation research at the University of Virginia into children's reports of past life memories. 

The book suggests that consciousness can be considered separately from the brain, which provides a basis for claims of reincarnation. "Life Before Life" has been translated into ten languages and the foreword to the book is written by Ian Stevenson.

<doc id="249653" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=249653" title="Ian Stevenson">
Ian Stevenson

Ian Stevenson, M.D., was a Canadian professor of psychiatry. He worked at the University of Virginia, in the area of parapsychology. 

Stevenson thought that the idea of reincarnation might help modern medicine better understand aspects of human behavior and development. He traveled a lot over a period of 40 years to investigate 3,000 childhood cases that suggested to him the possibility of past lives. 
Stevenson saw reincarnation as the survival of the personality after death, although he never suggested a physical process by which a personality might survive death. 

Stevenson's research was the subject of Jim B. Tucker's "Life Before Life" (2005).

Stevenson found that the best evidence supporting the belief in reincarnation comes from the cases of young children who, typically between the ages of 2 and 5, make statements about a previous life they claim to have had before being born. Their statements are often accompanied by behaviour that is unusual for their family but appropriate for the life that the child claims to remember. There is often a "forgetting of the imaged memories between the ages of 5 and 8; a high incidence of violent death claimed in the claimed previous life; and mention of the mode of death by the subject".
Some 35 per cent of the subjects have birthmarks or birth defects which often correspond to injuries or illness experienced by the deceased person who the subject remembers. Medical documents have confirmed this correspondence in more than forty cases.

Ian Stevenson authored or co-authored more than a dozen books. Stevenson died in 2007, and many of these books are mentioned in his obituaries in the "British Medical Journal", "New York Times", and the "Washington Post".

Parapsychology

Parapsychology is the study of psychic phenomona. These phenomona involve the exchange of information between a person and their environment, without the use of the five senses. They include extrasensory perception (such as telepathy), influence of mind on matter (psychokinesis), anomalous experiences (such as past life experiences and near death experiences) and apparitions. Such things have been reported for a very long time.

In 2005, Nobel Laureate Brian Josephson said that many scientists are not yet swayed by the evidence for parapsychology and the paranormal. Josephson contends that some scientists feel uncomfortable about ideas such as telepathy and that their emotions sometimes get in the way when making evaluations.

Handedness

Handedness is the preference for using either the left or the right side of the body for certain things. People are described as left-handed or right-handed when they prefer to write with their left or their right hand. They may prefer the use of certain hands for certain tasks.

The scientific name for handedness is laterisation. Laterisation is not only found in humans: it is found in many kinds of animals.

Laterisation is caused because one side of the brain is stronger (more dominant) than the other. The left side of the brain controls the right side of the body and the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body.

Until fairly recently most scientists thought that the reason that humans preferred the left or right sides of their body was because they could speak. Language is controlled by the left side of the brain, so they thought there was a connection between language and laterisation. 

The scientists changed their minds when they found that it was not just humans who have laterisation. Many animals have it, too. For example: elephants often have preferences for whether they swing their trunks to the left or the right. Honeybees have right antennas that are more sensitive to smells. Parrots can be left- or right-footed, and some don’t mind (they are “ambidexterous”). Animals as different as chickens and minnows like to look for food with one eye and look out for predators (animals that might eat them) with the other. This seems to help them to do two things at once.

Andromeda Galaxy

The Andromeda Galaxy is the nearest big galaxy to the Milky Way, our galaxy. Andromeda is sometimes called M31 or NGC 324 by astronomers. It is about 2.5 million light years away from us. 

Andromeda is the largest galaxy of the Local Group, which consists of the Andromeda Galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy, the Triangulum Galaxy, and about 30 other smaller galaxies. Although the largest, Andromeda may not be the most massive. Recent findings suggest that the Milky Way contains more dark matter and may be the most massive in the grouping. 

The 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope revealed that M31 contains a trillion stars (10). This is more than the number of stars in our own galaxy, which is estimated to be c. 200-400 billion.

Andromeda is estimated to be 7.1 solar masses. In comparison, a 2009 study estimated that the Milky Way and Andromeda are about equal in mass, while a 2006 study put the mass of the Milky Way at ~80% of the mass of Andromeda. 

At an apparent magnitude of 3.4, the Andromeda Galaxy is notable for being one of the brightest Messier objects, making it visible to the naked eye on moonless nights even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution. Although it appears more than six times as wide as the full Moon when photographed through a larger telescope, only the brighter central region is visible to the naked eye. Being both large and bright, it is one of the farthest objects that can be seen without a telescope or binoculars.

The Andromeda Galaxy is approaching the Milky Way at about 100 to 140 kilometres per second (62 to 87 mi/s), so it is one of the few blue-shifted galaxies. The Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way are thus expected to collide in perhaps 4.5 billion years. A likely outcome of the collision is that the galaxies will merge to form a giant elliptical galaxy. Such events are frequent among the galaxies in galaxy groups.

The Persian astronomer Abd-al-Rahman Al Sufi was the first man to record seeing the Andromeda Galaxy. He called the Galaxy 'a small cloud' in his book, the "Book of Fixed Stars", which was published in 964 AD. The first person to look at the galaxy with a telescope was Simon Marius in 1612. In Charles Messier put it into his catalogue of astronomical objects. He called it M31 and gave the credit for its discovery to Marius, as he didn't know that Al Sufi had seen it hundreds of years previously. In 1751 William Herschel estimated the distance to the Andromeda 'Nebula' as 'no more than 2000 times the distance to Sirius, or around 17,200 light years. The best modern estimate of Andromeda's distance is 2.54 million light years.

Mechanical bull

A mechanical bull, also known as a Rodeo Bull or Bucking Bronco is a machine that gives the rider sense of riding a bucking animal such as a rodeo bull or horse. 

Its speed can be made faster or slower. Padded flooring is often used around the machine in order to prevent injury to those thrown off it. 
A special motor lets the operator to safely control the ride and safety for the rider; this motor allows the operator to stop the ride before a rider is thrown off the machine. The trained operator at the speed control box controls the unit’s speed as well as spin direction. The equipment has the ability of starting rides very slowly and can be advanced to faster speeds if a rider is able to handle them. It can go slow and simply spin for beginners and run at a more advanced speed for experts or professionals.

Mechanical bulls have been around for decades as a training machine for rodeo riders, as they enable a rider to improve their rodeo performance and skills without the risk. Although mechanical bulls are still used for rodeo training, they are also used as an amusement ride, both as party entertainment and entertainment found in bars, restaurants, and clubs.

As a form of entertainment, the mechanical bull often includes a saddle (even though saddles are not used in real bull riding) and often a model of the head of a bull, complete with horns. One of the earliest uses as a form of entertainment was at Bertrand Island Amusement Park in New Jersey) ,where a mechanical bucking bronco ride was introduced in the 1930s, under the name of "Ride 'Em Cowboy!".
The commercial use of mechanical bulls gained popular appeal with the release of the 1980 movie "Urban Cowboy". In this movie John Travolta and Debra Winger showed the riding a mechanical bull. The mechanical bull used in this movie was the El Toro brand of mechanical bull. This brand of mechanical bull is still being made, but does not carry the same safety features that are available on more current models. Mechanical bulls can also be seen in the films "Stir Crazy", and "". In the movie "Barnyard", in the night barn, a "Mechanical Man" is seen (as the main characters are cows).

In the television show "Strangers with Candy", Jerri Blank's physical education class is uses mechanical bull riding.

A bucking bronco was originally a cowboy term for a horse that jumps about with stiff knees and an arched back.

Shallot

The Shallot ("Allium ascalonicum") is a perennial plant that seldom produces seeds and therefore must be increased by division of its compound bulbs, which is made up of several bulblets or cloves held together at the base.

A sheath as in garlic does not encase the bulbs. The bulblets are planted in the same manner and at the same season, as are onion sets, each set developing into a compound set. The mature bulbs are harvested, cured and stored in the same manner as onions. In suitable storage, the bulbs keep from one season to next. 
The flavor of shallots is somewhat milder than that of onion. The chief use is for flavoring curries; both leaves and cloves are used. Leaves are also consumed as green vegetable. Like their cousin`s onion and garlic this is also considered as non-vegetarian food in India. Most of the crop is produced for sale in the green state, but some dry bulbs are also used. They are also used for pickling.

The Suda or Souda () is a massive 10th century Byzantine encyclopedia of the ancient Mediterranean world. It is an encyclopedic lexicon, written in Greek, with 30,000 entries. The derivation is probably from the Byzantine Greek word "souda", meaning 'fortress' or 'stronghold'.

The "Suda" is somewhere between a grammatical dictionary and an encyclopedia in the modern sense. It explains the source, derivation, and meaning of words according to the philology of its period. There is nothing especially important about this aspect of the work. It is the articles on literary history that are valuable. These entries supply details and quotations from authors whose works are otherwise lost. 

This lexicon represents a convenient work of reference for persons who played a part in political, ecclesiastical, and literary history in the East down to the tenth century. The chief source for this is the encyclopedia of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (912–959), and for Roman history the excerpts of John of Antioch (seventh century).

The work deals with biblical as well as pagan subjects, from which it is inferred that the writer was a Christian. A prefatory note gives a list of dictionaries from which the lexical portion was compiled, together with the names of their authors. The work is uncritical, and probably much added to, and the value of the articles is very unequal. Nevertheless, it contains much information on ancient history and life.

The "Souda" has a near-contemporaneous Islamic parallel, the "Kitab al-Fehrest" of Ibn al-Nadim.

The lexicon is arranged alphabetically with some slight deviations. The letters follow phonetically, in order of sound (of course in the pronunciation of the tenth century, which is similar to that of modern Greek). The system is not difficult to learn and remember, but in some modern editions the work is rearranged alphabetically.

Cockatoo Island (New South Wales)

Cockatoo Island is the largest island in Sydney Harbour in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is at the junction of the Parramatta and Lane Cove rivers. Cockatoo Island has been a prison, industrial school, and reformatory (a prison for boys). It was also the site of one of Australia's biggest shipyards during the 20th century. The first of its two dry docks was built by convicts in 1857. The dockyards closed in 1992.

In March 2005 the island was opened to the public for the 'Cockatoo Island 2005 Festival' Cockatoo Island Festival. The island is now looked after by the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust which wants people to come and visit. The island's history will be a big attraction. There are plans to have the prison buildings made a World Heritage Site, along with other convict sites around Australia. Large workshops, slipways, wharves, houses and other buildings show the island's ship building history.

Cockatoo Island has great views of Sydney Harbour. A campsite opened on the island in 2008. Campers can bring their own tents or hire a tent on the island. The island's views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge make it a popular spot for watching the New Year's Eve fireworks display. More than 2000 campers watched the fireworks in 2009. Two historic dockyard houses can be used as holiday houses.

Ferries going to Woolwich and Balmain, and the Parramatta RiverCat stop at Cockatoo Island. Day visitors can picnic, barbecue, visit the cafe, walk around the island or take an audio or guided tour. Cockatoo Island is open daily and there is no cost to visit.

Regular events and art shows are often held on the island. The island has held the contemporary art show, the Biennale of Sydney, in 2008. More than 80,000 visitors went to the show over 12 weeks. The 2010 Biennale will be also held on the island. Cockatoo Island also had the Sydney Festival's "All Tomorrow's Parties" music festival in January 2009. The two day festival included 24 bands over four stages across the island. The event was organized by Nick Cave, with an audience of over 11,000. The island also held the World's Funniest Island Comedy Festival on a weekend in October 2009. The 200 comedy acts were seen by more than 8,000 people. There are plans to repeat the comedy festival in 2010, and there are plans for future events.

The island is also used for private events both large and small. Part of the movie was filmed there in 2008.

Before the arrival of Europeans, Cockatoo Island was used by the Aboriginal tribes who live in the Sydney area.
In 1839 it was chosen as the site of prison by the Governor of the colony of New South Wales, Sir George Gipps. Between 1839 and 1869 the island was used as a convict prison. The first prisoners came from Norfolk Island. They cut silos into the rock to store the colony's grain supply. By 1842, about 140 tonnes of grain were stored on the island.

One convict on Cockatoo Island was the Australian bushranger, Captain Thunderbolt. He escaped did the crimes which made him famous. His wife had swum across to the island with tools to help him escape. They both swam back to the mainland.

Stone was dug up on the island to build the prison as well as other buildings in Sydney, including the seawall for Circular Quay. Between 1847 and 1857, convicts were used to dig the Fitzroy Dock, Australia’s first dry dock, on the island. 

In 2009, an archeological dig on the island found convict era punishment cells under the cookhouse. These cells give show the conditions convicts lived under on the island.

In 1864 the island was split between the NSW Department of Prisons and the Public Works Department. The dockyard was made larger taking up most of foreshores. In 1869 the convicts were moved to Darlinghurst Gaol. In 1890 the Sutherland Dock, a dry dock large enough to take ships of 20,000 tonnes, was opened.

In 1913 Cockatoo Island become the Commonwealth Naval Dockyard. In 1933 it was leased to the Cockatoo Island Docks and Engineering Company Ltd. During World War II, Cockatoo Island's importance to the Allies increased after Singapore and its shipyards were captured by the Japanese. At least 20 ships were built during the war. The dockyard continued to build both naval and commercial vessels until it closed in 1992.

Important ships built or repaired at dockyard include:

The Light Destroyer (DDL) program was a large project to build ten ships similar to the Royal Navy's Type 21 or Amazon class frigate for Australia during the 1970s and early 1980s. Rising costs saw the original number revised down to five and then three vessels before being stopped altogether in 1972. It was planned that some of these ships would be built at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, but only the Williamstown Naval Dockyard built the ships before the project ended.

From March 25 to March 27, 2005, a music and arts festival was held on the island, using empty buildings and warehouses as exhibition rooms, concert halls and shopping/food venues. Local and international musical groups and artists performed, including:


More than 20,000 people went to the festival. There were more than 120 musical acts, as well as stand-up comedians, performance artists and more. A special ferry service ran day and night to take people to and from the island. The festival did not return to the island in this format and was reborn elsewhere as The Great Escape in 2006.

In 2001, control of Cockatoo Island was given to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust as public, urban park. In 2003 the Harbour Trust completed a Comprehensive Plan for Cockatoo Island and its other sites around Sydney Harbour. The plan proposed making Cockatoo Island a landmark harbour attraction. People would visit the island for sea-based activities, its convict and its ship building history. It would have parklands and spaces for cultural events.

From 18 June to 7 September, Cockatoo Island was used for the Biennale of Sydney, Australia's Festival of Contemporary Art, with 35 artists using buildings and sites across the island to display contemporary art. Over 80,000 visitors attended. The Biennale is being staged on the island in 2010 between 12 May and 1 August.

The island was used in 2009 to shoot an episode from the TV program on the episode 66. The candidates had to make an orienteering race around the island.

Out of body experience

An Out of Body Experience (or OBE) is a big feeling of not being where your body is. It hardly ever happens and does not last very long. It feels like you can see and hear and move to different places or even fly, but all the time your body is sleeping in bed. It feels very strange.

OBEs happen most when you are waking up or going to sleep. They can happen if you nearly die too. That kind of OBE is a Near Death Experience, or NDE. Some people get OBEs during too much marathon running or mountain climbing.

OBEs often work the same way. When they do, they are "classical" OBEs.






Some people say they have "phasing" OBEs too. They just stop noticing the world, remember the easy feeling and start seeing. There is no sleep paralysis so they can sometimes talk about it at the same time.

Most people can see two kinds of place when they have an OBE. Robert Monroe called them Locale I and Locale II, but some people call them the etheric plane and the astral plane.

Locale 1 places look like ordinary places in the world. You might see your bedroom or sleeping body in Locale I. Locale II places are more like dream worlds or heavens.

Some people think OBEs are just dreams, but other people say OBEs don't feel like that. Some people think that when you have an OBE, you're like a ghost and the things you see are real. People who think that sometimes call them 'astral projections'. Some scientists like Sam Parnia are doing tests with hidden pictures in hospitals, to see if ill people really can see them when they have NDEs.

Implication (grammar)

Implication is a grammatical concept. To imply is to suggest something is true without actually saying it. Examples:


Implication is one of a pair of words which go together. When you realise the meaning of the second sentence, and protest "I have never beaten her", you have made an inference. Here is the rule:

Inference always comes after an implication: I imply, then you infer. 

An implication is always verbal, but inferring is not always verbal. A non-verbal response might show the indirect message (implication) had been accurately interpreted (inferred) by the receiver. Example: "I hate you"! may contain unspoken implications, according to circumstance and tone of voice. Between two lovers it might mean:

Nonverbal communication

Nonverbal communication (NVC) is the process of sending and receiving wordless messages. Language is not the only source of communication, there are other means. Much nonverbal communication is subconscious: it happens without thinking about it.
NVC can be communicated through gestures and touch, by body language or posture, by facial expression and eye contact. NVC can be communicated through objects such as clothing and hairstyles. Dance is also a type of nonverbal communication. 

Speech contains nonverbal elements known as paralanguage, including voice quality, emotion and speaking style, as well as prosodic features such as rhythm, intonation and stress. Likewise, written texts have nonverbal elements such as handwriting style, spatial arrangement of words, or the use of emoticons, such as :).

Nonverbal communication has three main aspects: the situation where it takes place, the communicators, and their behavior during the interaction.

Verbal means 'the use of words'. Thus, vocal sounds that are not considered to be words, such as a grunt, or singing a wordless note, are nonverbal. Sign languages and writing are understood as verbal communication, as both make use of words — although like speech, paralinguistic elements do occur alongside nonverbal messages. Nonverbal communication can occur through any sensory channel — sight, sound, smell, touch or taste. NVC is important because:

"When we speak (or listen), our attention is focused on words rather than body language. But our judgement includes both. An audience is simultaneously processing both verbal and nonverbal cues. Body movements are not usually positive or negative in and of themselves; rather, the situation and the message will determine the appraisal".
Argyle (1970) put forward the idea that spoken language is mainly used for communicating information about external events, and non-verbal codes are used in interpersonal relationships. According to Argyle, there are five primary functions of nonverbal bodily behavior in human communication:

Paralanguage is the study of nonverbal cues of the voice. Various acoustic properties of speech such as tone, pitch and accent, collectively known as prosody, can all give off nonverbal cues. Paralanguage may change the meaning of words.

The linguist George L. Trager developed a classification system which consists of the voice set, voice qualities, and vocalization.

Clothes, and fashion generally, send messages. We judge others by what we see, at least when we first meet them. Fashion is a reflection of the time and place. The styles show as much about history and the time period as any history book. Clothes reflect on what people think, and how they live. Fashion is a nonverbal statement. It reflects our time, our beliefs and sometimes our religion.

Body language means how your body is held: the "stance". It tends to show your attitude (state of mind) to what is going on round you. Others pick up the signs in a flash. 

Eye contact can indicate interest, attention, and involvement. Gaze includes looking while talking, looking while listening, amount of gaze, and frequency of glances, patterns of fixation, pupil dilation, and blink rate.

Showing strong emotions is powerful communication which is immediately understood. Many of the signals are the same in all cultures, as Darwin showed. Examples of strong emotions shown visually are:
These are listed in order of clarity. No-one mistakes anger or fear, but more subtle emotions may sometimes be missed by the onlooker.

Touch is classic nonverbal communication. It is perhaps the most intimate (closest) thing one person can do to another. What it means depends on the context. Here is a short-list of what we may do when we touch another person:

Most of the arts are forms of non-verbal communication:

Skeptical Inquirer

The Skeptical Inquirer is an American science magazine. The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) publishes this magazine every other month. This magazine's subtitle is now "The magazine for science and reason". Articles in the magazine are about science and pseudoscience (fake or phony science).

"The mission of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry is to promote scientific inquiry, critical investigation, and the use of reason in examining controversial and extraordinary claims." The "Skeptical Inquirer" is not a formal scientific journal. 

The Skeptical Inquirer criticizes topics, such as homeopathy, astrology, SETI, the creationism-evolution controversy, global warming, AIDS denial, and whether legendary persons such as King Arthur were real. The magazine also includes general interest science articles.

In 2006, the "Skeptical Inquirer" was 30 years old. CSICOP (the original name of CSI) founder Paul Kurtz then listed four policies:

Several collections of articles from the "Skeptical Inquirer," have been published. Books of collections of articles are:

Pair production

In physics, pair production is what happens when a photon interacts with the nucleus of an atom, instead of the electron like in lower level x-ray interactions. The photon gives its energy to the nucleus and then creates a pair of positively and negatively charged electrons. The positive electron (positron) ionizes until it combines with a free electron. The two photons scatter in opposite directions.

The probability of pair production is proportional to the energy of the incoming photon and is affected by the material's atomic number. Pair production usually happens with energy levels over 25 MeV. Pair production happens sometimes in radiation therapy treatments with high-energy photon beams.

Acupuncture

Acupuncture is an ancient kind of medical treatment in which thin metal needles are pushed into different parts of the body. Acupuncture was developed by the Chinese about 5,000 years ago. It is still used today. It uses the Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. Chinese doctors have performed surgery with acupuncture as the only anesthetic. Recently, acupuncture has begun to be accepted in the West. Many states now accept schools of acupuncture. Some doctors are studying and using acupuncture. In the United States acupuncture has often been used to help control pain and drug and alcohol addiction. It is also often used to treat headaches, asthma, and arthritis. It is widely agreed that acupuncture treatment is safe when done by well-trained doctors using clean needles. It is also agreed, though, that more study is needed.

<doc id="250326" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=250326" title="Sexual selection">
Sexual selection

Sexual selection is a special kind of natural selection. It is a theory of Charles Darwin that certain traits can be explained by competition "within" a species. 

Darwin defined sexual selection as the effects of the "struggle between the individuals of one sex, generally the males, for the possession of the other sex". It is usually males who fight each other. Traits selected by male combat are called secondary sexual characteristics (including horns, antlers, etc.) and sometimes referred to as 'weapons'. Traits selected by mate choice are called 'ornaments'.

Females often prefer to mate with males with external ornaments—exaggerated features of morphology. Genes that enable males to develop impressive ornaments or fighting ability may simply show off greater disease resistance or a more efficient metabolism—features that also benefit females. This idea is known as the 'good genes' hypothesis. Sexual selection is still being researched and discussed today.

Ernst Mayr said:

Today, biologists would say that certain evolutionary traits can be explained by competition between members of the "same" species. Competition can be "before" or "after" sexual intercourse. 



Finally, sexual conflict is said to occur between breeding partners, sometimes leading to an evolutionary arms race between males and females. This is based on the simple fact that the interests of males and females in reproduction are fundamentally different. Males: their interest is to mate with a large number of completely faithful females, thus spreading their genes widely in the population.
Females: Their interest is to mate with a large number of fit males, thus producing a large number of fit and "varied" offspring.

Female mating preferences are widely recognized as being responsible for the rapid and divergent evolution of male secondary sexual traits. Females of many animal species prefer to mate with males with external ornaments – exaggerated features such as elaborate sex organs. Alternatively, genes that enable males to develop impressive ornaments or fighting ability may simply show off greater disease resistance or a more efficient metabolism. These features would be likely to be inherited by offspring.

Sabine Bergmann-Pohl (born 20 April 1946) is a German conservative politician who served as the last head of state of East Germany from 5 April to 2 October 1990. On 3 October, East and West Germany were reunited.

She was born in Eisenach and studied medicine. She joined the CDU in 1981 and, after East Germany's only free elections, held in March 1990, became a member of the Volkskammer. On 5 April 1990 she became the President of the Volkskammer and, as the Council of State of the German Democratic Republic had been abolished, head of state of East Germany - the only woman to hold the post.
She met with former United States President Ronald Reagan in East Berlin before reunification and said "Mr. President, we have much to thank you for." 

Upon reunification she was named a Minister Without Portfolio. She was Federal Minister for Special Affairs from 1990 to 1991, and Under-Secretary of State for Health between 1991 and 1998. She also became a member of the Bundestag.

She retired from the Bundestag in September 2002. She is a Protestant.

This template has various options in order to customise the template.

The location parameter is used to specify the location of the template.

The format parameter is used to specify the type of template used.

The size parameter is used to specify whether to include the frame and caption. Add "size=frameless" to display just the picture on its own if this is desired; otherwise leave out the parameter so the frame and caption will be included.

Note: the location parameter is used only in the medal, book and ribbon formats and the size parameter is used only in the medal and book formats. They will have no effect on the other formats and therefore these parameters should be left out (not blank) if other formats are selected.

The caption on the template can be customised using these parameters. The caption has two auto updating sections: one for the editor's title and one for the editor's award. The three caption parameters specify the text either side of these auto updating sections and the punctuation parameter specifies what punctuation character to use at the end of the caption.

Note: the caption and punctuation parameters will have no effect on the ribbon format and therefore these parameters should be left out (not blank) if this format is selected.

Blood atonement

Blood atonement was a doctrine of the Mormon Church. It was first preached by Brigham Young in the 1850s, though Joseph Smith may have thought of it first. At one time, most Mormons believed it, but now only some fundamentalists do. It was the belief that some things people do are so bad, they have to be atoned (taken care of with God) by being killed. This is sometimes called "blood-for-blood" punishment because it was used to punish murder. However, it was also sometimes used for non-violent crimes, such as denying or leaving the church and marrying someone of a different race. The blood atonement idea led to firing squads being allowed in Utah for many years. It also may have led to the Mountain Meadows Massacre, where Mormons killed some emigrants from Arkansas.

John Michael Wright

John Michael Wright (May 1617 – July 1694) was a British portrait painter in the Baroque style. 

Wright was taught in Edinburgh by the Scots painter George Jamesone. He became a famous artist and scholar during his long journey in Rome. There, he entered the Accademia di San Luca, and came to know some of the most important artists of his time. He was hired by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, the governor of the Spanish Netherlands in 1655. His job was to find artworks in Oliver Cromwell's England in 1655. 

He settled in England from 1656. He served there as a court painter before and after the English Restoration. A Roman Catholic, he was favoured by the Stuart court. Hired by both Charles II and James II, he saw many of the political experiences of the era. In the last years of the Stuart rule he went back to Rome as part of an embassy to Pope Innocent XI.

Today, Wright is seen as one of the most important British painters of his time. He is important mostly because of the special realism he used in his portraits. Perhaps because of his unusual experiences, he was favoured by people of the highest level of society. This was surprising in an age in which foreign artists were usually more liked. Wright's paintings of royalty and aristocracy are in the collections of many great galleries today.

John Michael Wright, who would later sign himself ""Anglus"" or ""Scotus"", is of uncertain origin. The diarist John Evelyn called him a Scotsman. Horace Walpole and his later biographer, Verne, agreed with this. 

But in 1700, Thomas Hearne claimed that Wright was born in Shoe Lane, London. He added that after Wright became a Roman Catholic when he was an adolescent, he was taken to Scotland by a priest. A baptismal record, dated 25 May 1617, for a "Mighell Wryghtt", son of James Wright, described as a tailor and a citizen of London, in London, seems to agree with this claim.

Xenophanes

Xenophanes of Colophon, c.570 – c.475 , was a Greek philosopher, poet, and social and religious critic.

Our knowledge of his views comes from fragments of his poetry, surviving as quotations by later Greek writers. To judge from these, his poetry criticized and satirized a wide range of ideas. This included Homer and Hesiod, the belief in the pantheon of anthropomorphic gods and the Greeks' veneration of . He is the earliest Greek poet who claims explicitly to be writing for future generations, creating "fame that will reach all of Greece, and never die while the Greek kind of songs survives".

Xenophanes' surviving writings display a skepticism that became more commonly expressed during the 4th century BC. He satirized the polytheistic beliefs of earlier Greek poets and of his own contemporaries. "Homer and Hesiod" one fragment states, "have attributed to the gods all sorts of things that are matters of reproach and censure among men: theft, adultery, and mutual deception". Sextus Empiricus reported that such ideas were savored by Christian apologists. Xenophanes is quoted, memorably, in Clement of Alexandria, arguing against the conception of gods as fundamentally anthropomorphic:
But if cattle and horses and lions had hands<br>or could paint with their hands and create works such as men do,<br>horses like horses and cattle like cattle<br>also would depict the gods' shapes and make their bodies<br>of such a sort as the form they themselves have.<br>...<br>Ethiopians say that their gods are snubnosed and black<br>Thracians that they are pale and red-haired.

<doc id="250506" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=250506" title="On the Origin of Species">
On the Origin of Species

On the Origin of Species is the famous book by Charles Darwin. It gave evidence for evolution, and suggested what had caused evolution to happen. 

Its full title was "On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life". 

It was published by John Murray in London in 1859. It was translated into many languages, and has been in print ever since. The title since the 6th edition of 1872 has been "The Origin of Species". This is the most important single book in the biological sciences, and its main ideas are well-supported by modern research.

Darwin's book did two things. First, it provided a great deal of evidence that evolution has taken place. Second, it proposed a theory to explain "how" evolution works. That theory is natural selection. Evolution by natural selection is the key to understanding biology, and the diversity of life on Earth.

Darwin's ideas on the connection between natural selection and inheritance were unclear, mainly because the process of genetic inheritance was unknown at that time. This was solved in the mid-20th century by the modern evolutionary synthesis, which showed that Gregor Mendel's genetics was compatible with evolution in small steps. Darwin made almost no mention of the evolution of the human race, though most of the controversy raged around this topic. Darwin eventually published "The Descent of Man" in 1871.

The "Origin" was a serious blow to all who interpreted the Bible literally. However, even in 1860, there were many Christians who thought some of the Old Testament could not be literally true. Even the early Church Fathers had not interpreted Genesis literally. Today, both the Anglican and Catholic churches hold that evolution is not inconsistent with their beliefs.

The "Origin" marked a big step in the history of science. Before it, religious leaders often gave their opinions on science; after – though it took time – science increasingly became the business of professional scientists. Darwin's friend Thomas Henry Huxley devoted many years to supporting Darwin, and opposing any interference of religion in science.

All aspects of biology have been affected by evolution. Before Darwin, most biology was natural history, done by dedicated amateurs. After Darwin, most biology was done by professionals trained in modern techniques. The book helped this change by providing evolution as the explanation of how living things came to be as they are. 

Darwin's aims were twofold: to show that species had not been separately created, and to show that natural selection had been the chief agent of change. 

Many readers were already familiar with the idea of evolution from a book published anonymously in 1844, "Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation" (actually by Robert Chambers). In his introduction Darwin ridicules that work as failing to provide a mechanism (a way it could happen). 

The first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by the struggle for existence, is analogous to the selection of variations under domestication.

Darwin presents supporting facts drawn from many disciplines. The idea was to show that his theory could explain a myriad of observations from many fields of natural history that were inexplicable if species had been individually created.


There were six editions of the "Origin" during Darwin's life. The second, in 1860, was almost the same as the first. The sixth edition bore the title: "The origin of species".

There were many changes in the text in later editions. In the fifth edition of 1869 Darwin used Herbert Spencer's phrase 'survival of the fittest' for the first time, in the heading of chapter 4. 

In the sixth and last edition, Darwin uses the word 'evolution' for the first time in this book. There is a new chapter 7 inserted:

The "Origin" was translated during Darwin's lifetime into Danish, Dutch, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Serbian, Spanish and Swedish, and into 18 more languages since. Translations into some languages, such as French and German, were done more than once.

There are some reference works which help scholars to do research on the "Origin".

Peckham, Morse (ed) 1959. "The Origin of Species: a variorum text". University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. A variorum contains all variants of a text; this records every change made by Darwin to the first edition up to 1890. 

Horblit H.D. 1964. "One hundred books famous in science". Grolier Club. Contains the first full bibliographic description of the first edition.

Hello all, we should really thinking about out most wanted list, before my replacements:
Should we not replace these by better candidates? - We do have very limited resources. I think most authors are probably not interested in creating/reading about such articles. I assume the most wanted list is bot-created. We should therefore cut down on the references, and get the list re-created. Thoughts?-- () 13:18, 30 May 2010 (UTC)
Just another idea: We currently have 10 "most wanted" entries, and currently 6 top-level "knowledge groups"
This would prevent a situation like now, where one "subject area" is dominating. The more "variety" we have, the more likely we'll see the articles getting created. -- () 16:40, 30 May 2010 (UTC)

Where we have options is how articles are picked.
I think it's important for us to pick articles from various topics (and using our Knowledge Groups is one way of doing that). To actually pick the articles, I think this last option is probably the best, since it represents the articles that are actually most likely to be read, rather than the ones currently most linked to on our wiki. Thoughts? 16:44, 30 May 2010 (UTC)

Personally I think we should focus less on this sort of thing...the old way was a simple way that didn't require administration for the most part which is why it was ok to do it. But once we start pulling people away from actual editing to decide on these sorts of things, they become less valuable. I'd rather see the most wanted list disappear completely than to be made even more complex and time consumming. - () 18:37, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

But I think we currently do not have this problem.-- () 13:19, 13 June 2010 (UTC)

Ok. Results are in. The title of the window is called "Change conflict: PAGETITLE". The text is:

The first box shows the article now (after the other person's edits). You should not ignore the new changes, but should add your edits into the first box. 

Only the text in the first edit box will be saved when you press "Save page". 
So, the text in the edit conflict page use both terms. Now, as a community, do we want to keep both in play, or do we prefer one over the other? - @ 04:24, 12 June 2010 (UTC)

I recently came across . While it is a good faith attempt at enforcing wikibreaks, we shouldn't be entertaining those types of block requests (unless compromised account or some other situation that hasn't been thought of). Wikipedia is not therapy (as the page points out), and if you can't stay away, then maybe the block reason shouldn't be "user request" but something else. Community consensus supported not blocking BG7 because of a user request over a year ago, but I'd like to add this officially to policy. Since threads often have a habit of dying off, after a week, I'll have an uninvolved 'crat look at this and make a decision. Note: I'm sure there will be a few more exceptions to the rule, but I expect admins to use common sense when applying this. () 22:16, 16 June 2010 (UTC)

If it works well on enwp, are we going to adopt it? I don't think we have much use for Level 2 flagged protection, but I think for this wiki Level 1 would serve excellently as an alternative to semi-protection altogether. Because it is so flexible in allowing IP edits, but not letting vandalism show up straight away, it would encourage more editing of this wiki. Also, reviewing it would just be an easy extension of RC patrol, which many of us do anyway. Any malicious IP vandalises Justin Bieber or something, just nuke with no change to the reader. What do you think? Is it too much extra work? {{||}} 10:37, 13 June 2010 (UTC)
Looking through our protection log, I do not see a lot of protection actions that are done. To add reviewing into this would just add an unnecessary level of bureaucracy. Just use the protection tool, and if an IP wants to edit while it's protected, they can post a request on the talk page of the article. () 15:29, 13 June 2010 (UTC)

Reviewing the opinions above, and reviewing the feature, I don't think this is needed for our wiki. Best, @:~$ 17:58, 13 June 2010 (UTC)
A lot of vandalism is missed by the CVN team. From what I understand, this gives IPs more freedom, with little cost to us, since it is only used on specific pages. If the reviewers are sysops-only, all the better, as we can then guarantee the quality of the revisions. Not sure why we shouldn't adopt it. () 20:58, 13 June 2010 (UTC)

I strongly support the implementation of FlaggedRevs/Pending Changes. This system is very useful and clearly will help improving our articles, and will reduce the vandalism considerably. I say yes. -- 02:47, 14 June 2010 (UTC)

I don't really see the point, since pretty much every single edit here gets looked at since our RC moves so slow. - () 23:51, 17 June 2010 (UTC)

Lately, in my copyedits, I have been removing links to dates. For example, this revision. However, I'm been seeing that has been undoing some of my removals. I just want to confirm that I am doing this correctly. () 21:47, 18 June 2010 (UTC)

The supports were most kind, and I felt each with gratitude: most of the opposes were almost equally kind, and just as reasonable and interesting: I sincerely thank all. I especially want to thank dear , who had the trust in me to nominate me, and , who adopted me and taught me so very much! I firmly promise not to abuse the trust given to me and to do my best to prove that I am not ungrateful for it. With warm gratitude, —"" 13:21, 20 June 2010 (UTC)

I've just started working on Macbeth, and I have a question. Can I cite it to itself? Most of the plot doesn't have any other sources. How would I cite it if I did so? Would each sentence have to have inline citations to a specific line in the play, or is it less rigid? {{||}} 09:37, 21 June 2010 (UTC)

I have noticed that many articles in Simple English Wikipedia is too short. I think it is because many people are afraid of writing too complex stuff.

What exactly is the purpose of this page? At the top, it claims that the page is to "ask any questions you have about the Simple English Wikipedia". However, lately I've been seeing other uses of this page, including , , that is more suited to be brought up at , and just to name a few. If these uses are acceptable, I ask that they be integrated into the box at the top. If not, such misuse should cease. Thanks, () 22:04, 21 June 2010 (UTC)
This page is basically the "General Forum" of the wiki. Anything wiki related goes on here. AN board is for specific incidents such as what to do with a specific user who is missbehaving. As has been mentioned the top box is for new users. The box at the top is just a pointer to new editors that this is the best place to ask a question. - () 23:22, 21 June 2010 (UTC)

Should we change the logo (at the top-left corner of the screen) to look like the one on the English Wikipedia? There are significant differences between the two: vs. Ve :| 06:12, 19 June 2010 (UTC)
Note, the font(s) has to easily available and common in operating systems. Fonts that are limited in availability/not pre-installed on the operating system will just render as the default font in the browser. Note there's not only Windows used by editors on this project; there's Linux and Macs as well. Personally I prefer the fonts we already have. 13:16, 24 June 2010 (UTC)

Please see . I'm wondering if it makes sense to formalize a policy about this??? 19:35, 21 June 2010 (UTC)

Is there any difference between the references used in the English Wikipedia and this Simple English Wikipedia? If not, is it possible to copy the references from there to here, and simply reword the English Wikipedia? Ve :| 03:50, 22 June 2010 (UTC)

Help! I don't know why the system isn't working. So far I've copied this and this over to my versions. I've even copied the template and documentation subpage for over to the simple Wiki, but even that isn't helping. Can anybody help? Ve :| 21:54, 22 June 2010 (UTC)

I'm not sure that I'm doing this correctly, but I've opened up an informal poll on the talk page. Ve :| 18:10, 22 June 2010 (UTC)

Canaanite

Canaanites were a people mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, or Old Testament. Most of their land, called Canaan, later became known as Israel. 

The Canaanites settled in the region about 2000 BCE. They were the main inhabitants until about 1200 B.C. The Bible says that the Israelites conquered Canaan at that time. However, archaeology and some parts of the Bible suggest that the Israelites only gradually became the area's main people. Archaeology also suggests that many Canaanite cities were destroyed by the Sea Peoples, or Philistines, in the 1100s BCE. The Sea Peoples may have sailed to Canaan from the area around the Aegean Sea. 

The Canaanites were a Semitic people related to the Phoenicians, Amorites, Assyrians and Israelites. The Canaanites had a developed civilization. Their main political group was the city-state. In a city-stae, a king ruled a city or town and the villages and land around it. The Bible mentions a number of Canaanite tribes.

The chief Canaanite gods were El (a creator god) and Baal (a storm god). The main goddesses were Anat, Asherah, and Astarte. They were fertility goddesses.
