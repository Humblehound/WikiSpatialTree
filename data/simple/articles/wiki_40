Triple DES

In cryptography, Triple DES is a block cipher derived from the Data Encryption Standard (DES) cipher by using it three times. Triple DES is also known as TDES or, more standard, TDEA (Triple Data Encryption Algorithm ). 

When it was discovered that a 56-bit key of DES is not enough to protect from brute force attacks, TDES was chosen as a simple way to enlarge the key space without a need to switch to a new algorithm. The use of three steps is essential to prevent meet-in-the-middle attacks that are effective against double DES encryption.

In general TDES with three different keys (3-key {k, k, k} TDES) has a key length of 168 bits: three 56-bit DES keys (with parity bits 3-key TDES has the total storage length of 192 bits), but due to the meet-in-the-middle attack the effective security it provides is only 112 bits. A variant, called two-key TDES (2-key TDES), uses k = k, thus reducing the key size to 112 bits and the storage length to 128 bits. However, this mode is susceptible to certain chosen-plaintext or known-plaintext attacks and thus it is designated by NIST to have only 80 bits of security .

By design, DES and therefore TDES, suffer from slow performance in software. TDES is better suited to hardware implementations, and indeed where it is still used is likely to be within a hardware implementation.

TDES is slowly disappearing from use, largely replaced by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). One large-scale exception is within the electronic payments industry, which still uses 2TDES extensively and continues to develop and spread standards based upon it (e.g. EMV, the standard for inter-operation of IC cards; also called ""Chip cards"", and IC capable POS terminals and ATM's). This guarantees that TDES will remain an active cryptographic standard well into the future.

Breakout (album)

Breakout is the second studio album by singer Miley Cyrus. The album was released July 22nd 2008. Singles from the album include "Full Circle", "Fly On The Wall", "7 Things", "Wake Up America", and "Breakout'. 

Cyrus performed a free concert at Bryant Park on July 18, as a part of "Good Morning America"'s summer concert series. Cyrus also guest hosted "TRL" on two consecutive days, appeared on "Today", and performed as a part of their summer concert series, shutting down 84th street for the first time because of the number of fans who attended.

"See You Again (Rock Mafia Remix)" is the second single from the album, it was released on August 11, 2008, only in the United Kingdom as a promotional single. This song peaked at #11 in the UK Singles Chart, making her first Top 20 in that region.

Advanced Encryption Standard

In cryptography, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is also known as Rijndael, is a block cipher algorithm used as an encryption standard by the U.S. government. It has been looked at a lot and is now used all over the world, as was the case with its predecessor, the Data Encryption Standard (DES). AES was announced by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as U.S. FIPS PUB 197 (FIPS 197) on November 26, 2001 after a 5-year standardization process in which fifteen competing designs were presented and evaluated before Rijndael was selected as the most suitable. It became effective as a standard May 26, 2002. As of 2008, AES is one of the most popular algorithms used in symmetric key cryptography. It is available by choice in many different encryption packages. This marks the first time that the public has had access to a cipher algorithm approved by NSA for top secret information.

This cipher algorithm was developed by two Belgian cryptographers, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, and submitted to the AES selection process under the name "Rijndael", a portmanteau of the names of the inventors. (Rijndael is ).

Strictly speaking, AES is not precisely Rijndael (although in practice they are used interchangeably), following are the main differences:

"The design and strength of all key lengths of the AES algorithm (i.e., 128, 192 and 256) are sufficient to protect classified information up to the SECRET level. TOP SECRET information will require use of either the 192 or 256 key lengths. The implementation of AES in products intended to protect national security systems and/or information must be reviewed and certified by NSA prior to their acquisition and use."

Many AES public products use 128-bit secret keys by default; it is possible that the NSA may assume that 128-bit secret keys are weak and they may prefer longer keys for top secret documents. 

Unlike DES (the predecessor of AES), AES is a substitution-permutation network, not a Feistel network. AES is fast in both software and hardware, is relatively easy to implement, and requires little memory. As a new encryption standard, it is currently being deployed on a large scale on various platforms.

Shōnen (media)

Shōnen is a type of media meant for boys usually between the ages of about 10 and 17. It often refers to manga. Examples include "Dragon Ball", "Bleach", "One Piece", "InuYasha", "Naruto", "YuYu Hakusho", and "Yu-Gi-Oh!".

Shounen is usually noticed by its high amounts of fighting. It often has humorous plots with male characters. It often has themes of friendship. Fighting teams and similar groups are often shown. Attractive female characters are also common, but not always present. The art style of shounen is usually less pretty than shōjo.

Beyond shōnen manga, manga for men (age 18+) is called seinen manga. Very few seinen manga have been published outside of Japan. In Japan, many older men read shounen magazines. Because of this, in Japan, shounen manga magazines are the most popular manga magazines.

Smile In Your Sleep

Smile In Your Sleep is a 2006 single released by emo band Silverstein. It's from their second album, "Discovering the Waterfront"

The music video for smile in your sleep is loosely based on the board game clue. Some shots show the band members with various weapons used in the game, and each of them has their own character. At the end of the video, they all walk off 1 by 1 and an old looking guy comes and covers the camera.

There is one shot of the victim being dragged on the black and white corridor.

The Amazing Race

The Amazing Race is a reality television/game show. It is broadcast on CBS. 
In The Amazing Race, 11 or 12 teams of two people race around the world for $1,000,000, with information provided by "clues", or Route Info. There are certain "legs" of the race, culminated by "Pit Stops". At Pit Stops, teams check in for a mandatory 12 hour rest period, although sometimes the period can be 24 hours, 36 hours, or even once 60. Usually, the first team to arrive at a Pit Stop will receive a prize, such as a trip to a Caribbean country. On most of the Pit Stops on the race, the last team to arrive is eliminated from the race. However, two or three of those points are non-elimination. In Seasons 1-4, there was no penalty for coming in last in a non-elimination. From Seasons 5-9, teams had to give up all of their money and start the next leg without money. Even stricter, in Seasons 7-9, teams had to turn over all of their luggage. In Seasons 10 and 11, teams would start the next leg "Marked for Elimination". That meant that if they did not come in first at the next Pit Stop, they would have to wait out a 30-minute penalty. Starting from Season 12, teams coming in last on Non-Eliminations have to do a Speed Bump. A Speed Bump is a task that no other teams have to do.

The Amazing Race has several different tasks that teams must complete. 

A Detour is a choice between two tasks. The team can choose which one it wants to complete. Teams are allowed to switch between Detour choices, but there is a harsh 24-hour penalty if you quit a Detour. 
A Roadbock is a task for only one member of team can do it. Teams do not to switch a member as do the task, but there is a harsh 4-hour penalty if you quit a Roadbock.
A Fastforward is a task for skip all the task in that leg to the pit stop.
The Amazing Race was created by Bertram van Munster and Elise Doganieri in 2001. It has been airing from 2001 to present.
The Amazing Race is seen as hard to produce. Producers need to find places, come up with tasks and pick teams. Cameramen have to keep up with the teams, and people are not allowed to give away the results. However, The Amazing Race has won 6 Emmy awards.

Besides the original American version, The Amazing Race has generated several versions from around the world.

Global financial crisis of September–October 2008

The global financial crisis of September–October 2008 is a major ongoing financial crisis, the worst of its kind since the Great Depression. It became prominently visible in September, 2008 with the failure, merger or conservatorship of several large United States-based financial firms. The underlying causes leading to the crisis had been reported in business journals for many months before September, with commentary about the financial stability of leading U.S. and European investment banks, insurance firms and mortgage banks consequent to the subprime mortgage crisis.

A detritivore (also known as decomposers) is an animal that feeds on dead organisms (living things) and breaks them down into smaller molecules. Detritivores are essential in the ecosystem as they return important materials such as carbon (see carbon cycle) back into the environment. Examples of common detritivores include earthworms and woodlice, but also includes microscopic (things that can only be seen using a microscope) bacteria.

<doc id="136443" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=136443" title="Carbon cycle">
Carbon cycle

The carbon cycle is the way carbon is stored and replaced on Earth. Some of the main events take hundreds of millions of years, others happen annually.

The main ways that carbon gets into the carbon cycle are volcanoes, and the burning of fossil fuels like coal and gas. Through most of history, volcanoes were the biggest source of carbon to the carbon cycle, but in the last hundred years, people burning fossil fuels have added much more CO to the air than volcanoes have, by about a hundred times. That is, for every ton of CO added to the air by volcanoes, about 100 tons of CO have been added to the air by people.

The main way carbon gets taken out of the atmosphere is by photosynthesis by living organisms. Some of this gets released as they die and decompose, but a proportion gets buried in sediment. This is shown in the diagram. Sediment turns to rock, and it is the carbonate rocks like limestone which contain the now-solid CO. Some of the carbon from plants also becomes part of the soil, where it can stay for a long time before decomposing.

Another process takes CO out of the air. Weathering by rain washes out CO in the form of dilute carbonic acid. This reacts with rock, helping to dissolve and destroy it. This also ends up as sediment.

Some CO is also dissolved in the ocean. Right now, the oceans are taking in more CO than they are releasing, every year. However, this is making the oceans more acidic.

The store of carbon in sedimentary rock is far greater than the CO in the atmosphere (this is not shown in the diagram). Eventually it returns to the air as oceanic plates subduct in plate tectonics. At the margins of plate boundaries (and some other places) volcanoes form and spew out CO. This completes the cycle.

The Carbon Cycle is a process where carbon is recycled through the ecosystem. The concentration of carbon in living matter (18%) is almost 100 times greater than its concentration in the earth (0.19%). So living things extract carbon from their nonliving environment. For life to continue, this carbon must be recycled. See the diagram for a detailed look at the carbon cycle. An example of a route carbon takes in this cycle is carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by plants and used in photosynthesis to produce sugars which the plant uses for energy. When the plant dies, it decomposes and the carbon stored in the plant will, over millions of years, form into coal (a fossil fuel). The coal is burnt and gives off carbon dioxide which goes into the atmosphere. Also the carbon cycle has to relate to quantum mechanics due to the restoration of water 

At the moment, the carbon cycle, and how human activity is affecting it, is a big topic in international news. Fossil fuels are a non-renewable resource which means that once we've burned them all, there is not any more, and our use of fossil fuels has nearly doubled every 20 years since 1900. Also, the burning of fossil fuels produces pollution which contributes to the greenhouse effect and acid rain.

The carbon cycle was initially discovered by Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier, and popularized by Humphry Davy.

Skepticism or scepticism (Greek "skeptomai": to consider, to examine) refers to any view involving "doubt".


Skepticism has its roots in ancient Greek philosophy. The Greek Sophists of the 5th century BC, such as Protagoras of Abdera (480–411 BC), were for the most part skeptics. Gorgias (485–380 BC) said that "Nothing exists; if anything does exist, it cannot be known; if anything exists and can be known, it cannot be communicated". In the 4th century BC Pyrrho of Elis (c360–275 BC), who travelled and studied as far as India, adopted practical skepticism. Carneades (c213–129 BC) denied absolute truth and falsity. He criticized the Dogmatists, especially supporters of Stoicism, asserting that absolute certainty of knowledge is impossible. Sextus Empiricus (c200 AD), the main authority for Greek skepticism, incorporated empiricism into the basis for asserting knowledge.

The nub of the argument is the proposition that unless we know "something" for certain, then we cannot know anything at all. The interest lies in the way great philosophers have sought to counter this problem. Some, like Descartes, retreat into the mind: "I think, therefore I am". Others, such as the British empiricists John Locke and David Hume, would rely on our sense perception. Certain kinds of knowledge may be especially vulnerable to skepticism. For example, an agnostic believes that knowledge of supernatural things cannot be attained. 

Skepticism is widely used as a method for research in science, and (with variations) in modern legal procedure. Here doubt, suspending judgement, methodical investigation, testing and discussion precede any statement of facts. Sometimes the process takes years before consensus is reached. This systematic approach is called "methodological skepticism". It is probably the most important legacy of the skeptics.

United States Secretary of War

The Secretary of War was a member of the United States President's Cabinet, beginning with George Washington's administration. A similar position, called either "Secretary at War" or "Secretary of War," was appointed to serve the Congress of the Confederation under the Articles of Confederation between 1781 and 1789. Benjamin Lincoln and later Henry Knox held the position. When Washington was inaugurated as the first president under the Constitution, he appointed Knox to continue serving. 

The Secretary of War led the War Department. At first, he was responsible for all military affairs. In 1798, the Secretary of the Navy was added to the cabinet, and the scope of this office was reduced to a general concern with the Army. In 1947, the departments were recombined under the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of War was replaced by the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Air Force, non-Cabinet positions under the Secretary of Defense.

United States Postmaster General

The United States Postmaster General is the executive head of the United States Postal Service. The office, in one form or another, is older than both the United States Constitution and the United States Declaration of Independence. Benjamin Franklin was appointed by the Continental Congress as the first Postmaster General, serving slightly longer than 15 months.

In 1971, the Post Office Department was re-organized into the United States Postal Service, a special agency independent of the executive branch. Thus, the Postmaster General is no longer a member of the Cabinet and is no longer in line to be President.

It is located south of Ibiza (about 10 kilometres), south-west of Mallorca (about 50 kilometres).
It's area is 83.24 km² (32.14 sq mi).
Formentera has about 7,500 inhabitants. 
The island was built by vulcano erruptions.
It has two high areas in the east and the south and a falt area in between.
Main town is Sant Francesc Xavier.

First people, who settled on Formentera, were the Carthaginians, later the Romans came there. Often the island lost its complete population, for example after the Vandals came there.
In the middle age Arabs governed the balearic island, then Catalans took over the island, Formentera became part of the new kingdom of Mallorca.
Later that kingdom became a part of Spain.

The island lives mainly on tourism. Most tourist are from Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy and France.

Minorca was influenced by the Minons.
Later it was ruled by the Carthageans, after the Punic Wars by the Romans.
From the 5th century AD there was a seat of a bishop on Minorca. Then the Vandals invaded it. After they left, the Moors took over.
Later Minorca was ruled by the Kingdom of Mallorca and then it became a part of Spain.
For a few decades Minorca was ruled by the British, but the Spanish recovered it again.

RC4

In cryptography, RC4 (also known as ARC4 or ARCFOUR meaning Alleged RC4, see below) is one of the most common software stream ciphers. It is used in popular protocols like Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) (to protect Internet traffic) and WEP (to secure wireless networks). 

RC4 is known for being simple and quick, but attacks are likely to happen when the start of the output keystream is not removed, or one keystream is used twice; some ways of using RC4 can turn into very insecure cryptosystems such as WEP.

RC4 was created by Ron Rivest of RSA Security in 1987. While its official name is "Rivest Cipher 4", the RC acronym is also known to stand for "Ron's Code" (see also RC2, RC5 and RC6).

RC4 was first created as a trade secret, but in September 1994 a description of it was posted to the Cypherpunks mailing list. It was soon posted on the sci.crypt newsgroup, and from there to many websites on the Internet. The code was confirmed to be genuine(not fake) as its output matched that of proprietary software using licensed RC4. Because the algorithm is known, it is no longer a trade secret. The name "RC4" is trademarked, however. RC4 is often referred to as "ARCFOUR" or "ARC4" (meaning Alleged RC4, because RSA has never officially released the algorithm), to avoid possible trademark problems. It has become part of some commonly used encryption protocols and standards, including WEP and WPA for wireless cards and TLS.

The two main reasons which helped its use over such a big range of applications are its speed and simplicity. Uses of RC4 in both software and hardware are extremely easy to develop.

The RC4 encryption algorithm is started with a different key length, usually between 40 and 256 bits, using the "key-scheduling" algorithm (KSA). Once this has been completed, the stream of encrypted bits is created using the "pseudo-random generation algorithm" (PRGA).

RC4 fails the standards set by cryptographers for a secure cipher in many ways, and is not recommended for use in new applications as there are a lot of methods of attacking RC4.


Where a cryptosystem is marked with "(optionally)", RC4 is one of several ciphers the system can be set to use.

Blowfish (cipher)

In cryptography, Blowfish is a keyed, symmetric block cipher, made in 1993 by Bruce Schneier and since 1993 has been included(put together) in a large number of encryption products. Blowfish has a good encryption rate in software and until 2008 no cryptanalytic attack model of it has been found. However, the AES block cipher algorithm now has more attention.

Schneier made Blowfish as a general-purpose algorithm, to be used as a replacement for the old DES algorithm and to remove the problems and difficulties of other encryption algorithms. At the time Blowfish was released, many other algorithms were proprietary, or were secrets. Schneier has said that, "Blowfish is unpatented, and will remain so in all countries. The algorithm is hereby placed in the public domain, and can be freely used by anyone."

Main features of the design include key-dependent S-boxes and a very complex key schedule. Blowfish is one of the fastest block ciphers used by many people, except when changing keys. Each new key needs to be pre-processed which takes the same time as encrypting about 4 kilobytes of text, which is very slow compared to other block ciphers. This stops its use in certain applications (such as in the smallest embedded systems like the early smartcards), but it is not a problem in other applications. In one of the applications, it is actually good: the password-hashing method used in OpenBSD uses an algorithm that comes from Blowfish which makes use of the slow key schedule; the idea is that the extra computational effort required gives protection against dictionary attacks. "See" key strengthening.

Blowfish has a 64-bit block size and a variable key length from 0 up to 448 bits
It is a 16-round Feistel cipher and uses large key-dependent S-boxes. It is similar in structure to CAST-128, which uses fixed S-boxes.

In 1996, Serge Vaudenay found a known-plaintext attack needing 2 known plaintexts to break, where "r" is the number of rounds. Moreover, he also found a class of weak keys that can be detected and broken by the same attack with only 2 known plaintexts. This attack cannot be used against the regular Blowfish; it assumes knowledge of the key-dependent S-boxes. Vincent Rijmen, in his Ph.D. papers, introduced a second-order differential attack that can break four rounds and no more. Still there is no known way to break the full 16 rounds, apart from a brute-force search. 
A sign extension bug in one of the published C code has been found in 1996.

There is no good cryptanalysis on the full-round version of Blowfish known publicly till 2008. However in 2007, Bruce Schneier noted that while Blowfish is still in use, he recommended using the new Twofish algorithm instead

Line of Actual Control

The Line of Actual Control (LAC) is the effective border between India and China. The LAC is 4,057-km long and traverses three areas of northern Indian states: western (Ladakh, Kashmir), middle (Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh) and eastern (Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh). Quote: "India is used to incursions by Chinese troops across the 4,057-km LAC in all the three sectors—western (Ladakh), middle (Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh) and eastern (Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh)— in a bid to strengthen China's claim over disputed areas and ensure New Delhi does not change its Tibet policy." 

Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai used the phrase in a letter addressed to Indian Prime Minister Nehru dated October 24, 1959. In a letter dated November 7, Zhou told Nehru that the LAC consisted of "the so-called McMahon Line in the east and the line up to which each side exercises actual control in the west". During the Sino-Indian War (1962), Nehru claimed not to know where the line was: "There is no sense or meaning in the Chinese offer to withdraw twenty kilometers from what they call 'line of actual control'. What is this 'line of control'? Is this the line they have created by aggression since the beginning of September? Advancing forty or sixty kilometers by blatant military aggression and offering to withdraw twenty kilometers provided both sides do this is a deceptive device which can fool nobody."

Indian Kashmir barrier

The Indian Kashmir barrier is a 550 km (330 mile) separation barrier along the 740 km (460 mi) disputed 1972 Line of Control (or ceasefire line) between Indian and Pakistani controlled Kashmir: Jammu and Kashmir, India and Pakistan Controlled Kashmir (PCK). The rest of the Line of Control is too inaccessible for construction of a barrier. The fence, constructed by India, is well inside territory on the Indian-controlled side. Its stated purpose is to exclude arms smuggling and infiltration by Pakistani-based separatist militants, who wish to merge Kashmir into Pakistan, or gain independence for Kashmir as a whole.

The barrier itself consists of double-row of fencing and concertina wire eight to twelve feet (2.4-3.7 m) in height, and is electrified and connected to a network of motion sensors, thermal imaging devices and alarms in stretches where power supply is available. The small stretch of land between the rows of fencing is mined.

The construction of the barrier was begun in the 1990s, but slowed in the early 2000s as hostilities between India and Pakistan increased. After a November 2003 ceasefire agreement, building resumed and was completed in late 2004. According to Indian military sources, the fence has reduced by 80% the numbers of militants who routinely cross into the Indian side of the disputed state to attack soldiers.

Pakistan has objected to the construction of the barrier, saying it violates both bilateral accords and relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions on the region. In Pakistan's view the border between Jammu and Kashmir is undemarcated, and border fencing is not allowed.

Hello,

I just want to clarify some of our GA/VGA system. Those that edit here for like 2 months will probably know what I write. Originally, we had the idea to make a class of "better articles", much like Featured Articles on EnWP. We called them Very good articles, the criteria were these. With the time we found ourselveswith more and more articles that successfully passed the criteria, but that we weren't happy with. There was a long discussion, , and we finally settled for the criteria for very good articles. Good articles also resulted form that discussion, they are mostly our old VGA criteria. Changes to the criteria include: GAs are shorter, and they can contain red links, although not too many. At the moment, I think there are 20 VGAs and 19 GAs. Other introductions were the minimal number of votes (in addition to a support percentage). Our GA criteria are perhaps too strict, seeing that there are almost as many GAs than VGAs.

Something we should probably discuss is how to make sure to get some kind of readability check in there - Jimi Hendrix seems to have been promoted despite some readability issues.

Ideas?-- () 19:52, 12 October 2008 (UTC)

 Comment on the criteria. At present it states (presumably in line with enwp "DYK is not a general trivia section. DYK is only for articles that have been created, or expanded fivefold or more, within the last 5 days." I disagree with this. There is too little activity here. I think any article should be eligible as long it is not a VGA (they have their own publicity space) and the fact(s) is (are) verified with a reference. -- () 00:33, 17 October 2008 (UTC)

Sauerbraten (video game)

Sauerbraten (also known as "Cube 2" or "Sauer", German for "“sour roast”") is a cross-platform, "Quake"-like, first-person shooter computer game that runs on Microsoft Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X using OpenGL and SDL. The game features single-player and multiplayer game play and contains an in-game level editor, its main feature. The game engine is free and open source software, under the Zlib License, with commercial support available from the developer's own business counterpart, Dot3 Labs.

The game started as a redesign to the original Cube Engine, and its first release was made on May 6, 2004. The most recent sauerbraten game, called "Sauerbraten CTF Edition", was given on June 17, 2008.

Sauerbraten was made out of the game Cube, but is much more advanced and a player can create new levels. Sauerbraten was not made to look very good, but to allow easy map making within the game without making a big download. Sauerbraten CTF edition is less than 350 megabytes. The game Crysis is around 3,000 megabytes.

Maps are made of cubes and can be made longer or shorter and can be made round. This is called "what you see is what you get" editing. People can add a lot of detail to maps very quickly. Cube 2's doesn't need expensive graphics cards but can produce high quality graphics.

Cube 2 is programmed on high quality computers but can also be run on very low quality computers.

The game has singleplayer and multiplayer modes. Multiplayer can be with LAN and Internet connection. Online game types are deathmatch, last man standing,"Capture" (where teams fight for control of parts on the map), Quake-style Capture the Flag, also instant-shot games (Instagib, Insta-clan-arena, insta-capture) as well as online multiplayer map editing, which is one of Sauerbraten's most interesting and popular features.

Town crier

A town crier is a person who is employed by a town council to make public announcements in the streets. The crier can also be used in court or official announcements. Criers often dress elaborately, a tradition known from the 18th century, in a red and gold robe, white breeches, black boots and a tricorne hat. 

They carry a handbell to make a loud noise and they shout the words "Oyez, Oyez, Oyez!" before making their announcements. The word "Oyez" means "hear ye," which is a call for silence and attention. "Oyez" is from an Anglo-Norman word for "listen". Some town criers announcements are recorded in books called a Proclamation Book The proclamations book in Chester from the early 19th century records the town criers call as "O Yes, O Yes!"

In Medieval England, town criers were the most important way of spreading news with the people of a town. Many could not read newspapers. Royal proclamations, local bylaws, market days, advertisments and even selling loaves of sugar were all proclaimed by a bellman or town crier for centuries. During Christmas 1798, the Chester Canal Company sold some sugar that was damaged in their packet boat and this was advertised by the town crier.

Chester's first 'belman' was in 1540. His was paid one (old) penny for 'going for anything that is lost' and 4 old pennies for leading a funeral procession. In 1681, a fire safety law that all houses should have tiled rooves, not thatched, was to 'be published throughout the city by the day bellman. In 1553, the crier was paid 13 old pennies for 'ridunge the banes' (reading the banns or adverts) for the Chester Mystery Plays. In 1598, bellman Richard Woodcock must have been dressed in a similar way to the London bellman, for he had 'a tymber mast typt at both endes and embellished in the middest with silver' (a wooden stick with silver decorations). 

In 1620, there was a fight at the crossroads between the butchers and the bakers where the 'Cryer brake his Mace in peeces Amonge them'(broke his silver stick among them). In 1607, one public notice read by George Tunnall, the bellman, that putting rubbish in the river was illegal. In 1715, a local man recorded that the 'Belman at the Cross ... Reads publicly a proclamation in the Mayor's name, commanding all persons in the City to bee of peaceable and civil behaviour, not to walk around the Streets or Rows at unreasonable hours of night'. In 1743, John Posnitt took over as 'Day and Night Bellman'.

In 1792, Chester had a day-time and night-time bellman, John Yarwood and a crier, William Ratcliffe, but by 1835 there seems to have been only one position. It was not until 1998 that Chester had both a crier and a bellman again.

Town criers were protected by royalty, as they sometimes brought bad news such as tax increases. To this day, any town crier in the British Commonwealth is protected under old English law that they are "not to be hindered or heckled while performing their duties". To injure or harm a town crier was seen as an act of treason against the ruling monarchy. The term "Posting A Notice" comes from the act of the town crier, who having read his message to the townspeople, would attach it to the door post of the local inn.

The same as England, town criers were the most important way to deliver news to the people of the town because many people could not read newspapers or write. Proclamations, local bylaws, market days, adverts, were all proclaimed by a bellman or crier.

Criers were not always men, many town criers were women. Bells were not the only way to make noise - in Holland, a gong was often used, and in France a drum was used, or a hunting horn.

The best dressed town crier and escort at the last World Championships (date of entry 2008) are Peter and Maureen Taunton from the county town of Stafford, UK. They also hold the title of the best dressed town crier in Britain 2008 Competition held at Alnwick for the Loyal Company of Town Criers. They are also the Best Dressed Crier at the National Town Crier Competition in Hastings 2007.

Peter Moore has been The London Town Crier for more than 30 years. He is Town Crier for The Mayor of London, The City of Westminster, and London Boroughs. He is also Freeman and Liveryman of The City of London.

Alan Myatt holds the world record as the loudest town cryer at 112.8 decibels.
The need for town criers has disappeared and they became part of the local folklore. There are European and World Championship competitions for modern town criers. The World Champion town crier is the town crier of Ninove, Hans Van Laethem.

Plague of Justinian

The Plague of Justinian was a pandemic in the Byzantine Empire in the years 541–542 AD. Its capital Constantinople suffered as well. It is estimated that the Plague of Justinian killed as many as 100 million people across the world, because it returned about every twelve years till 770 when it stopped for about 500 years. 

It caused Europe's population to drop by around 50% between 541 and 700. It also may have contributed to the success of the Muslim conquests.
Its social and cultural impact is comparable to that of the Black Death.

The plague may have come from Ethiopia or Egypt, and it was eventually carried north to the large city of Constantinople. Ships carrying grain, which the city imported, had many rats that carried the plague. 

At its height, the plague killed 10,000 people in Constantinople everyday. It eventually killed 40% of the city's population. In all, about 25 million people died because of the plague.

Plant cutting

Plant cutting, also known as striking/cloning, is a technique for vegetatively (asexually) propagating plants. With this method, a piece of the source plant containing at least one stem cell is placed in a suitable medium such as moist soil, potting mix, coir or rock wool. The cutting then grows new roots, stems, or both, and becomes a new plant independent of the parent.

Ferdinand Lassalle

Ferdinand Lassalle (11 April 1825 — 31 August 1864) was a German jurist and socialist politician.

Lassalle was born in Breslau. His father sent him to a business school in Leipzig. Lassalle changed to the University of Breslau. He later studied in Berlin.
He studied Philosophy, Philology (Latin and Ancient Greek) and Law.

Lassalle took part in the revolutions of 1848-49. He was put into prison and later banned from Berlin. He lived in Düsseldorf that time. In 1859, Lassalle returned to Berlin.

Lassalle was a liberal politician in the early 1860s. The liberals had some struggles with Otto von Bismarck. Lassalle thought about the living conditions of the working class. He found that the idea of self-help would not help the working class people. This led him to become a member of the Communist league. There he was in opposition to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. 

Lassalle founded the Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein (General German Workers' Association, ADAV) in 1863. This party later became the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).

Lassalle was killed in a duel.

Secret Water

Secret Water is the eighth book in Arthur Ransome's "Swallows and Amazons" series of children's books. It was published in 1939.

This book is set in and around Hamford Water in Essex, close to the resort town of Walton-on-the-Naze. It brings the Swallows and the Amazons together and introduces a new group of characters, the Eels and the Mastodon. Ransome sailed to Hamford Water, an area of salt marshes and low lying islands in his boat "Nancy Blackett". He set the book in this tidal place which offered a new setting for his characters and chances to explore and map the area.

The Swallows mean to sail in the "Goblin" to Hamford Water and camp with their father, but he is called away on naval business. Instead he maroons them with a small boat (dinghy) on an island. Before he leaves, Father gives them a basic map of the area they call Secret Water and suggests they map the area before he returns to pick them up. 
For a surprise, he has arranged for the Amazons to come down from the Lake District and join them with another dinghy.

They see some mysterious footprints which turn out to belong to the Mastodon, a local boy. He mistakes them for the Eels, another family who camp in the area regularly. Later the Eels arrive and are initially hostile before they settle down for a friendly war.

It seems that due to the distractions of war and being cut off by the tides, the chart will not be completed. However early in the last morning two separate groups of children complete it.

Brute force attack

In cryptanalysis, a brute force attack is a method of breaking a cryptographic system by trying a large number of possibilities using fast computers; for example, a large number of the possible keys in a key space in order to decrypt an encrypted message. 

The theoretical possibility of a brute force attack is recognized by the cryptographic system designers, they work to make the cryptographic system "computationally infeasible" to break using brute force attack. For that reason, one of the definitions of "breaking" a cryptographic scheme is to find a method faster than a brute force attack.

The selection of an appropriate key length depends on how much it will be difficult to break it using a brute force attack. By obfuscating the data before encryption, brute force attacks are less effective and more difficult to determine.

The brute force attack could be combined with a dictionary attack.

Information theory is a branch of applied mathematics and electrical engineering. Information theory measures the amount of information in data which could have more than one value. In its most common use, information theory finds physical and mathematical limits on the amounts of data in data compression and data communication. Data compression and data communication are statistical, because they guess unknown values. The amount of information in data measures how easily it is guessed by a person who does not know its value.

Block cipher

In cryptography, a block cipher is a symmetric key cipher which operates on a groups of bits of fixed length , called "blocks", using an exact transformation. During encryption, a block cipher algorithm might take (for example) a 128-bit block of plaintext as input, and output a corresponding 128-bit block of ciphertext. The exact transformation is controlled using a second input — the secret key. Decryption is similar: the decryption algorithm takes, in this example, a 128-bit block of ciphertext together with the secret key, and output the original 128-bit block of plaintext.

One of the early block cipher designs was the Data Encryption Standard (DES), developed at IBM and published as a standard in 1977. A successor to DES, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES); also using block cipher, was adopted in 2001.

Wassily Kandinsky ( – 13 December 1944) was a Russian painter, printmaker and art theorist. 

He was one of the most important and most famous 20th-century artists. He was a major figure in modern art and he is credited with painting the first modern abstract works. His art changed several times during his life. It was abstract, expressionist and constructivist in turn.

Born in Moscow, Kandinsky spent his childhood in Odessa. He enrolled at the University of Moscow and chose to study law and economics. Quite successful in his profession—he was offered a professorship (chair of Roman Law) at the University of Dorpat—he started painting studies (life-drawing, sketching and anatomy) at the age of 30. 

In 1896 he settled in Munich and studied first in a private school, then at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. He went back to Moscow in 1914 after World War I started. He was unsympathetic to the official theories on art in Moscow and returned to Germany in 1921. There he taught at the Bauhaus school of art and architecture from 1922 until the Nazis closed it in 1933. He then moved to France where he lived the rest of his life, and became a French citizen in 1939. He died at Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1944.

Public-key cryptography

Public-key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, is a form of cryptography in which the key used to encrypt a message differs from the key used to decrypt it. In public key cryptography, each user has a pair of cryptographic keys—a public key and a private key. The private key is kept secret, while the public key may be widely distributed and used by other users. Incoming messages would have been encrypted with the "recipient's public key" and can only be decrypted with his corresponding private key. The keys are related mathematically, but the user private key cannot be derived from the widely used public key. 

On the other hand, secret key cryptography, also known as symmetric cryptography, uses a single secret cryptographic key for both encryption and decryption. To use symmetric cryptography for communication, both the sender and receiver need to know the key earlier, or the key would have to be sent along with the message. 

The two main branches of public key cryptography are:

Muslim conquests

The first Arab Muslim conquests (632–732), (, Fatah, literally "opening",) also referred to as the Islamic conquests or Arab conquests, began after the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He established a new unified political polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the following Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from northwest India, across Central Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, southern Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula, to the Pyrenees. 

The Arab conquests brought about the collapse of the Sassanid Empire and a great territorial loss for the Byzantine Empire. Though spectacular, the Arab successes are not hard to understand in hindsight. The Sassanid Persian and Byzantine empires were militarily exhausted from decades of fighting one another. This prevented them from dealing effectively with the mobile Arab raiders operating from the desert. Moreover, many of the peoples living under the rule of these empires, for example Jews and Christians in Persia and Monophysites in Syria, were disloyal and sometimes even welcomed the Arab invaders, largely because of religious conflict in both empires.

Some of the individual conquests are mentioned here:

The Byzantine-Arab Wars were between the Byzantine Empire and at first the Rashidun and then the Umayyad caliphates.

Under the Rashidun there were the conquests of Syria (637), Armenia (639), Egypt (639) and North Africa (652). Under the Umayyads the continuing conquest of North Africa (665), the second Arab siege of Constantinople (717-718) and the conquest of Tbilisi (736). In 827 there followed the conquest of southern Italy (827).

The last ruler of the Sassanid Empire in Persia was defeated by the Rashidun in 633 and 636, but the final military victory didn't come until 642 when the Persian army was destroyed. 

During the seventh century the Umayyad fought successfully against the early Rajput in north India and in Central Asia. 

In 711, a Muslim expedition defeated Raja Dahir at what is now Hyderabad in Sindh and established Umayyad rule by 712. The Umayyad brought under control the whole of what is modern Pakistan, from Karachi to Kashmir and reached the borders of Kashmir within three years. But rather soon afterwards semi-independent Arab ruled states developed.

The conquest of the Iberian Peninsula began when the Moors (mostly Berbers with some Arabs) invaded Visigothic Christian Iberia (modern Spain, Portugal, Gibraltar, Andorra) in the year 711. They landed at Gibraltar on April 30 and worked their way northward. This territory, under the Arab name "Al-Andalus", became first an Emirate and then an independent Umayyad Caliphate after the overthrowing of the dynasty in Damascus by the Abbasids. In 1031 the territory split into small territiries, and gradually the Christian kingdoms started the Reconquest up to 1492, when Granada, the last kingdom of Al-Ándalus fell under the Spanish Kings.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, the Sahelian kingdom expanded Muslim territories far from the coast. Muslim traders spread Islam.

The modern era saw the rise of three powerful Muslim empires: the Ottoman Empire of the Middle East and Europe, the Safavid Empire of Persia and Central Asia, and the Mughal Empire of India; along with their contest and fall to the rise of the colonial powers of Europe.

The Mughal Empire declined in 1707 after the death of Aurangzeb and was officially abolished by the British after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

Key space

In cryptography, the key space of an algorithm refers to the set of all possible keys that can be used to initialize the cryptographic algorithm. For example, if an algorithm works using a key that is a string of 10 bits, then its key space is the set of all binary strings of length 10 bits; i.e. we have key space of size 2 = 1024.

To avoid attackers from guessing the key using a brute-force attack, the key space is usually designed to be very large. Another needed attribute is that the key space designed to be "flat", having no or very few weak keys.

The block cipher Rijndael/AES uses a key of up to 256 bits, resulting in a key space containing about 2 which is over 1.1579 × 10 keys. This makes it "computationally infeasible" to check each possible key by brute force.

In the DES block cipher, a 56-bit key is used, resulting in a relatively small key space of size 2.

The ROT13 cipher is only designed to prevent people from accidentally reading messages (e.g. movie plot details). As there is no key, the key space is therefore empty.

He is believed to have started the first or second Baptist church in the United States. He is known to have left the church soon afterwards, saying, "God is too large to be housed under one roof."

These are some famous descendants of Roger Williams:

Unitarianism

Unitarianism is a term that describes some forms of Christianity. Unitarianism can be described as the belief that God has one personality. This is different form what most other Christians think, called Trinitarianism. Unitarian Christians believe in Jesus of Nazareth. They think that Jesus was a great leader and prophet, but they generally do not think that Jesus is part of God himself.

The "Son of God" is a being that existed before Jesus' human life. It is called the Logos who dwelt with God in the beginning and then was born as the man Jesus. However, he is not eternal, but had a beginning of existence. God created him. This theology is commonly called Arianism, but there are many varieties of this form of Unitarianism. They range from the belief that the Son, before he came to earth, was a divine spirit of the same nature as God to the belief that he was an angel or other lesser spirit creature of a wholly different nature from God. Arius' views are only one variation of this theology.

Whatever the case, in this belief system, Jesus is beneath God, but higher than humans (and has always been so). This concept could be referred to as "elevated subordinationism." It is associated with early church figures such as Justin Martyr, Lucian of Antioch, Eusebius of Caesarea, Arius, Eusebius of Nicomedia, Asterius the Sophist, Eunomius, and Ulfilas, as well as Felix, Bishop of Urgel and others who believed that Jesus was God in his divine nature but his divinity in his human nature was through adoption. Arian forms of Unitarianism remain among Unitarians in Transylvania, Hungary, France, and several countries in Africa. Famous Arian Unitarians include Isaac Newton, Andrews Norton and Dr. William Ellery Channing.

Since the 19th century, several Evangelical or Revivalist movements also used an elevated subordinationist theology. This can be best described as Nontrinitarianism, rather than Unitarianism. Important figures include Barton W. Stone and Charles Taze Russell. Theologies among Evangelical Unitarians are sometimes classed as Arian, and sometimes Sabellian (Jesus is God in the flesh, the manifestation of God, who exists as a single person) and the Chinese based sabbatarian True Jesus Church. Other modern non-trinitarian churches, such as the Filipino-based Iglesia ni Cristo, may also be included, although they reject the "unitarian" name to avoid confusion. Jehovah's Witnesses also have a nontrinitarian theology with specific traits. The Christian Churches of God (CCG) is another Unitarian Church with a World Conference. It has a lot of material on Unitarian theology and history and holds the doctrine of the Pre-existence of Jesus Christ. CCG like other Sabbatarian Churches of God trace their ancestry back to the early church and follow biblical law. The CCG and Sabbatarians are sometimes erroneously called Arians due to the pejorative Trinitarian use of that term and also that of Subordinationists (see Bibliography).

This theology ranges from the belief that Jesus was merely a great man filled with the Holy Spirit (sometimes called Psilanthropism or, more commonly, Socinianism) to the belief that he is the incarnation of God's "impersonal" Logos. It is associated with early church figures like the Ebionites, Theodotus of Byzantium, Artemon, and Paul of Samosata in the early Church, Marcellus of Ancyra and his pupil Photinus in the 4th century AD, and Michael Servetus, Ferenc Dávid and Faustus Socinus in the Protestant Reformation. It is from the latter that we get the word "Socinianism," but the teaching of Socinus is unique in more than just its Christology, and so the name is best not used as merely a Christological term.

In modern times we see the psilanthropist view manifested in Rationalist Unitarianism, which emerged from the German Rationalism and the liberal theology of the 19th century. Its proponents took a highly intellectual and humanistic approach to religion. They rejected most of the miraculous events in the Bible (including the virgin birth.) They embraced evolutionary concepts, stated that man was good by default and abandoned the doctrine of biblical infallibility. Rationalist Unitarianism is distinguished from Deism (with which it nevertheless shares many features) by its belief in a personal deity who directly acts on creation, while Deists see God as holding aloof from creation.

Notable Rationalist Unitarians include Ralph Waldo Emerson and Theodore Parker in theology and ministry, Joseph Priestley and Linus Pauling in science, Susan B. Anthony and Florence Nightingale in humanitarianism and social justice, Charles Dickens in literature, and Frank Lloyd Wright in arts. Many Hungarian Unitarians embrace the principles of Rationalist Unitarianism—the only Unitarian high school in the world, John Sigismund Unitarian Academy in Cluj Napoca (Kolozsvár, Klausenburg), Romania, teaches Rationalist Unitarianism. The psilanthropist concept of the nature of Jesus is similar to the viewpoint held by the Islamic faith, which regards Jesus as a non-divine and human Prophet. The Christadelphians, the Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith and the Biblical Unitarians are Evangelical Unitarians.

Procopius of Caesarea (, c. 500 – c. 565) was a prominent Eastern Roman scholar. He took part in the wars of the Emperor Justinian I, and was the major historian of the 6th century AD, writing the "Wars of Justinian", the "Buildings of Justinian" and the celebrated "Secret History". He is commonly held to be the last major historian of the ancient world.

The writings of Procopius are the primary source of information for the rule of the Roman emperor Justinian. Procopius was the author of a history in eight books of the wars fought by Justinian I, a on Justinian's public works throughout the empire, and a book known as the "Secret History" (Greek: "Anekdota") that claims to report the scandals that Procopius could not include in his published history.

A number of historical novels based on Procopius' works (along with other sources) have been written, of which the best, "Count Belisarius", was written by poet and novelist Robert Graves in 1938.

The first Europeans in the Binda area were the explorers James Meehan and John Oxley in 1820. People began living in the area in the 1840's. Police were based at Binda in 1840 to protect local farmers from bushrangers. The town was begun in 1851. Blocks of land in the town were made ready for sale in 1852. It was the first town in the area to have a school, post office, police station and a courthouse. At Funny Hill, a sheep farm, a racing track for horses was made and the Binda Picnic Races began in 1848.

The elevators can only be reached by jumping and riding on platforms to reach the top of the sky. The platforms and elevators are guarded by creatures (also known as Zubs) but each planet has a different sub-species - for example the first level's Zub resembles a gyroscope whilst he fourth level Zub is a fish. The Zubs can be shot and stunned. They will float to the top of the sky where the recover and return to attack Zub again. The Green Eye of Zub was located on the tenth planet and once the Eye is found, Zub has to return to the first planet to give the Eye of Zub to Emperor Zub.

There are seven difficulty levels, each one increases the number of enemy Zubs per planet.

Canowindra, New South Wales

Canowindra (pronounced Can-noun-dra) is an historic town near Cowra in the central west of New South Wales, Australia. Canowindra is on the Belubula River. 

A post office opened in 1847. The mail came through Carcoar. It was not part of the road to the Lachlan because it didn't have a bridge.

In October 1863, bushranger Ben Hall's gang took over the village for three days. Everyone was held hostage in the hotel. The gang held a big party for everyone in the hotel. A monument to Ben Hall was put up in 1951 on the site of Robinson's hotel, the "Travellers' Rest". New research shows that the events happened at an hotel on the other side of the river.

The Royal Hotel is on the site of another hotel owned by Robinson. A sign on the wall says this was where Ben Hall's gang had their party. Other important buildings include the nursing home, the Junction Hotel, Finn's Building, the Victoria Hotel, the former Bank of NSW and the former CBC Bank. The Trading Post is a homewares shop that won a tourism award for 2006.

Canowindra is also known as the Balloon Capital of Australia. One of the largest festivals in Australia used to take place here every April. This was called Marti's Fiesta, which is no longer held due to lack of money.

Australian country music star Captain Flange makes his home in Canowindra.

The town is the site of one of the world's great fossil discoveries. A road worker in 1956 found 360 million year old fish fossils. These were from the Devonian period in the Paleozoic era. The "Canowindra slab" was taken to the Australian Museum, Sydney. The fish had been trapped in a pool of water that dried up. The fish found were two armoured antiarch placoderms, "Remigolepis walkeri" and "Bothriolepis yeungae." They also found "Canowindra grassi", a lobe-finned crossopterygian fish, with two rare young arthrodire placoderms, "Groenlandaspis" species.

More fossils were found in January 1993 using an excavator to dig down to the fossil layer. Many fish were preserved in detail. Specimens can be seen in the Age of Fishes Museum. This was built with support and funding from the Australian Museum. The Canowindra site has now been listed as part of Australia's National Heritage because of its international scientific importance.

United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare

The United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (also known as HEW) was a cabinet-level department of the United States government from 1953 until 1979. It was administered by the United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. In 1979, a separate Department of Education (ED) was created from this department, and HEW was renamed as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

President Harding proposed a Department of Education and Welfare as early as 1923, and similar proposals were also recommended by subsequent presidents, but for various reasons was not implemented.. It as only enacted as part of the "Reorganization Plan Number 1 of 1953", transmitted to Congress by Dwight D. Eisenhower on March 12, 1953.

To date, this was the only department of the U.S. government to be created through presidential reorganization authority, in which the president is allowed to create or reorganize bureaucracies as long as neither house of Congress passed a legislative veto. This power to create new departments was removed after 1962, but in the early 1980s the Supreme Court declared legislative vetoes unconstitutional.

United States Post Office Department

The Post Office Department is the former name of the United States Postal Service when it was a Cabinet department. It was headed by the United States Postmaster General.

The Postal Service Act signed by President George Washington on February 20, 1792 established the Department. Postmaster General John McLean was the first to call it the Post Office "Department" rather than just the "Post Office." The organization received a boost in prestige when President Andrew Jackson invited his Postmaster General, William T. Barry, to sit as a member of the Cabinet.

During the Civil War, postal services in the Confederacy were provided by the Confederate States of America Post Office Department, headed by Postmaster General John Henninger Reagan.

The Postal Reorganization Act signed by President Richard Nixon on August 12, 1970, replaced the cabinet-level Post Office Department with the independent United States Postal Service. The Act took effect on July 1, 1971.

United States Department of Housing and Urban Development

The United States Department of Housing, often abbreviated HUD, is a Cabinet department of the United States federal government. Although its beginnings were in the House and Home Financing Agency, it was founded in 1965 to develop and execute policy on housing and cities. It has largely scaled back its urban development function and now focuses primarily on housing.

The department was established on September 9, 1965 when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act into law. It stipulated that the department was to be created no later than November 8, 60 days following the date of enactment. The actual implementation was postponed until January 13, 1966, following the completion of a special study group report on the federal role in solving urban problems.

HUD is administered by the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The former administrator of the US Small Business Association, Steve Preston, was nominated to the Position of Secretary of HUD by President Bush on April 18, 2008. He was confirmed by the Senate and his public swearing in ceremony was on June 6, 2008.

Particle accelerator

A particle accelerator, also called an atom smasher or mass driver, is a machine that makes tiny things called particles travel at very high speeds. Accelerators work by pushing particles like electrons, protons, or nuclei with electric fields and by steering them with magnetic fields. 

The largest accelerators are used to study subatomic particles; smaller accelerators are used to study atomic nuclei (the big part at the middle of atoms) and make radioactive materials. There are two kinds of particle accelerators: linear accelerators and circular accelerators. Linear accelerators move the particles in a line, while circular accelerators move the particles in a circle. One example of a particle accelerator is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. It is very big, stretching through several countries. Another example is the Tevatron in the United States.

This helps people see particles smaller than an atom. Normally those particles cannot be seen, but they can in the particle accelerator. This is because in some ways energy and matter are the same thing. At the high speed created in these machines, some of the movement energy is changed into matter. It is the reverse (opposite) process that atomic weapons use. This being when matter is turned into energy. Small amounts of antimatter are also created during the process...

The particle accelerator at CERN was set up to search for the Higg's Boson particle, which would complete the Standard Model of Particle Physics.

Particle accelerators often use very advanced technology. This makes them cost a lot of money which is usually paid by governments.

The Reconquista (a Spanish and Portuguese word for "Reconquest"; Arabic: الاسترداد, "Recapturing") was a period of 800 years in the Middle Ages during which the several Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula expanded themselves (grew) by fighting the Muslim states of "al-Andalus" (Arabic الأندلس), the muslim states on the Iberian Peninsula, and pushing them out of the peninsula. 

The Reconquista began shortly after the Islamic conquest. Much of the ideology of the Reconquista was common to most Crusading: soldiers from all Europe travelled to Spain to fight the Muslims as an act of Christian repentance. 

The Reconquista came to an end on the 2 January 1492 with the capture of Granada. The last Muslim ruler of Granada surrendered (gave up) his kingdom to Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, the Catholic kings ("los Reyes Católicos"). This event marked the end of Muslim rule in Iberia.

<doc id="137121" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137121" title="Digital signature">
Digital signature

A digital signature or digital signature scheme is a type of asymmetric cryptography. For messages sent through an insecure channel, a good implementation of digital signature algorithm is the one that makes the receiver believe that the message was sent by the claimed sender, and trust the message. 

Digital signatures are equivalent to traditional handwritten signatures in many respects; properly implemented digital signatures are more difficult to copy than the handwritten type. Digital signature are implemented using cryptography. Digital signatures can also provide acknowledgement, meaning that the signer cannot successfully claim they did not sign a message, while also claiming their private key remains secret;

Digital signatures are often used to implement electronic signatures, a broader term that refers to any electronic data that holds a meaning of a signature, but not all electronic signatures use digital signatures. In some countries, including the United States, and in the European Union, electronic signatures may have legal significance. 

A digital signature system typically consists of three algorithms:


Two main properties are required by the digital signature system:

The GMR signature scheme:

In 1984, Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Ronald Rivest became the first to strictly define the security requirements of digital signature schemes. They described a hierarchy of attack models for signature schemes, they also present the GMR signature scheme. GMR scheme was proven to be secure against adaptive chosen-message attacks — even when an attacker receives signatures for messages of his choice, this does not allow him to copy a signature for a single additional message.

In their foundational paper, Goldwasser, Micali, and Rivest lay out a hierarchy of attack models against digital signatures:


They also describe a hierarchy of attack results:


The strongest notion of security, therefore, is security against existential forgery under an adaptive chosen message attack.

DIGITAL SIGNATURES

A digital signature is an electronic signature.

It can be used to authenticate the identity of the sender of a message.

It ensures that the original content of the message or document that has been sent is unchanged.

Digital signatures cannot be imitated by someone else.

It can be automatically time-stamped.

The sender too cannot deny sending the message whether it is encrypted or not.

It ensures the receiver of the sender's identity.

It demonstrates the authencity of a digital message or document.

These are commonly used for software distribution , financial transactions etc.

Digital signatures are equivalent to hand written signatures but are more difficult to forge than handwritten signatures.

USES OF DIGITAL SIGNATURES:

a) Authentication

b) Integrity

c) Non-repudition
a) Authentication:

Digital signatures can be used to authenticate the source of messages.
b) Integrity:

If a message is digitally signed , any change in the message after signature will invalidate the signature .

The message cannot be modified , and if modified a new message with a valid signature cannot be produced.

c) Non - repudation :

It is an important aspect of digital signatures.

A sender cannot deny having sent the document after signing it.

<doc id="137123" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137123" title="Key generation">
Key generation

Key generation is the process of generating keys for cryptography. The key is used to encrypt and decrypt data whatever the data is being encrypted or decrypted.

Modern cryptographic systems include symmetric-key algorithms (such as DES and AES) and public-key algorithms (such as RSA). Symmetric-key algorithms use a single shared key; keeping data secret requires keeping this key secret. Public-key algorithms use a public key and a private key. The public key is made available to anyone (often by means of a digital certificate). A sender will encrypt data with the public key; only the holder of the private key can decrypt this data.

Since public-key algorithms tend to be much slower than symmetric-key algorithms, modern systems such as TLS and its predecessor SSL as well as the SSH use a combination of the two in which: 

The simplest method to read encrypted data is a brute force attack—simply attempting every number, up to the maximum length of the key. Therefore, it is important to use a sufficiently long key length; longer keys take exponentially longer time to attack, making a brute force attack invisible and impractical. 

Currently, commonly used key lengths are:

In computer cryptography keys are integers. In some cases keys are randomly generated using a random number generator (RNG) or pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), the latter being a computer algorithm that produces data which appears random under analysis. Some types the PRNGs algorithms utilize system entropy to generate a seed data, such seeds produce better results, since this makes the initial conditions of the PRNG much more difficult for an attacker to guess. 

In other situations, the key is created using a passphrase and a "key generation algorithm", using a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-1.

Symmetric-key algorithm

Symmetric-key algorithms are a class of algorithms for cryptography that use trivially related, often identical, cryptographic keys for both decryption and encryption.

The encryption key is simply related to the decryption key, in that they may be identical or there is a simple relation between the two keys. The keys, in practice, represent a shared secret between two or more parties that can be used to maintain a private secure connection.

Other terms for symmetric-key encryption are secret-key, single-key, shared-key, one-key and eventually private-key encryption. Make sure that the use of the latter term does conflict with the term "private key" in public-key cryptography.

Symmetric-key algorithms can be divided into stream ciphers and block ciphers. Stream ciphers encrypt the bits of the message as a stream of bits one at a time, and block ciphers take a number of bits and encrypt them as a single unit. Blocks of 64 bits have been commonly used; though modern ciphers like the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm uses 128-bit blocks.

Symmetric ciphers have historically been susceptible to known-plaintext attacks, chosen plaintext attacks, differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis. 

Symmetric-keys are generated using the process of cryptographic keys generation, though it is recommended to use highly entropy systems to generate the initial seed.

Examples of popular symmetric cyphers include Twofish, Serpent, AES (aka Rijndael), Blowfish, CAST5, RC4, TDES, and IDEA.

Unlike symmetric algorithms, asymmetric key algorithms use a different key for encryption than for decryption. I.e., a user knowing the encryption key of an asymmetric algorithm can encrypt messages, but cannot derive the decryption key and cannot decrypt messages encrypted with that key. A short comparison of these two types of algorithms is given below: 

Symmetric-key algorithms are generally much less "computationally intensive" than asymmetric key algorithms. In practice, asymmetric key algorithms are typically hundreds to thousands times slower than symmetric key algorithms.

One disadvantage of symmetric-key algorithms is the requirement of a "shared secret key", with both parties holding the same copy at each end. 
In order to ensure secure communications between everyone in a group of n people a total of "n"("n" − 1)/2 keys are needed, which is the total number of possible communication channels.
To limit the impact of a potential discovery by a cryptographic attacker, they should be changed regularly and kept secure during distribution and in service. The process of selecting, distributing and storing keys is known as key management, and is difficult to achieve reliably and securely.

In modern cryptosystems designs, both asymmetric (public key) and symmetric algorithms are used to take advantage of the best of both. 
Asymmetric algorithms are used to distribute symmetric-keys at the start of a session. Once a symmetric key is known to all parties of the session, faster symmetric-key algorithms using that key can be used to encrypt the remainder of the session. This simplifies the key distribution problem, because asymmetric keys only have to be distributed authentically, while symmetric keys need to be distributed in both an authentic and confidential manner.

Systems that use such a hybrid approach include SSL, PGP and GPG, etc.

John Marshall

John Marshall (September 24, 1755 – July 6, 1835) was an American statesman and jurist who shaped American constitutional law and made the Supreme Court more powerful. Marshall was Chief Justice of the United States, working from February 4, 1801, until his death in 1835. He worked in the United States House of Representatives from March 4, 1799, to June 7, 1800, and, under President John Adams, was Secretary of State from June 6, 1800, to March 4, 1801. Marshall was from the Commonwealth of Virginia and a leader of the Federalist Party.

The longest working Chief Justice in Supreme Court history, Marshall ruled the Court for thirty years and was an important part of making the American legal system. His most important addition was judicial review, the power to stop laws that violate the Constitution. Marshall has been called the one that made the judicial branch special and powerful. Marshall also balanaced the power between the federal and state government. He made sure the federal law was more powerful than state law and agreed with an expansive reading of the enumerated powers.

Wikipedia:Rollback feature

Simple English Wikipedia's rollback feature is a given to fighters. It is given to as part of their work. It is a way to quickly undo vandalism made by the last user to change the page. 
Rollback can also be given to people who are not administrators. You may ask for rollback at or on an administrator's talk page.

Rollback is available to all Wikipedia , and there are with the . In total, editors have rollback rights. Apart from them, and also have access to rollback.

Rollback is a tool normally only used to reverse obvious . This is because it does not let you leave a change summary. Instead, the summary reads, "Reverted changes by X to last version by Y". It is done at once and does not need you to make sure you are doing it, which is different from the . 

Rollback may also be used to rollback changes by yourself. Unhelpful changes made in your userspace may also be rolled back. If you are not sure whether to use this tool on a single change, please use the undo feature. If you make an obvious mistake, or you need to revert your changes quickly, using rollback on yourself is also allowed. Generally, a person with rollback may also use it to revert their own edits in mainspace as long as those edits are a mistake and also not likely to cause a controversy.

Rollback must not be used to remove changes by other users. If the tool is used wrongly, it will be quickly removed by an administrator.

Rollback is the fastest way to undo vandalism, and does not put pressure on the servers. If the vandal made one change, the rollback button will change back to the older change just before the vandal. The rollback button will undo every change by the last user, so if the vandal changed it 6 times in a row, all six changes will be removed. If another user changed after the vandal, the rollback feature will change back to that user's changes, and will not undo all the changes by that user. 

The feature leaves an automatic change summary, for example: 

Because it is only for vandalism, the software automatically marks the change as "small" or "minor", hence the m.

You may ask for rollback at . You may also use the , or ask on an administrator's . Please note these rules:


The Simple English Wikipedia is a small set of regular users. Therefore, it does not get vandalized as often as other WMF projects, so a long history of regular vandal-fighting will not be needed. You just need to show that you know what vandalism is, and more importantly, know what it is not.

Testing the tool can be done at . Please do not test on other people's changes.

The rollback tool has an edit summary that is given by default. There are tools to let you change change summaries. One example is . Another example is . The second script asks editors for a change summary when using rollback. Both custom change summaries help other users when checking non-vandalism undos. Another one is . Another is .

<doc id="137175" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137175" title="Duke Nukem 3D">
Duke Nukem 3D

Duke Nukem 3D is a first-person shooter computer game. It was made by 3D Realms and sold by Apogee Software. It was first sold on January 29, 1996. "Duke Nukem 3D" is based on the main character from the platform games "Duke Nukem" and "Duke Nukem II" which were also published by Apogee. The character is voiced by Jon St. John.

In the game, players control Duke Nukem, an action hero from Earth. Players must fight invading aliens that want to take over Earth. The game is made up of 28 levels spread over three chapters. An add-on pack called "The Plutonium Pak", later added a fourth episode of 11 new levels, new enemies, and one new weapon.

The game is a first person shooter, so the player sees the game from Duke's eyes. Instead of following the character around like a third-person shooter, Duke Nukem is like being "inside" Duke, and the player can see Duke's hands and weapons on the screen. The player fights the aliens, most often by shooting at them with different guns, but Duke can also kick, and throw pipe bombs like grenades. The player must also sometimes solve puzzles to find the way through the level.

"Duke Nukem 3D" is set "sometime in the early 21st century", starting in a badly worn down Los Angeles. The game moves on to places such as lunar space stations. An alien transgenic species has invaded Earth while Duke has been fighting in space. Duke crash lands back on Earth and finds most humans are gone. Only a few women remain as slaves for the aliens. America has been turned into a wasteland, and pornography has become the only entertainment.

The levels of "Duke Nukem 3D" take the player outdoors and indoors, on the street, inside military bases, deserts, flooded cities, space stations, moon bases and Japanese villas. Levels were designed with many routes so that players can climb through air ducts, back doors and sewers to avoid enemies or find hidden secrets. This makes the levels well suited to multiplayer deathmatchs. The secret items also include (light switches to make it easier to see, water fountains and broken hydrants provide some health points) or simply provide a touch of diversion and strippers who Duke tells jokes to and sometimes they open up their clothes.

The game includes a range of weapons, some of which, even today, are still unique to the "Duke Nukem" series. They range from Duke's foot for kicking, a pistol, a "Chain gun" (similar in design to the Nordenfelt gun), pipe bombs, freeze- and shrink-rays, and laser-trip-mines.

Aside from weapons, Nukem can also find 'medkits' to heal himself whenever the player chooses. Steroids make the player move faster, as well as removing the effects of the shrink-ray. Nightvision goggles allow players to see enemies in the dark. The "HoloDuke" device projects a fake hologram of Duke that can be used to trick enemies. Protective boots allow the player to cross dangerously hot or toxic floors. For underwater scenes, scuba gear (an aqua-lung) can be used to let Duke breathe. One of the favorite items is the jetpack which allows the player to fly up in the sky, often to reach hidden weapons or extra health. Many of the secret items such as the jetpack, the scuba gear and the night vision goggles only last for a short time. Weapons also have a limited number of ammunition.

There are many monsters in the game. Some of these are aliens, others mutated humans (the LAPD has been turned into monster pigs). Similar to many first-person shooter games, Nukem encounters a large number of weaker enemies, and a small number of boss enemies (extremely powerful). Like Duke, these "boss" enemies have a wide range of weapons and equipment (some weaker enemies have jet packs).

In 1996, at the time of the game's release, Internet-based gaming was just beginning and "Duke Nukem 3D" could be played on IPX LAN or modem. "Duke Nukem 3D" players often used the IPX network utility Kali or the Total Entertainment Network (TEN) online service. Kali allowed users to join a chat room to find opponents. The Total Entertainment Network had hundreds of Duke 3D players online at any time, but players had to pay money monthly for it. The game's levels are often used as the battlegrounds for these online players, bur users are able to create their own levels ("maps"). The game also features co-operative play (co-op) which allows players to fight against the aliens instead of each other. In the "Atomic" version, a new game play mode was introduced: Duke Tag, a "capture the flag" style mode.

Ken Silverman's Build engine allowed complicated levels. The game could use slopes in the floors. It also supports upwards and downwards mouse aiming (though aiming up and down distorts the graphics due to not havingperspective correction).

Duke Nukem 3D "Build" engine had doors/walls that can move sideways. The "Build" scripting system allows a whole string of moving and sliding parts with sound effects, such as buildings falling down, earthquakes, and walls that break apart when hit with explosives. One of the more advanced effects is the horizontal sliding platform that can move the player inside a small sliding room, which made it possible to create subway cars moving in a timed sequence around a ring-shaped track.

The "Build" engine makes horizontally moving platforms possible by allowing several objects to pass through the same 2D space. While inside one of these spaces, it is not possible to see into the other space, and so the Byuild 2.5D engine has no problem rendering one space or the other even though the map data literally shows the two areas to be occupying the same place. Several "Duke Nukem 3D" maps use this feature to create bizarre mind-bending maps where multiple large rooms all seem to be occupying one 3D space. One secret level in particular ("Lunatic Fringe" from episode 2, Lunar Apocalypse) has a map where the player can travel 720 degrees around a circle and not cross their path. This would be much more difficult to duplicate with modern true-3D map editors and engines. 

An early beta (testing) version of "Duke Nukem 3D" called LameDuke was released by 3D Realms as a "bonus" one year after the release of the official version. It has been released as is, with no support, and is currently available to download from the 3DRealms FTP .

LameDuke features four episodes. Some weapons were removed and/or altered from the original versions.

"Duke Nukem 3D" is often thought of as one of the first videogames to have adult humor and sexual themes, especially in the first-person shooter genre. Jokes about American consumerism, Hollywood culture, and sex in the media are made all through the game. Duke's world is out of control and virtually all forms of entertainment in this future have been reduced to pornography by the aliens.

The game has been heavily attacked by some critics, who claim that it supports pornography and murder. Media Watch made the following comments about the game.
""Duke Nukem 3D" moves the 'shooter' through pornography stores, where Duke can use XXX sex posters for target practice. Duke throws cash at a prostituted woman telling her to 'Shake it, Baby' his gun ever ready. In the game bonus points are awarded for the murder of these mostly prostituted and partially nude women. Duke blows up stained glass windows in an empty church or goes to strip clubs where Japanese women lower their kimonos exposing their breasts. Duke is encouraged to kill defenseless, often bound women."— Media Watch, Teaching Boys To Kill"
In reality, Duke Nukem 3D does not contain a "bonus points" system; even accidental shooting of innocents in the game is, sometimes, punished by a sudden group of enemies attacking.

"Duke Nukem 3D" was banned in Brazil, along with "Quake", "Doom" and several other violent first-person shooters. As a response to complaints, censored versions of the game were sold in some countries to avoid being banned. In Germany, the BPjM placed the game on the "List of Media Harmful to Young People".

Many spin-offs and modifications to the original "Duke Nukem 3D" were produced after the game's initial launch.

Plutonium PAK/Atomic Edition: The Atomic Edition of "Duke Nukem 3D" was first sold in November 1996, and contained the original 3 episode game as well as a new eleven-level fourth episode. The Plutonium PAK was also sold as an upgrade package to convert the first available version of "Duke Nukem 3D" (v1.3d) to the new Atomic Edition (v1.4, later upgraded again to v1.5). It includes three new enemies: the Protector Drone, the Pig Cop Tank, and a new boss known as The Alien Queen. It also includes a new weapon, the Microwave Expander, with its own special ammunition. It also has several improvements to the software of the game, which allow the game's players to create new enemies and items. Also this version includes a computer controlled second player to simulate multiplayer games.

EDuke ("Enhanced Duke Nukem 3D"): created by Matthew Saettler was given away as a patch for Atomic Edition users on July 28, 2000. On this version 3D Realms removed the copyrights from the software so that players could do anything they liked with it and included a demo mod made by several beta testers. The demo included new Sector-Based Effects, Sprite-Based Elevators, Ladders, a Bouncing Particle Fountain, a Personal Teleporter, and a Sophisticated Translucent Water Effect. Saettler has kept records of his original Eduke site hee for reference.

Duke Caribbean: Life's a Beach: This is an add-on created by Sunstorm Interactive. Duke relaxes on a tropical island when he discovers that the aliens are having their own "vacation" there. This unofficial add-on has a sunny Caribbean atmosphere, nice beaches and hotels as well as some of the original Duke Nukem 3D stuff fit in. It includes levels created by Charlie Wiederhold, who later worked for 3D Realms to work on "Duke Nukem Forever", the upcoming sequel to "Duke Nukem 3D".

Duke it out in D.C.: In this storyline, President Bill Clinton is captured by alien forces, and it is up to Duke to save him. This pack has levels that are based on real locations of Washington DC, such as the White House, the FBI headquarters, the Smithsonian museum, and the Washington Monument and others. This game was also developed by Sunstorm Interactive.

Duke: Nuclear Winter: This one was developed by Simply Silly Software. In the storyline, Santa Claus is mind-controlled by aliens into causing trouble on Earth. Several of the levels take place near the North Pole. This game has sometimes been criticized for using content from the original Duke Nukem 3D.

Duke Xtreme: An add-on developed by Sunstorm Interactive and contained 50 levels and many items. This version had many technical problems.

Duke!Zone (Parts 1 and 2): Was sold by WizardWorks and had over 500 levels made by fans of Duke Nukem 3D. "Duke!ZONE II", contained three episodes designed by WizardWorks.

"Duke Nukem 3D" has been included in several compilations. A bundle called "East Meets West" included the full versions of "Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition" and "Shadow Warrior". A bundle called "Duke Nukem: Kill-A-Ton Collection" featured "Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition", "Duke Xtreme", "Duke!ZONE II", "Duke Nukem I" ("Duke Nukum"), "Duke Nukem II", and various other utilities. Both of these compilations are no longer sold. Earlier packages of "Duke Nukem 3D" also included the complete versions of "Duke Nukem" I and II as a bonus.

In 1998, 3D Realms filed a lawsuit against Micro Star over its add-on pack 
"Nuke It" and won. 

The source code to the "Duke Nukem 3D" v1.5 executable, which uses the Build engine, was released as free software under the GPL on April 1, 2003. The artwork remains copyright protected. Many programmers altered so that it can be played on modern computers. As of 2007, these projects gave the game a second life in multiplayer games through the Internet and a growing community is still actively playing.

The first modern "Duke Nukem 3D" project was from icculus.org. It is a cross-platform project that allows the game to be played on BeOS, FreeBSD, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, Windows and prossibly others. The icculus.org software would later be used in the Rancidmeat, and later, the xDuke projects.

One popular project is Jonathon Fowler's JFDuke3D, which the original creator of "'Duke Nukem 3D", Ken Silverman, gave support to, in December 2003. Fowler and Silverman produced a new version of JFDuke3D using Polymost, an OpenGL software product for Build, which uses much more advanced 3D models, and 32 bit color. Another project JFDuke3D called xDuke (not related to the xDuke project by icculus.org/duke3d) was created for play on the Xbox.

Silverman has helped Fowler with a lot of other software work related to the game. 

Here is a list of some of the most popular "Duke Nukem 3D" versions played in 2008:

Projects such as the "Duke Nukem 3D High Resolution Pack" were started to give the game the same quality as modern games. There are plans to continue enhancing the "'Duke Nukem 3D" software but no new versions of JFDuke3D have appeared since 2005.

A few projects have been created from the EDuke version (most notably WinEDuke and EDuke 2.1.1), but it was not until the release of Richard Gobeille's EDuke32 (a version of JFDuke3D using Saettler's EDuke software) in 2004 that EDuke became a the most popular with programmers. EDuke32 has been capable of playing OGG music since September 2007. A pack of music was compiled is planned to be part of future versions of the High Resolution Pack. In June 2008, EDuke32 became the first "Duke Nukem 3D" project to be played as 64-bit software thanks to the DOSBox team.

In 1997, "Duke Nukem 3D" versions were sold for all the major consoles of the time. 

The PlayStation version, "Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown", includes six extra areas and a secret level, which was also included in the PC version. It has some music from the PC version, some from the original, in Streaming XA-Audio made by Mark Knight, new enemies and a new boss.

The Sega Saturn version was created by Lobotomy Software and sold by Sega. It uses Lobotomy's "SlaveDriver" software. This version uses the Sega NetLink for online play, and is played with the Saturn's analog pad. It also includes a hidden multiplayer mini-game called "Death Tank Zwei". The Nintendo 64 version was named "Duke Nukem 64" and can be played by four players on a split-screen. There is no music in this version and many items have been renamed to avoid drug and sex references. Other changes include a fully 3D model for the final boss.

In 1998, a Sega Mega Drive version was sold by Tec Toy. The artwork is very simple and only one third of the original game was included. This version was sold in Brazil only. 

A version of "Duke Nukem 3D" was also released for the Game.com, Tiger's handheld system.

A Duke Nukem 3D version has been sold for Xbox Live since September 24, 2008. This version includes the ability to "rewind" the game to any point if Duke gets killed, video recording and online multiplayer games. The music is slightly better quality using modern MIDI tools.

The Two-Nation Theory was the basis for the Partition of India in 1947. It stated that Muslims and Hindus were two separate nations by every idealogical definition, and therefore Muslims should have an autonomous homeland in the Muslim majority areas of British India for the safeguard of their political, cultural, and social rights, within or without a United India.
However some Pakistanis including, a retired Pakistani Brigadier believe that the theory could only be disproved with the reunification of independent Bangladesh, and Republic of India.

Joseph Hewes

Joseph Hewes (January 23, 1730 November 10, 1779), was a native of Princeton, New Jersey, where he was born in 1730. Hewes’s parents were part of the Quaker Society of Friends. Immediately after their marriage they moved to New Jersey, which became Joseph Hewes’s home state. Hewes was formally educated at Princeton University and after college he became an apprentice to a merchant. After finishing his apprenticeship he earned himself a good name and a strong reputation, which helped him become one of the most famous signers of the Declaration of Independence for North Carolina, along with William Hooper and John Penn. After a few years as a successful merchant, he became very wealthy. Hewes moved to Edenton, North Carolina at the age of 30 and won over the people of the state with his charm and honorable businesslike character. Hewes was elected to the North Carolina legislature in 1763, only three years after he moved to the state. Second to the delegates of Massachusetts, Hewes was a pioneer of independence who influenced his state to be more rebellious during the years leading up to the American Revolution. After being re-elected many times to the legislature, Hewes focused on a new and more ambitious job as a Continental Congressman.

Candela

A candela measures how bright something is. It is one of the basic units of science. A light bulb is bright, but the Sun is much brighter, so the Sun has more candelas than the light bulb. Candelas are measured using green light, which human eyes are very sensitive to.

A candela sometimes has the name 'candle'.

Next time something like the SF issue comes up I think we should all ignore it. In the last ten minutes no registered user has edited any articles. It detracts from this encyclopedia and aside from that all this discussion just gives the user attention which nine times out of ten is what they want. Please can we make a concerted effort to ignore it next, myself included. 19:52, 19 October 2008 (UTC)

Cassandra; category work is important to Wikipedia. Don't diminish work or put some over other things. There is also nothing wrong with userspace work, and I know he worked on several articles in his subpages at one point. And he always admitted to his struggle with userspace editing, and tried to stop, even blanking his user page a few times.

Creol; each of your links were old ones, only one was within a month (Hin111), and even that was weeks ago. You bring them up in the heat of an argument, and you think we should punish him for them. Why didn't you block him when he made the changes? This would have been policy, but you are saying we should punish him for his past doings. ""[Blocks] are not intended for use in retaliation, as punishment, or where there is no current conduct issue which is of concern."" () These are old things, and you intend to punish him for them. -- () 20:06, 20 October 2008 (UTC)

All of his 'alternate' accounts have been indef blocked. If you see any others, indef them as well. However, I think we should leave SH (main account, IMO) blocked for only a week. Blocks are to warn, not to punish. He has been warned now, all his other accounts are gone and, when 1 week has passed, he'll be able to edit more carefully. -- 20:10, 19 October 2008 (UTC)
We should probably have consensus first deciding how long we should block. What does the community think? – () 20:34, 19 October 2008 (UTC)

The wheel warring needs to stop. A community ban was placed on him. AmericanEagle: I think you have too much involvement in this situation to be reverting an admins block. 20:33, 19 October 2008 (UTC)

I support an indefinite ban, in case it wasn't clear. Stirs up drama, doesn't contribute much articles wise. () 20:36, 19 October 2008 (UTC)

Hello all, 
as far as I am aware, ShockingHawk was frustrated about his RfA. In this mood, he made some unfitting comments on his talk page. Based on these comments, some rather heated discussion went on on IRC. Please let me clarify that this is his first offence.

Based on what what happened, we can reasonably justify a one-week ban (together with some event, see my talk page). We are currently heated up, which clouds our discussion.

For this reason, I think:

I hope you agree with me here. -- () 20:58, 19 October 2008 (UTC)
I'm actually trying to do COMM studying right now, and ran into the social penetration theory. One formula that arises out of it is this: the REWARDS - COSTS = OUTCOME. I'll plug that in right here. Little to no encyclopedic work - the need to constantly try to comfort him whenever he throws a tantrum = a lot of time wasted and no little gain at all. If he was a brilliant article writer I could see me going the extra length to calm him down, but I just don't see it here. As they would put it on en, the community's patience is exhausted. () 21:14, 19 October 2008 (UTC)


I support a ban, unless he accepts Matilda's mentorship, for an indefinite period of time. However, we should keep in mind that indefinite is not infinite and if he refuses to accept mentorship, he should be able to appeal the ban or propose suggestions. It is up to the community (do NOT read: small circle of admins) to decide whether he should be let in and be accepted back into Wikipedia, or stay banned. The ban is appropriate (even though Baseball16, ThePageChanger, and StaticFalcon were not sockpuppets, they were after his renames and "retirement") and I have been waiting for a long time, I just remained quiet as I didn't want to cause drama (meaning American Eagle to come rushing to his defense). Note that WR has a thread about this whole affair, with only one reply at the current moment. It calls StaticFalcon a drama queen, and says we shouldn't tolerate it. I disagree, we should be negotiable, but this has gone too far. If he wants to change, he should accept the mentorship and cut out the fake 1-day "retirements" and temper tantrums. —  ( · ) 02:52, 20 October 2008 (UTC)

I'm with Giggy and Matilda on this one. The only way I'd want to see him back as an editor, is through mentorship. Matilda is willing, I suggest we see where it takes him. 02:57, 20 October 2008 (UTC)

Hiya there, I havent written here for almost half a day. It is clear that some of us are able to better communicate with other people than others. This is however no excuse for comments that seem unfitting, and it is definitely no reason to not be able to contribute to a Wikipedia project, where the first aim should be to get together knowledge, and to present this knowledge to our target group. You do not need to interact with the people, you just need to fix the problems some article might have. Hence, problems with social interaction (however you call them) are a hindrance to contribute here. Also note that "communicating" with other people is something that can be taught and learnt. -- () 10:48, 20 October 2008 (UTC)

OK, apart from a spot of redirecting Static's accounts to his main username, I've kept out of the argument that's escalating here. After reading this whole, massive section, I feel that prehaps Simple English Wikipedia has stopped being that safe haven from English Wikipedia that has drawn many of our editors here. Many users have just gone on wikibreak because of this, and I can't help wondering if it really is worth it. I sincerely hope that Simple English Wikipedia recovers from this, and that this current crisis blows over as soon as possible. What this seems to boil down to is not "Does blocking StaticFalcon help Wikipedia?" but "Does unblocking StaticFalcon help Wikipedia?". We are in no position, it seems, to be able to judge with a level head. Let's all stop, and then reconsider when everything has all cooled down. All Wikipedians involved in this argument should remember that, afterwards, we cannot afford to bear grudges. Wikipedia is fragile enough as it is. Please think of the Wikipedia as a whole, not as just the individual users. Yours, Microchip • 19:11, 20 October 2008 (UTC)

I acknowledge that mentorship might be a difficult task. I concur that "If this doesn't work, you can have his head (sort of speak)." What I see as different about the mentoring that I offer is a focus on teaching him how to contribute as an editor. Part of the adoption process by Kennedy of Ric can be seen as - these questions, say about deletion or other policy issues, are applicable to someone only who is already contributing as an editor. Ric apparently wants to be a wikipedian but doesn't know how. There will be no joking around. Other than the user page, I am unaware as to what Kennedy offered to Ric as an adopter. I am aware that others have made suggestions about contributions to Ric, including that he should not copy text from en and he did not heed their suggestion nor did he react positively or politely. From me, there will be a focus on editing - contributing in accordance with policy - ensuring is met by citing , thinking about the readership. If either Ric or the community don't want this - that is fine with me. In response for mentoring, I expect Ric to be polite and receptive. Instead of mentoring Ric, I am quite happy to continue contributing here and at en and I even have a life outside wikipedia! From early December I may well be less available on wikipedia for a couple of months than I am now - in other words I will have less time to focus on mentoring than I do over the next 6 weeks. -- () 20:29, 21 October 2008 (UTC) 

As the original IP block was only set to 31 hours, the IP was used to evade to accounts blocked. As such, I re-set the block on the IP for one week from today.

I will shortly make another update to the page it will work on, , changing the current translation with the current translation! (just to see if it works),

Are the community happy with this?

After a few weeks succesful running I will request a bot flag.

Thanks,

Ok, there's a discussion above, but i'm now formally proposing it.

My ideas can be found at and subpages. Please comment.

It is far from ready imo, but i'd now like to get the community's input to make this great.

Feel free to discuss here, on the talk pages there, or even better just make the changes!

And then I suppose, as usual, we should have a !vote here, so one is below!

Thanks,


Hey,

Just to clarify, i'd be willing to run it myself once a week, as long as suggestions are made by other users. I'd be happy to make the updates etc. Also, it probably is still a bit complicated, so please do suggest ways of making it simpler!!!

Hey all,

Just thinking, is there consensus for it? Personally, i'd find it very useful for vandal fighting etc. What do others think? It may have been discussed before. If it has, then sorry!

If consensus is found I will open a bug for the devs to add it.

A poll is open below, to run for one week (unless we feel consensus is found before then!)

Thanks,

NOTE 

A bug has been filed already. It's just that the devels haven't started processing on them yet :P. I have heard that we have to wait for a few more weeks.     13:39, 20 October 2008 (UTC)


I would like it if someone could give me a tutorial on how to make/run a bot. I don't actually want to do it right now but it's something I would like to know how to do. I am totally clueless on this subject by the way so I would need quite a bit of instruction. 20:01, 20 October 2008 (UTC)

The project has barely covered anything but it is well underway and has a dozen members headed by on the page . So far only a few articles have been produced by the new project but i can say that of a dozen or so video game articles that I have created almost every one has been spellchecked and categorised or added to by members of this project.
I suggest that WikiProject Video games is approved of in general and an admin should move the page to after a swift vote. ~ .. 09:13, 21 October 2008 (UTC)


 per all above comments. I cant be bothered to type it all out what I think because we will be here all night but I oppose it from the comments above. () 15:10, 22 October 2008 (UTC)

Regarding maintaining activity. Vandalism/reversion is the most active project at present (on any wiki). On simple.wiki there is a unique requirement to lower the bar or have absolutely no projects at all and be a random jumble. Please support all projects covering a wide range of valid wiki information with a view to appearing correctly structured thus increasing interest in this wiki. Certain topics need their ball rolled and although this is an unusual place to begin such a debate, it is such a topic. Games are more similar in the modern world to music and movies than anything else. Please open the project pages of all major notable topics for a little correctness and encouragement. This wide ranging topic is certainly not suitable for a personal user space except as a personal project. This project is the only one on video games and is open to the public. Give us our shop front as a sign of respect please, and consider this to be a sign that all major topics will have a project page where one is lacking, also as a sign of respect and to encourage its growth. Set a limit that any person creating a project page should show signs of activity in the area (i.e. do not allow people to create project pages they are not involved with). I will vouch for the page as it is now and challenge anyone to find a signifigantly larger contribution to video game related articles than mine. ~ .. 23:15, 22 October 2008 (UTC)
To bring some perspective I have selected a wikiproject at random from en.wiki as an example of inactivity and yet this project has been open for 2 years http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Prince_Edward_Island any thoughts? ~ .. 04:27, 23 October 2008 (UTC)

wtf does democratic mean? 

Should we have DYK credits? DYK credits are templates like the one on my . There are used to "award" users for their work in finding DYKs. Should we have them here, or (since it is rather easy to find DYKs here) should we not have them? – () 02:45, 23 October 2008 (UTC)

Known-plaintext attack

The known-plaintext attack (KPA) is an attack model for cryptanalysis where the attacker has samples of both the plaintext and its encrypted version (known as ciphertext version) then he can use them to expose further secret information after calculating the secret key. 

Encrypted file archives such as ZIP are very prone to this attack. For example, an attacker with an encrypted ZIP file needs only one unencrypted file from the archive which forms the "known-plaintext". Then using some publicly available software they can instantly calculate the key required to decrypt the entire archive.

Classical ciphers are typically susceptible to known-plaintext attack. For example, a Caesar cipher can be solved using a single letter of corresponding plaintext and ciphertext to decrypt entirely.

<doc id="137351" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137351" title="Chosen-plaintext attack">
Chosen-plaintext attack

A chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) is an attack model for cryptanalysis which assume that the attacker has the capability to choose random plaintexts to be encrypted and obtain the corresponding ciphertexts. The goal of the attack is to gain some further information which reduces the security of the encryption scheme. In the worst case, a chosen-plaintext attack could expose secret information after calculating the secret key. 

Modern cryptography, is implemented in software or hardware and is used for a diverse range of applications; for many applications, a chosen-plaintext attack is often very feasible. Chosen-plaintext attacks become extremely important in the context of public key cryptography, where the encryption key is public and attackers can encrypt any plaintext they choose.

Any cipher that can prevent chosen-plaintext attacks is then also guaranteed to be secure against known-plaintext and ciphertext-only attacks; this is a conservative approach to security.

Two forms of chosen-plaintext attack can be distinguished:




</doc>
<doc id="137354" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137354" title="Ciphertext-only attack">
Ciphertext-only attack

In cryptography, a ciphertext-only attack (COA) or known ciphertext attack is an attack model for cryptanalysis where the attacker is assumed to have access only to a set of ciphertexts. 

The attack is completely successful if the corresponding plaintexts can be deduced (extracted), or even better, the key. The ability to obtain any amount of information from the underlying ciphertext is considered a success. 

Every modern cipher attempts to provide protection against ciphertext-only attacks. The process of Selecting a new cipher design standard usually takes many years and includes exhaustive testing of large quantities of ciphertext for any statistical different approach from random noise. On the other hand poor cipher depends on home-grown proprietary algorithms that have not been subjected to extensive testing and inspection; for this reason many computer-age encryption systems are still subject to ciphertext-only attack but still in use. Examples include:





</doc>
<doc id="137359" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137359" title="Chosen-ciphertext attack">
Chosen-ciphertext attack

A chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) is an attack model for cryptanalysis in which the cryptanalyst gathers information, at least in part, by choosing a ciphertext and obtaining its decryption under an unknown key. 

When a cryptosystem is susceptible to chosen-ciphertext attack, implementers must be careful to avoid situations in which an attackers might be able to decrypt chosen ciphertexts (i.e., avoid providing a decryption scheme). This can be more difficult than it appears, as even partially chosen ciphertexts can permit subtle attacks. Additionally, some cryptosystems (such as RSA) use the same mechanism to sign messages and to decrypt them. This permits attacks when hashing is not used on the message to be signed. A better approach is to use a cryptosystem which is provably secure under chosen-ciphertext attack, including (among others) RSA-OAEP, Cramer-Shoup and many forms of authenticated symmetric encryption.

Chosen-ciphertext attacks, like other attacks, may be adaptive or non-adaptive. In a non-adaptive attack, the attacker chooses the ciphertext or ciphertexts to decrypt in advance, and does not use the resulting plaintexts to inform their choice for more ciphertexts. In an adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack, the attacker makes their ciphertext choices adaptively, that is, depending on the result of prior decryptions.

A specially noted variant of the chosen-ciphertext attack is the "lunchtime" or "midnight" attack, in which an attacker may make adaptive chosen-ciphertext queries but only up until a certain point, after which the attacker must demonstrate some improved ability to attack the system. The term "lunchtime attack" refers to the idea that a user's computer, with the ability to decrypt, is available to an attacker while the user is out to lunch. This form of the attack was the first one commonly discussed: obviously, if the attacker has the ability to make adaptive chosen ciphertext queries, no encrypted message would be safe, at least until that ability is taken away. This attack is sometimes called the "non-adaptive chosen ciphertext attack" ; here, "non-adaptive" refers to the fact that the attacker cannot adapt their queries in response to the challenge, which is given after the ability to make chosen ciphertext queries has expired. 

Many chosen-ciphertext attacks of practical importance are lunchtime attacks, including, for instance, when Daniel Bleichenbacher of Bell Laboratories demonstrated a practical attack against systems using the PKCS #1; invented and published by RSA Security.

A (full) adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack is an attack in which ciphertexts may be chosen adaptively before and after a challenge ciphertext is given to the attacker, with ONE condition that the challenge ciphertext may not itself be queried. This is a stronger attack notion than the lunchtime attack, and is commonly referred to as a CCA2 attack, as compared to a CCA1 (lunchtime) attack. Few practical attacks are of this form. Rather, this model is important for its use in proofs of security against chosen-ciphertext attacks. A proof that attacks in this model are impossible implies that any practical chosen-ciphertext attack cannot be performed. 

Cryptosystems proven secure against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks include the Cramer-Shoup system and RSA-OAEP.

Kambly is a Swiss biscuit factory. It was founded in 1910 by Oscar Kambly. 

He got to know a girl that lived in Trubschachen. It was a real lovestory. When he went at her home he had the idea to make a biscuit after his grandmother's recipe, this was in 1906. In 1910 he could absorb the store of his instructor.

Today, Kambly is Switzerland's largest biscuit producer and leading exporter. 
Kambly is represented in more than 30 different countries. 
It is the most famous and most liked biscuit brand of Switzerland's. 
There are two factories, one in Trubschachen and one in Lyss, both in the canton of Berne. 
Today it's Oscar Kambly the third who administrates the factory, he has done this since 1983. 
Oscar Kambly who founded the factory leaded it from 1910-1953. 
The first factory was only in Trubschachen, but because Kambly bought 
the Arni AG in Lyss in 1999, they now have got another station. 
There are 420 employees. 2007, there was a conversion of 164 million Swiss francs. Kambly got the award "Brand Excellence Swiss Trophy" in 2003. In 2003, 2005,2007 & 2008 the international price "Saveur de l'Année".

There are 2 factory stores. One in Lyss and another one in Trubschachen.
There you can buy the biscuits much cheaper.

The oldest product is the "Bretzeli", that has been produced since 1906 and that was invented by Oscar Kambly the first.
Some other known products are: "Biscuits Butterfly", "Caprice", "Mignon" and the "Petit Beurre".
They also produce salted biscuits.

Differential cryptanalysis

Differential cryptanalysis is a general form of cryptanalysis applicable to block ciphers, but also can be applied to stream ciphers and cryptographic hash functions. It is the study of how differences in the input can affect the resultant differences at the output. In the case of a block cipher, it refers to a set of techniques and methods for tracing differences through the network of transformations, discovering where the cipher demonstrates non-random behaviour, and extend such properties to recover the secret key.

Differential cryptanalysis attacks are usually chosen plaintext attacks, meaning that the attacker must be able to obtain encrypted ciphertexts for some set of plaintexts of his choosing.

In cryptography, linear cryptanalysis is a general form of cryptanalysis based on finding affine approximations to the action of a cipher. Attacks have been developed for block ciphers and stream ciphers. Linear cryptanalysis is one of the two most widely used attacks on block ciphers; the other being differential cryptanalysis.

A variety of refinements to the attack have been suggested, including using multiple linear approximations or including non-linear expressions. 

Evidence of security against linear cryptanalysis is usually expected of new cipher designs.

Tropical Storm Cristobal (2008)

Tropical Storm Cristobal was the third tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. It began on July 19 as a weather system away from the Southeast U.S. Coast. It became a tropical storm later that day. Cristobal stayed away from land, and reached its highest strength as a strong tropical storm on July 21. It moved to the northeast next to the U.S. East Coast and died out on July 23 near Nova Scotia. Because it was a weak storm and never moved onto land, Cristobal's damages were mostly moderate rainfall. The storm dropped 3.43 in (87 mm) of rain in Wilmington, North Carolina, where minor flooding happened. Also, the remnants helped produce rainfall on Nova Scotia, which caused some flooding on roads and in basements.

On July 14, 2008 a weakening weather system stretched across northern Florida, causing thunderstorms. A weak low pressure area formed on July 15 near Tallahassee, which moved towards the southeast into the Gulf of Mexico. Late on July 16, it moved onto land near Tampa, and strengthening was not expected. However, late on July 17, thunderstorms became stronger around the low pressure area, and the system started to get better organized. Late on July 18, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that a tropical depression was forming. At 11 p.m. EST on July 18 (0300 UTC July 19), it was classified as Tropical Depression Three, about 65 miles (105 km) to the southeast of Charleston, South Carolina.
It was located between an area of high pressure to its southeast and another one to the northwest, the depression moved slowly towards the northeast. It became a weak tropical storm during the early afternoon of July 19. In the beginning, the storm was not strong, with few strong thunderstorms. Dry air in the middle- to-upper-levels of the atmosphere caused the storm to not strengthen. However, late on July 20 thunderstorms became more active. Cristobal stayed as a weak tropical storm during the time that it moved close to the South Carolina and North Carolina coast, and the storm never moved onto land. It reached its highest intensity as a strong tropical storm on July 21 while it passed east of Cape Hatteras, and stayed the same over the warm Gulf Stream. The storm started to enter cooler waters, and the cyclone quickly moved towards the east-northeastward on July 21 and July 22. In the afternoon of July 22, Cristobal began to weaken while to the south of Nova Scotia. The storm's cloud pattern became weak, and on July 23, it became an extratropical cyclone, and was no longer a tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on the system at 5:00 am EDT (0900 UTC) on July 23.

Before the storm, the National Hurricane Center started a tropical storm warning from Cape Lookout, North Carolina to the Virginia–North Carolina border. Before Cristobal formed, it produced light rain in Florida. At Lake Wales, about 6 inches (150 mm) of rainfell, mostly in a two hour period. The rain clogged storm drains, which caused light flooding. The rain caused no serious problems, and helped get rid of dry conditions. The storm dropped in Wilmington, North Carolina. Minor flooding happened there. Because most of the storm stayed out to sea, winds along the coast were light. On the coast, storm surge reached above normal. Winds that were of tropical storm-strength were reported offshore. No severe damage was reported.

Cristobal helped produce heavy rain and flooding in Atlantic Canada. At Baccaro Point on the southern tip of Nova Scotia, 224 mm (8.8 in) of rain fell. There was flooding to basements and streets in Cape Sable. A sailor from Connecticut was rescued to the southeast of Halifax by a Canadian helicopter, because his ship capsized in the strong waves.

The band's genre is mostly a combination of alternative rock, alternative hip hop, and electronica. It also has elements of experimental, trip hop, dub, and psychedelic rock.

Since they are an animated group, they cannot perform live like real bands can. At Gorillaz concerts, the real members of the band stand behind screens which show computer-generated images of the animated group performing.

Kaiserswerth is a settlement with a more than 1,000-year history.
It is one of the oldest parts of Düsseldorf. 

It is in the north of Düsseldorf, next to the river Rhine. 
Kaiserswerth has 7,712 inhabitants and an area of 4.71 km².

About the year 700 the monk St. Suitbert founded a Benedictine-abbey there.
It was destroyed 88 years later.

The Kaiserpfalz (temporary seat of the Holy Roman Emperor) was built in 1045. 

In 1062 the young German King Heinrich IV (still a child) was kidnapped by the archbishop of Cologne. 

In 1174 Friederick I Barbarossa moved the Rhine customs collection to Kaiserswerth. So the bishop took over control over the whole empire.

Following emperors used Kaiserswerth as temporary seat like as prison for high-range prisoners.

Between 1212 and 1215 the Count of Berg tried to get out prisoners and made the ground around the Castle dry.

In 1273 the Emperor pledged Kaiserswerth to the archbishop of Cologne.

In 1689 Kaiserswerth was particularly destroyed by France during the War of the Palatine Succession. During the Spanish war of succession the Bishop of Cologne stayed with France.

Kaiserswerth got a French garrison. In 1702 the city was therefore besieged by the Grand Alliance. After that war the castle was mostly destroyed.

In the 19th century Kaiserswerth was famous by its deaconess clinic. Florence Nightingale visited in 1850 and learned from Pastor Theodor Fliedner and the deaconesses working there for the sick and the deprived. Nightingale published "The Institution of Kaiserswerth on the Rhine, for the Practical Training of Deaconesses, etc." in 1851 - her first publication.

Kaiserswerth became a part of Düsseldorf in 1929.

Mechanical energy

In physics, mechanical energy describes the potential energy and kinetic energy present in the components of a mechanical system.

When a given amount of mechanical energy is transferred (such as when throwing a ball, lifting a box, crushing a soda can, or stirring a beverage) it is said that this amount of mechanical work has been done. Both mechanical energy and mechanical work are measured in the same units as energy in general. It is usually said that a component of a system has a certain amount of "mechanical energy" (i.e. it is a state function), whereas "mechanical work" describes the amount of mechanical energy a component has gained or lost.

The conservation of mechanical energy is a principle which states that under certain conditions, the total mechanical energy of a system is constant. This rule does not hold when mechanical energy is converted to other forms, such as chemical, nuclear, or electromagnetic. However, the principle of general conservation of energy is so far an unbroken rule of physics - as far as we know, energy cannot be created or destroyed, only changed in form.

Vitiligo

Vitiligo is a long lasting skin disease that causes the losing of color from the skin. It occurs when the melanocytes, cells that give skin their color, die or do not work.

The exact cause of vitiligo is complex and not fully understood. It may be caused by the immune system, genetic, and environmental factors. 
Vitiligo may also be caused by stress that affects the immune system, leading the body to react and start eliminating skin pigment.

People over 20 years old rarely develop this disease. These patches often occur to both sides symmetrically and may change shape.


This disease can also affect the mental state of the patient. 

Today, doctors do not understand what causes the disease, so right now, it can not be cured. Some things can be done to fight its effects, though. Makeup or cosmetics can cover up the parts of the skin with vitiligo. Also, staying out of the sun to prevent tanning is good. But the treatment given by most skin doctors is cortico steroid cream.
Breakthrough discovery in 2004 allowed for the transplant of melanocytes to vitiligo affected areas, repigmenting the region.

Virtue (Latin "virtus"; Greek ) is a kind of behaviour which is thought to be good. The adjective is "virtuous". Someone who lives a virtuous life is someone who leads a good moral life, doing things that society thinks are good. The opposite of virtue is vice. 

Philosophers throughout the ages have written their ideas about what they think virtue is. The Ancient Greek philosophers from Plato onwards said that virtue consisted of four things: Justice, Courage, Wisdom, and Moderation. In the Christian religion the three virtues were Faith, Hope and Charity. These are mentioned in the Bible in the First Book of Corintheans, ch13,v.13. These virtues are also very important in the Judaic and Muslim traditions.

Twofish

In cryptography, Twofish is a symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 128 bits and key lengths up to 256 bits. 

In 1997, the NIST announced for competition to choose a successor to DES to be known as AES, Twofish was one of the "five finalists" of the Advanced Encryption Standard competition, but was not selected as a standard. 

Twofish is related to the earlier block cipher Blowfish. Twofish's main features are the use of pre-computed key-dependent S-boxes, and a relatively complex key schedule. One half of an n-bit key is used as the actual encryption key and the other half of the n-bit key is used to modify the encryption algorithm (key-dependent S-boxes). Twofish uses some elements from other designs; for example, the pseudo-Hadamard transform (PHT) from the SAFER family of ciphers. Twofish uses the same Feistel structure as the DES.

On most software platforms Twofish is slightly slower than Rijndael (the chosen algorithm for Advanced Encryption Standard) for 128-bit keys, but somewhat faster for 256-bit keys.

Twofish was designed by Bruce Schneier, John Kelsey, Doug Whiting, David Wagner, Chris Hall, and Niels Ferguson; the "extended Twofish team" who met to made further cryptanalysis of Twofish and other AES competitors included Stefan Lucks, Tadayoshi Kohno, and Mike Stay.

Twofish algorithm is free for anyone to use without any restrictions whatsoever. The Twofish cipher has not been patented and the software example of its specification has been placed in the public domain. However, Twofish is not widely used like the Blowfish, which has been available for a longer period of time.

As of 2008, the best published cryptanalysis on the Twofish block cipher is a truncated differential cryptanalysis of the full 16-round version. The paper claims that the probability of truncated differentials attacks is 2 per block and that it will take about 2 chosen plaintexts (32 PiB worth of data) to find a good pair of truncated differentials.

Bruce Schneier responds in a 2005 blog entry that this paper does not present a full cryptanalytic attack, but only some hypothesized differential characteristics: "But even from a theoretical perspective, Twofish is not even remotely broken. There have been no extensions to these results since they were published" in 2000.

Fatimid Caliphate

The Fatimid Caliphate was ruled by the al-Fātimiyyūn dynasty from 5 January 909 to 1171. It was an Arab Shi'a dynasty It ruled the fourth and final Arab caliphate. In different times different areas of the Maghreb, Egypt, and the Levant belonged to the caliphate. 

The Fatimids established the Egyptian city of Cairo as their capital. The term "Fatimite" is sometimes used to refer to the citizens of this caliphate as well. The ruling elite of the state belonged to the Ismaili branch of Shi'ism. The leaders of the dynasty were also Shia Ismaili Imams. They had a religious significance to Ismaili Muslims. They are also part of the chain of holders of the office of Caliph, as recognized by most Muslims, the only period in which the Shia Imamate and the Caliphate were united to any degree. (With the only other exception: the Caliphate of Ali himself.)

The Fatimids were famous for religious tolerance towards non-Ismaili sects of Islam as well as towards Jews, Maltese Christians and Coptic Christians, but there were some exceptions nevertheless.

The Fatimids had their origins in Ifriqiya (modern-day Tunisia and eastern Algeria). The dynasty was founded in 909 by , who legitimised his claim through descent from Muhammad by way of his daughter Fātima as-Zahra and her husband , the first Imām, hence the name "al-Fātimiyyūn" "Fatimid".

Abdullāh al-Mahdi's control soon extended over all of central Maghreb, an area consisting of the modern countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, which he ruled from Mahdia, his newly-built capital in Tunisia.

In the 1040s, the Zirids (governors of North Africa under the Fatimids) declared their independence from the Fatimids and their conversion to Sunni Islam, which led to the devastating Banū Hilal invasions. After about 1070, the Fatimid hold on the Levant coast and parts of Syria was challenged first by Turkish invasions, then the Crusades, so that Fatimid territory shrank until it consisted only of Egypt. 

After the decay of the Fatimid political system in the 1160s, the Zengid ruler Nūr ad-Dīn had his general, Shirkuh, seize Egypt from the vizier Shawar in 1169. Shirkuh died two months after taking power, and the rule went to his nephew, Saladin. This began the Kurdish Ayyubid Dynasty.

In cryptography, plaintext is the information which the sender want to transmit to the receiver(s). Before computers, plaintext simply means text in the language of the communicating parties. Since computers, the definition has been expanded to include not only the electronic representation of text, such as emails and word processor documents, but also the computer representation of speech, music, pictures, videos, ATM and credit card transactions, sensor data, and so forth, basically any information which the communicating parties might wish to hide from others. The plaintext is the normal representation of the data before any action has been taken to hide it.

The plaintext is used as input to an encryption algorithm; the output is termed ciphertext. In some systems, however, multiple layers of encryption are used (called rounds), in which case the ciphertext output of one encryption algorithm becomes the plaintext input to the next.

<doc id="137536" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137536" title="Stream cipher">
Stream cipher

In cryptography, a stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher where plaintext bits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher bit stream (keystream) using an exclusive-or (xor) operation. In a stream cipher the Plaintext digits are encrypted one at a time, and the transformation of successive digits varies during the encryption state. An alternative name is a state cipher, as the encryption of each digit is dependent on the current state. In practice, the digits are typically single bits or bytes.

Stream ciphers represent a different approach to symmetric encryption from block ciphers. Block ciphers operate on large blocks of fixed length. Stream ciphers typically execute at a higher speed than block ciphers and have lower hardware requirements. However, stream ciphers can be susceptible to serious security problems if used incorrectly; for example, in particular, the same starting state must never be used twice.

A stream cipher makes use of a much smaller and more convenient cryptographic keys, for example 128 bits keys. Based on this key, it generates a pseudorandom keystream which can be combined with the plaintext digits in a similar way to the one-time pad encryption algorithm. However, because the keystream is pseudorandom, and not truly random, the security associated with the one-time pad cannot be applied and it is quite possible for a stream cipher to be completely insecure.

A stream cipher generates successive elements of the keystream based on an internal state. This state is updated in two ways: 

In a synchronous stream cipher a stream of pseudo-random digits is generated independently of the plaintext and ciphertext messages, and then combined with the plaintext (to encrypt) or with the ciphertext (to decrypt). In the most common form, binary digits(bits) are used , and the keystream is combined with the plaintext using the exclusive or operation (XOR). This is termed a binary additive stream cipher.

In a synchronous stream cipher, the sender and receiver must be in synchronous for decryption to be successful. If digits are added or removed from the message during transmission, synchronisation is lost. To restore synchronisation, various offsets can be tried systematically to obtain the correct decryption. Another approach is to mark the ciphertext with markers at regular points in the output.

If, however, a digit is corrupted in transmission, rather than added or lost, only a single digit in the plaintext is affected and the error does not propagate to other parts of the message. This property is useful when the transmission error rate is high; however, it makes it less likely that the error would be detected without further mechanisms. Moreover, because of this property, synchronous stream ciphers are very susceptible to active attacks — if an attacker can change a digit in the ciphertext, he might be able to make predictable changes to the corresponding plaintext bit; for example, flipping a bit in the ciphertext causes the same bit to be flipped(Toggled) in the plaintext.

Self-synchronizing stream ciphers is another technique that uses part of the previous "N" ciphertext digits to compute the keystream. Such schemes are known also as asynchronous stream ciphers or ciphertext autokey (CTAK). The idea of self-synchronization was patented in 1946, and has the advantage that the receiver will automatically synchronise with the keystream generator after receiving "N" ciphertext digits, making it easier to recover if digits are dropped or added to the message stream. Single-digit errors are limited in their effect, affecting only up to "N" plaintext digits. It is somewhat more difficult to perform active attacks on self-synchronising stream ciphers rather than synchronous counterparts.

An example of a self-synchronising stream cipher is a block cipher in cipher-feedback mode (CFB).

Binary stream ciphers are often constructed using linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) because they can be easily implemented in hardware and can be quickly analysed mathematically. However, the use of LFSRs only is insufficient to provide good security. Various schemes have been designed to increase the security of LFSRs. 

Because LFSRs are inherently linear, one technique for removing the linearity is to feed the outputs of a group of parallel LFSRs into a non-linear Boolean function to form a "combination generator". Various properties of such a "combining function" are important for ensuring the security of the resultant scheme, for example, in order to avoid correlation attacks. 

Normally LFSRs are stepped regularly. One technique to introducting non-linearity is to have the LFSR clocked irregularly, controlled by the output of a second LFSR. Such generators include the stop-and-go generator, the alternating step generator and the shrinking generator.

The stop-and-go generator (Beth and Piper, 1984) consists of two LFSRs. One LFSR is clocked if the output of a second is a "1", otherwise it repeats its previous output. This output is then (in some versions) combined with the output of a third LFSR clocked at a regular rate.

The shrinking generator uses a different technique. Two LFSRs are used, both clocked regularly in the following way:

This technique suffers from timing attacks on the second generator, since the speed of the output is variable in a manner that depends on the second generator's state. This can be improved by buffering the output. 

Another approach to improving the security of an LFSR is to pass the entire state of a single LFSR into a non-linear "filtering function".

Instead of a linear driving device, one may use a nonlinear update function. For example, Klimov and Shamir proposed triangular functions (T-Functions) with a single cycle on n bit words.

To be secure, the period of the keystream (the number of digits output before the stream repeats itself) needs to be large enough. If the sequence repeats, then the overlapping ciphertexts can be aligned against each other ""in depth"", and there are techniques which allow extraction of the plaintext form ciphertexts generated using these methods. 

Stream ciphers are often used in applications where plaintext comes in quantities of unknowable length as in secure wireless connections. If a block cipher were to be used in this type of application, the designer would need to choose either transmission efficiency or implementation complexity, since block ciphers cannot directly work on blocks shorter than their block size. For example, if a 128-bit block cipher received separate 32-bit bursts of plaintext, three quarters of the transmitted data need padding. Block ciphers must be used in ciphertext stealing or residual block termination mode to avoid padding, while stream ciphers eliminate this issue by operating on the smallest transmitted unit (usually bytes).

Another advantage of stream ciphers in military cryptography is that the cipher stream can be generated by an encryption device that is subject to strict security measures then fed to other devices, e.g. a radio set, which will perform the xor operation as part of their function. The other device can be designed for used in less securely environments.

Thalwil

Thalwil is a municipality in the district of Horgen in the canton of Zürich in Switzerland.

Early Middle Ages Thalwil was Alemannic farmland. 

Thalwil was originally four "Wachten", or hamlets:

In the Middle Ages , most income was made in farming, vineyards and a small amount of fishing on the lake. 
Thalwil also has the oldest wood corporation in the Canton of Zurich, the "Bannegg-Waldung". It was first mentioned in 1483. 

Today, the economy of Thalwil is mostly some small and medium-sized businesses, and a wide range of shops. Most of the shops are located around Gotthardstrasse- the town centre.

The main source of Thalwil's wealth lies with its 7,000 commuters. These people live in Thalwil, but work in Zurich city. Today, Thalwil has left most of its farming past behind in exchange for a town of commuters, with its public transportation links, low tax and good quality of life.

Hearth

A hearth (har-th) is a brick or stone lined fireplace or oven that is used for cooking and heating. Historically, the hearth was the center of the home, as it provided heat for the house. Its Latin name is "focus" as it could be called the "focus" of the house.

In more modern times, the hearth can also be section of the fireplace that can be seen. This often includes tileing around the base of the fireplade onto the floor.

<doc id="137586" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137586" title="Lakes of Titan">
Lakes of Titan

The lakes of Titan, a moon of Saturn, are made of liquid methane. The lakes were found by the "Cassini-Huygens" space probe. The larger lakes are known as maria (seas) and the smaller ones as lacūs (lakes).

It was possible that there were seas of liquid methane on Titan and first suggested after reading Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 information that showed Titan to have a thick atmosphere, capable of supporting lakes, but exact evidence wasn't found until 1995 when pictures from the Hubble telescope and other telescopes had already shown some proof of liquid methane, possibly in lakes or planet-wide oceans, similar to oceans on Earth.

The "Cassini" mission proved there are liquid lakes on Titan, but not at first. When the probe arrived in the Saturnian system in 2004, scientists hoped that hydrocarbon lakes or oceans might be seen in reflected sunlight from the surface, but no reflections were found. 

Scientists still believed that liquid ethane and methane would be found near Titan's poles, where they expected to find lots of liquid. At Titan's south pole, an large dark area named Ontario Lacus was the first lake identified, possibly created by rain as clouds are often seen in the area. A possible shoreline was also identified at the pole in radar images. As the Huygens-Cassini probe flew by on July 22, 2006, its radar took pictures of the northern part of the planet (which was in its winter), a number of large, smooth areas were found on the surface near the northern pole. Based on this data, scientists announced "definitive evidence of lakes filled with methane on Saturn's moon Titan" in January 2007. The "Cassini–Huygens" team decided that the smooth areas are the hydrocarbon lakes they had been searching for, the first lakes found off Earth. Some valleys appear to have rivers.

The satellite was not able to show pictures of lakes moving in the wind. The heavy moisture and clouds of methane near Titan’s surface could be a sign of evaporation from lakes. The lakes cover 0.002–0.02% of the saturns surface.
The "Cassini-Huygens" probe flew by in February, 2007, taking radar and camera pictures of some large areas near the north pole that may be large areas of liquid methane and/or ethane, including one sea larger than 100,000 km² (larger than Lake Superior), and another area similar in size to the Caspian Sea. Pictures taken near Titan's southern pole in October 2007 showed similar, but far smaller, areas that look like lakes.
The Cassini-Huygens probe, flew very close to Titan in December 2007, and took infrared pictures of the chemicals on the surface and found a lake called Ontario Lacus near the south pole. Scientists studying the infrared pictures decided that one or more of the large lakes in the pictures of Saturn's moon Titan does hold liquid and that the liquid is made of hydrocarbons. They have also found ethane on Titan. This mission proves Titan to be the only other planet known to have liquid on its surface. The lakes make Titan a very important planet for studying weather science. Liquids, gases and temperatures are at play on Titan. This should help the science of weather forecasting. 

Lakes were not found near near Titan's center of Titan which was studied on January 14 2005. A part of the Huygens-Cassini probe landed there. The pictures taken by the probe as it fell showed no open areas of liquid, but showed rivers that had dried. It was at first thought that dark areas near the center of Titan could be a lake of a liquid or tar-like substance, but the probe landed on the dark area, and it is solid without any liquid. A device known as a penetrometer studied the surface as the probe landed and seemed to find wet clay. Scientists believe that the penetrometer may have landed on a large pebble, and they say that the surface is similar to sand made of ice. Pictures taken after the probe landed show a large flat area covered in pebbles. The pebbles may be made of water ice and are partly rounded, which indicates fluids.

On February 13, 2008, scientists said that Titans polar lakes contain "hundreds of times more natural gas and other hydrocarbons than all the known natural gas on Earth." The desert near the center of the planet are not liquid but do have more organics than Earth.. In June 2008, "Cassini"'s Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer confirmed the presence of liquid ethane beyond doubt in a lake in Titan's southern hemisphere.

Predictions of Titan's clouds are that during in a Saturnian year, liquid moves from the equator to the poles, in clouds, and falls as rain.

Titanian "maria" (large hydrocarbon seas) are named after sea monsters of Earth.

Areas named "Lacus" are believed to be methane lakes. They are named after lakes on Earth.

West Coast blues

The West Coast blues is a type of blues music related to jazz and jump blues, with lots of piano sounds and jazz guitar solos, which originated from Texas blues musicians that moved to California in the 1940s. West Coast blues also uses smooth, honey-toned vocals, often sounding similar to urban blues.
Texas and the West Coast

The best known West Coast blues musicians may be guitarist T-Bone Walker, famous for the song "Call It Stormy Monday (But Tuesday Is Just As Bad)", originally from Texas, he had made his first recordings in the late 1920s. During the early 1940's Walker moved to Los Angeles, where he recorded a lot of music for Capital, Black & White, and Imperial. Walker an electric guitar sound to the blues, prossibly doing more to make the use of electric guitar popular in blues than anyone else. Much of his material had a jazzy jump blues feel, which is typical of popular blues from California in the 1940s and 1950s. Other Texas bluesmen followed: Pianist/songwriter Amos Milburn, singer Percy Mayfield, famous for the song "Hit the Road Jack", and Charles Brown moved to Los Angeles. Guitarist Pee Wee Crayton divided his time between Los Angeles and San Francisco, while Lowell Fulson, from Texas by way of Oklahoma, moved to Oakland.
After the efforts of Tom Mazzolini, producer of the San Francisco Blues Festival, started in 1974, and the efforts of recording companies like Arhoolie and HighTone, the West Coast is one of the most important blues areas in the country.

Frederick Pottinger

Sir Frederick William Pottinger, 2nd Baronet (1831–1865), police inspector, was born on April 27, 1831, in India. He became famous for leading the New South Wales police in their hunt for the bushrangers Ben Hall, John Gilbert, Frank Gardiner and John Dunn.

He was the son of Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Pottinger of the British East India Company, and his wife Susanna Maria, née Cooke, of Dublin. Henry Pottinger was the first Governor of Hong Kong. Frederick went to Eton from 1844 to 1847. Between 1850 and 1854, Pottinger was an officer in the Grenadier Guards in England. He lost a lot of his mother's money gambling on horse races. In 1856 he took the place of his father as second baronet. He soon gambled away all his money. He owed people a lot of money.

He went to Australia to search for gold. He joined the New South Wales police force as a mounted trooper. He was an excellent horse rider and spent the next few years working on the gold escort between Gundagai and Goulburn.

Pottinger kept his title secret but in 1860 the inspector-general of police, John McLerie, found out. He was quickly given better jobs. In November he became clerk of petty sessions at Dubbo and on October 1, 1861, assistant superintendent of the Southern Mounted Police Patrol. He wanted to do a good job in the police, but he got into a drunken brawl at Young on 20–21 December 1861. He was a publicly warned about his bad behaviour. He was sent to the Lachlan River area. He showed he was a busy but unlucky hunter of bushrangers.

In 1862 Pottinger was made an inspector of police for the Western District of New South Wales. In April 1862 he arrested Ben Hall at Forbes on a charge of robbery. Hall he was released because there was not enough evidence to prove he was a robber. Soon afterward Hall joined Frank Gardiner's gang. On June 15, 1862, they robbed the Lachlan gold escort of some £14,000 at Eugowra. This was Australia's biggest gold robbery. Pottinger was able to capture two of the bushrangers quickly. They escaped several days later in a gun battle. Pottinger got back some of the stolen gold.

People thought Pottinger made a lot of mistakes. He was in trouble for not having enough police guards on the gold escort and letting his prisoners escape. On the night of August 9, Pottinger and a group of police surrounded the house of Gardiner's mistress, Kate Brown. The bushranger escaped when Pottinger's pistol fired accidentally. They arrested a young boy who they thought was a friend of the bushrangers. When he died from a fever in gaol in March 1863, this was seen to be caused by Pottinger's cruelty. In February 1862 Pottinger was in court at Yass for assault. During a game of billiards he had been called a cheat, a liar and a scoundrel. He hit the person with the billiard cue and smashed his head through a window. On September 27, 1862, Pottinger had appeared before a Bathurst court on a charge of assault. In February 1863 Pottinger went to Sydney for the trial of the escort robbers. He was pushed in the street by people in the crowd. He also threatened a Member of Parliament, J. J. Harpur, with his whip. He didn't like things that Harpur had said about him.

The bushrangers in his area became more active. He captured Patrick Daley. On August 17, 1864, he nearly caught James Alpin McPherson.

In May 1863 the inspector-general told police to think of new ways to catch the bushrangers. Early in January 1865 Pottinger rode a horse in the Wowingragong races. This was against the rules of the police force. He was sacked (lost his job) on February 16, 1865. Pottinger said that he was just trying to get Ben Hall and John Dunn to come out of hiding. His plan worked and the bushrangers went to the races, only Pottinger didn't see them. Protest meetings against his sacking were held on the gold diggings and in the towns. People signed petitions for him to get his job back. He was regarded as a brave and tireless policeman. Pottinger went to Sydney to try and get back his job. On March 5, 1865, at Wascoe's Inn in the Blue Mountains Pottinger accidentally shot himself in the stomach while trying to get onto a moving coach. He was moved to the Victoria Club in Sydney where he died on April 9, 1865. His brother Henry became the 3rd Baronet. He was buried at St Jude's Anglican Church, Randwick.

Bushfire

A bushfire is a wildfire that happens in the Australian bush. Bush is the word for scrub, woodland or grassland of Australia and New Zealand. In south east and south west of Australia, bushfires are most common in the summer and early autumn. In the north of Australia, bushfires usually happen during winter which is the dry season.. Many Australian plants burn easily. Eucalyptus trees have a high oil content which makes them burn. Over the last 40 years, Australian bushfires have cost A$2.5 billion. In the same period, Australian bushfires caused the death of around 250 people and the destruction of 4,554 homes. And these figures do not include the 173 people who died and the 2000 homes destroyed in the 2009 Victorian bushfires. They can also kill wildlife including rare koala.

<doc id="137607" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137607" title="Artificial selection">
Artificial selection

Artificial selection is the intentional breeding of plants or animals. It means the same thing as selective breeding. 

Selective breeding is a technique used when breeding domesticated animals, such as dogs, pigeons or cattle. Some of these animals will have traits that a breeder will want to preserve. The breeder will therefore select those animals to breed that have such a quality, rather than those that do not.

Selective breeding often leads to inbreeding, and loss of fertility. To control this, most breeds are outcrossed or backcrossed to wild-type individuals, or at least less inbred stock. This is done every so many generations: the details differ from breed to breed.

Charles Darwin used the example of artificial selection to introduce his idea of natural selection. Artificial selection may be contrasted with the process of natural selection. In natural selection, the differential reproduction of organisms with certain traits happens. This is because some variations help the organism to have better survival and reproduction. The process maintains or enhances the fitness of a population in its natural habitat. 

Artificial selection may sometimes be unintentional; it is thought that domestication of crops by early humans was largely unintentional.

Inbreeding is a particular kind of selective breeding, designed to produce a population which is genetically virtually identical. Such populations are rarely viable outside the laboratory.

Selectable marker

A selectable marker is a reporter gene introduced into a cell along with a gene insert. What this means is, the experimenter can tell the right gene is in the cell because the marker can be seen or detected.

Most often, this is used for bacteria or for cells in culture. Selectable markers show the success of a transfection or other procedure meant to introduce foreign DNA into a cell. 

Selectable markers are often antibiotic resistance genes; bacteria that have been subjected to a procedure to introduce foreign DNA are grown on a medium containing an antibiotic. The antibiotic knocks out cells which do not have the resistant marker. Those bacterial colonies that can grow have successfully taken up and expressed the introduced genetic material.

An alternative to a selectable marker is a screenable marker, which allows the researcher to distinguish between wanted and unwanted cells.

Examples of selectable markers include:

Evolutionary algorithm

In Computer Science, especially in artificial intelligence, evolutionary algorithms are a kind of algorithm that simulate evolution to optimise something. Each generation of solution is subjected to some kind of fitness function; those that "survive" are then recombined in some way to make the next generation of solution. This is done until a certain level of fitness is reached, or a determined number of generations have been used.

Artificial life (commonly Alife or alife) is a field of study which examines systems related to life, its processes, and its evolution. This is done with simulations using computer models, robotics, and biochemistry. There are three main kinds of alife, named for their approaches: "soft", from software; "hard", from hardware; and "wet", from biochemistry. Artificial life imitates traditional biology by trying to "recreate" biological phenomena. The term "artificial life" is often used to specifically refer to soft alife.

<doc id="137614" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137614" title="Genetic algorithm">
Genetic algorithm

Genetic algorithms are a kind of algorithm used to find approximations in search problems. Genetic algorithms are a class of evolutionary algorithms that use ideas inspired by evolution to find a solution.

The concept of genetic algorithms is a search technique often used in computer science to find complex, non-obvious solutions to algorithmic optimisation and search problems. Genetic algorithms are categorised as global search heuristics , and have a wide variety of applications, particularly in generating useful Artificial Intelligence agents in computer games.

For decades, games and the field of game theory have provided competitive, dynamic, often unpredictable environments that make ideal test beds for computational intelligence theories, architectures, and
algorithms. Natural evolution can be modelled as a game, in which the rewards for an organism that plays a good game of life are the propagation of its genetic material to its successors and its continued survival . In natural evolution, the performance of an individual is defined with respect to its competitors and collaborators, as well as to the environment. More simply described, genetic algorithms are a simulation in which a population of abstract representations (called chromosomes or the genotype of the genome, after their biological counterparts) of candidate solutions (called individuals, creatures, or phenotypes) to an optimisation problem.

Candidates are evaluated and crossbred in an attempt to generate high quality solutions which would be non obvious and extremely time consuming to a human programmer. An evolutionary phase is initialised with a population of randomly generated entities (or human specified instances of high quality). The process is subdivided into different generations. In each generation, the fitness of every individual
in the population is evaluated, and multiple individuals are stochastically selected from the current population (based on their fitness), and modified (recombined and possibly
randomly mutated) to form a new population. The new population is then used in the next iteration of the algorithm. The algorithm terminates when either a maximum number of generations has been produced, or a satisfactory fitness level has been reached for the population. If the algorithm has terminated due to a maximum number of generations, a satisfactory will not necessarily have been obtained.

Genetic algorithms have been successfully used in many fields of computer science, including but not limited to the optimisation of complex algorithms, the training of text classification systems, and the evolution of intelligent artificial agents in stochastic environments.

Board games are a very relevant part of the area of genetic algorithms as applied to game theory problems. Much of the early work on computational intelligence and games was directed toward classic board games, such as tic-tac-toe , chess, and checkers . Board games can now, in most cases, be played by a computer at a higher level than the best humans, even with blind exhaustive
search techniques. Go is a noted exception to this tendency, and has so far resisted machine attack. The best Go computer players now play at the level of a good novice . Go strategy is said to rely heavily on pattern recognition, and not just logical analysis as with chess and other more piece-independent games. The huge effective branching factor required for finding high quality solutions heavily restricts the look-ahead that can be used within a move sequence search.

The genetic algorithm can be utilised in computer games - for example, to allow an enemy opponent to adapt in order to cater against an effective but repetitive tactic exhibited by a human player. This allows for a more realistic game experience; if a human player can find a sequence of steps which, repeated in different games always lead to success, there can be no challenge left. Conversely if a learning technique such as a genetic algorithm for a strategist can avoid repeating past mistakes, the game will have increased playability.

Genetic algorithms require the following components:


The fitness function accepts a mutated instantiation of an entity and measures its quality. This function is customised to the problem domain. In many cases, particularly those involving code optimisation, the fitness function may simply be a system timing function. Once a genetic representation and fitness function are defined, a genetic algorithm will instantiate initial candidates as described previously, and then improve through repetitive application of mutation, crossover, inversion and selection operators (as defined according to the problem domain).

The concept of having a full or partial view of the game changes the approach required significantly. An important point to note is that despite a computer obviously having a full view of the game state, making this fully available to the decision making process of an artificial player is going to make them behave unrealistically. Human-centered games are limited by what can easily be manipulated given human mental capacity and dexterity. Video games, on the other hand, operate under no such constraints and typically have a vastly more complex (internal) state space than even the most complex of human-centered games. This richer complexity encourages the development or evolution of more general purpose AI agents than are necessary for playing board or card games with sufficiently simulated skill levels. Currently, most computer controlled players in games implemented using manual scripting, which is quite tedious and time consuming to develop and test. The use of computational intelligence techniques offers an interesting alternative
to scripted approaches, whereby the agent behavior can be controlled using an evolved neural network, for example, rather than being programmed. Since such a neural approach may result in unique, novel behaviour impossible to achieve with manual implementation, the resulting quality of the product could be far higher. Such approaches often result in significantly more original results for every different player, the replayability of the game is extended. Furthermore, evolved AI players tend to be excellent at exploiting loopholes in a game. Identifying and eliminating these elements (which are seen as problems by the players/developers) can be achieved by genetic algorithms. In addition to this, through the life of a game, human players will also discover these, giving them an unfair advantage. If an AI player can also take advantage of these, the playing field is levelled. To have game characters that effectively exhibit such “human” characteristics improves the game, extends its lifetime, and increases total revenue. These techniques must be developed very carefully, especially in cases where agent difficulty is curved to compete fairly with the player. It has been an established technique in such games for a human player to intentionally play badly earlier on in the game, thus easing the difficulty; which in the end will decrease the quality and longevity of the game. Unfortunately, players tend to blame the developer for allowing
it to be possible.

Crème brûlée

Crème brûlée (or Crème brulée) (French for "burnt cream"; in English, in French) is a dessert made of custard and topped with a layer of hard caramel. Although often served cold in North America, traditionally it is to be served warm. The custard is baked and then sprinkled with sugar that is caramelized under a broiler or with a hot iron called a 'salamander'.

The custard base is normally flavoured with vanilla, but it can be flavoured with chocolate, liqueur, fruit, or other. Sometimes the hardened sugar on top will be covered in liqueur and set on fire.
Various countries claim to have invented the Crème brûlée, including the French, Spanish, and British. In England, it is claimed by some that the food was invented in Trinity College, Cambridge University.

Ancient Roman cooks were the first known to mix and beat eggs. They were experts at making several egg-based dishes, such as omelets. These foods were either savory or sweet (flavored with honey, nuts, cinnamon etc.).

Food historians think that custard came from the Middle Ages. At that time custard was eaten alone or used as fillings for pies, tarts, pastry, and more. However, custard was not special in Europe.

Crème brulee is a classic dish of smooth custard with a caramelized sugar topping. The origin of crème brulee is argued over a lot.

The Spanish also have a similar dessert they called "crema catalana" and claim to have invented it in the 18th century. It was not until the 19th century that the French translation of "burnt cream" or crème brulee came into popular culture, causing many to believe that the dessert is actually from French in origin.

The popularity of crème brulee in today's food culture is proved by the sale of prepared mixes and kitchen torches for use in the home. There are many kinds of recipes and flavors of the dessert, such as Asian, Mexican, and others.

Keystream

In cryptography, a keystream is a stream of random or pseudorandom characters that are combined with a plaintext message to produce an encrypted message (the ciphertext).

The "characters" in the keystream can be bits, bytes, numbers or actual characters like A-Z depending on the usage case.

Usually each character in the keystream is either added, subtracted or XORed with a character in the plaintext to produce the ciphertext, using modular arithmetic.

Keystreams are used in the one-time pad cipher and in most stream ciphers. Block ciphers can also be used to produce keystreams. For example, the CTR mode (also known as Integer Counter Mode (ICM)) is a block mode that makes a block cipher produce a keystream then turns the block cipher into a stream cipher.

In this simple example we will use only the English alphabet of 26 characters from a-z, therefore we will not encrypt numbers, commas, spaces and other symbols. As we have only 26 characters the random numbers in the keystream have to be at least between 0 and 25.

To encrypt we add the keystream numbers to the plaintext. And to decrypt we subtract the same keystream numbers from the ciphertext to get the plaintext.

If a ciphertext number becomes larger than 25 we wrap it to a value between 0-25. I.e. 26 becomes 0 and 27 becomes 1 and so on. (Such wrapping is called modular arithmetic.)

Here the plaintext message "attack at dawn" is combined by addition with the keystream "kjcngmlhylyu" and produces the ciphertext "kcvniwlabluh".

On December 10, 1971, the first feeler for surrender in East Pakistan was conveyed to the United Nations. On December 17, 1971, a formal surrender was submitted and accepted. Forty five thousand troops and an almost equal number of civilians of West Pakistan were taken as prisoners of war. 

The text of the Instrument of Surrender document was as follows: 

"INSTRUMENT OF SURRENDER" 

The PAKISTAN Eastern Command agree to surrender all PAKISTAN Armed Forces in BANGLA DESH to Lieutenant-General JAGJIT SINGH AURORA, General Officer Commanding in Chief of the Indian and BANGLA DESH forces in the Eastern Theatre. This surrender includes all PAKISTAN land, air and naval forces as also all para-military forces and civil armed forces. These forces will lay down their arms and surrender at the places where they are currently located to the nearest regular troops under the command of Lieutenant- General JAGJIT SINGH AURORA. 

The PAKISTAN Eastern Command shall come under the orders of Lieutenant-General JAGJIT SINGH AURORA as soon as this instrument has been signed. Disobedience of orders will be regarded as a breach of the surrender terms and will be dealt with in accordance with the accepted laws and usages of war. The decision of Lieutenant-General JAGJIT SINGH AURORA will be final, should any doubt arise as to the meaning or interpretation of the surrender terms. 

Lieutenant- General JAGJIT SINGH AURORA gives a solemn assurance that personnel who surrender will be treated with dignity and respect that soldiers are entitled to in accordance with the provisions of the GENEVA Convention and guarantees the safety and well-being of all PAKISTAN military and para-military forces who surrender. Protection will be provided to foreign nationals, ethnic minorities and personnel of WEST PAKISTAN origin by the forces under the command of Lieutenant- General JAGJIT SINGH AURORA. 

Signed: 

(JAGJIT SINGH AURORA) Lieutenant-General General Officer Commanding in Chief Indian and BANGLA DESH Forces in the Eastern Theatre 

(AMIR ABDULLAH KHAN NIAZI) Lieutenant-General Martial Law Administrator Zone B and Commander Eastern Command (PAKISTAN)

The surrender led to the disintegration of East and West Pakistan and the establishment of Bangladesh. After 25 years, the East Pakistanis declared themselves independent and renamed their Province as Bangladesh. Pakistan finally recognized Bangladesh at the Islamic Conference in Lahore on February 22, 1974 and fully restored diplomatic relations with the PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH on January 18, 1976.

Product cipher

In cryptography, a product cipher is a popular type of block ciphers that works by executing in sequence a number of simple transformations such as substitution, permutation, and modular arithmetic. 

Product ciphers usually consist of iterations of several "rounds" of the same algorithm. While individual "rounds" are not themselves secure, it is hoped that a sufficiently long chain of "rounds" would load the cipher with sufficient confusion and diffusion properties as to make it resistant to cryptanalysis. 

A product cipher that uses only substitutions and permutations is called a SP-network. Feistel ciphers are another important class of product ciphers.

Key schedule

In cryptography, the so-called product ciphers are a certain kind of ciphers, where the decryption of data is done in ""rounds"". The general setup of each "round" is the same, except for some hard-coded parameters and a part of the cipher key, called a subkey. A key schedule is an algorithm that, given the key, calculates the subkeys for these "rounds". 




Knudsen and Mathiassen (2004) give some experimental evidence that indicate that the key schedule plays a part in providing strength against linear and differential cryptanalysis. For toy Feistel ciphers, it was observed that those with complex and well-designed key schedules can reach a uniform distribution for the probabilities of differentials and linear hulls faster than those with poorly-designed key schedules.

Block size (cryptography)

In modern cryptography, symmetric key ciphers are generally divided into stream ciphers and block ciphers. Block ciphers operate on a fixed length string of bits. The length of this bit string is the block size. Both the input (plaintext) and output (ciphertext) are the same length; the output cannot be shorter than the input — this is logically required by the Pigeonhole principle and the fact that the cipher must be invertible — and it is simply undesirable for the output to be longer than the input.

The DES is using a block size of 64 bits (8 bytes) while the AES is using a block size of 128 bits (16 bytes). Rijndael, supports block sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits, although the extra block sizes were not adopted by the AES standard.

A few block ciphers, such as RC5, support a variable block size. The Luby-Rackoff construction and the Outerbridge construction can both increase the effective block size of a cipher. 

Few ciphers have unusual block sizes, for example the 3-Way block cipher have an unusual block size of 96 bits (12 bytes).

EFF DES cracker

In cryptography, the EFF DES cracker (nicknamed "Deep Crack") is a machine built by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) to perform a brute force search of DES cipher's key space — that is, to decrypt an encrypted message by trying every possible key. The aim in doing this was to prove that DES's key is not long enough to be secure.

The DES uses a 56-bit key, meaning that there are 2 possible keys under which a message can be encrypted. This is approximately 7.21 (more than 72 quadrillion). When DES was approved as a federal standard in 1976, a machine fast enough to test such amount of keys in a reasonable time would have cost an unreasonable amount of money to build.

Classified information

Classified information is sensitive information to which access is restricted by law or regulation to particular classes of people. A formal security clearance is required to handle classified documents or access classified data. The clearance process requires a satisfactory background investigation. There are typically several levels of sensitivity, with differing clearance requirements. This sort of hierarchical system of sharing information among a group of people is almost used by every national government. The operation of assigning the level of sensitivity to data is called data classification. 

The purpose of classification is to protect information from being used to damage or cause danger to national security. Classification formalizes what constitutes a "state secret" and deals with different levels of protection based on the expected damage the information might cause if it reached the wrong hands. 

Certain non-government organizations and corporations also have classified information, normally rather referred to as trade secrets.

Although the classification systems vary from country to country, most have levels corresponding to the following British definitions (from the highest level to lowest):

Depending on the level of classification there are different rules controlling the level of clearance needed to view such information, and how it must be stored, transmitted, and destroyed. Additionally, access is restricted on a "need to know" basis. Simply possessing a clearance does not automatically authorize the individual to view all material classified at that level or below that level. The individual must present a legitimate "need to know" in addition to the proper level of clearance.

The term "security clearance" is also sometimes used in private organizations that have a formal process of selecting employees to access ""sensitive information"". 

A clearance by itself is normally not sufficient to gain access; the organization must determine that the cleared person ""needs to know"" the information. No one is supposed to be granted access to classified information only because of rank, position, or a security clearance.

Sensitive information is information or knowledge that might result in loss of an advantage or level of security if exposed to others who might be unfriends or have low or unknown trustability.

Loss, misuse, modification or unauthorized access to sensitive information can negatively affect the privacy of an individual, trade secrets of a business or even the security, internal and foreign affairs of a nation depending on the level of sensitivity and nature of the information. 

The term classified information generally refers to information that is subject to special security classification regulations imposed by many national governments. The term "Unclassified" as used in the below refers to information that is not subject to security classification regulations. Information can be reclassified to a different level or declassified (made available to the public) depending on changes of situation or new intelligence.

Meet-in-the-middle attack

The Meet-in-the-middle attack is a cryptographic attack which, like the birthday attack, makes use of a space-time tradeoff. While the birthday attack attempts to find two values in the domain of a function that map to the same value in its range, the meet-in-the-middle attack attempts to find a value in each of the ranges and domains of the composition of two functions such that the forward mapping of one through the first function is the same as the inverse image of the other through the second function -- quite literally meeting in the middle of the composed function.

It was first developed as an attack on an attempted expansion of a block cipher by Diffie and Hellman in 1977. When trying to improve the security of a block cipher, one might get the idea to simply use two independent keys to encrypt the data twice and think that this would square the security of the double-encryption scheme. Certainly, an exhaustive search of all possible combination of keys would take formula_1 attempts if each key is n bits long, compared to the formula_2 attempts required for a single key. However, Diffie and Hellman, discovered a time-memory tradeoff that could break the scheme in only double the time to break the single-encryption scheme. The attack works by encrypting from one end and decrypting from the other end, thus meeting in the middle.

Assume the attacker knows a set of plaintext and ciphertext: "P" and "C". That is,
where E is the encryption function (cipher), and "K" and "K" are the two keys.

The attacker can then compute "E"("P") for all possible keys "K" and store the results in memory. Afterwards he can decrypt the ciphertext by computing "D"("C") for each "K". Any matches between these two resulting sets are likely to reveal the correct keys. (To speed up the comparison, the "E"("P") set is stored in an in-memory lookup table, then each "D"("C") can be matched against the values in the lookup table to find the candidate keys.)

Once the matches are discovered, they can be verified with a second test-set of plaintext and ciphertext. If the keysize is "n", this attack uses only formula_4 encryptions (and formula_5 space) in contrast to the naive attack, which needs formula_1 encryptions (but only formula_7 space).

MacGuffin (cipher)

In cryptography, MacGuffin is a block cipher created in 1994 by Bruce Schneier and Matt Blaze at a Fast Software Encryption workshop. It was intended as a catalyst for analysis of a new cipher structure, known as Generalized Unbalanced Feistel Networks (GUFNs). 

Schneier and Blaze based MacGuffin on DES, their main change was spliting the DES 64 bits data block into two unequal halves in the Feistel network, 48 bits of the 64-bit data block are fed through the round function, whose output is XORed with the other 16 bits of the data block. 

MacGuffin's key schedule is a modified version of the encryption algorithm itself. Since MacGuffin is a Feistel network, decryption is easy; simply run the encryption algorithm in reverse.

The algorithm was experimental, intended to explore the security properties of unbalanced Feistel networks. The cryptanalysis proceeded very quickly, so quickly that the cipher was broken using differential cryptanalysis at the same workshop by Vincent Rijmen and Bart Preneel. They also tried attacking MacGuffin with different S-boxes, taken directly from DES. This version was slightly stronger. 

Rijmen and Preneel warn that designing an algorithm to resist only known attacks is generally not a good design principle.

Schneier and Blaze recommended using 32 "rounds", and specified MacGuffin with a 128-bit key.

Feistel cipher

In cryptography, a Feistel cipher is a symmetric structure used in the construction of block ciphers, named after the German IBM cryptographer Horst Feistel; it is also commonly known as a Feistel network. A large set of block ciphers use the scheme, including the Data Encryption Standard (DES). 

The Feistel structure has the advantage that encryption and decryption operations are very similar, even identical in some cases, requiring only a reversal of the key schedule. Therefore the size of the code or circuitry required to implement such a cipher is nearly halved.

Feistel construction is iterative in nature which makes implementing the cryptosystem in hardware easier.

Feistel networks and similar constructions are product ciphers, and so combine multiple rounds of repeated operations, such as:
to produce a function with large amounts of what Claude Shannon described as "confusion and diffusion". 

Bit shuffling creates the diffusion effect, while substitution is used for confusion.

Many modern symmetric block ciphers uses Feistel networks, and the structure and properties of Feistel ciphers have been extensively explored by cryptographers. Specifically, Michael Luby and Charles Rackoff analyzed the Feistel block cipher construction, and proved that if the round function is a cryptographically secure pseudorandom function, with K used as the seed, then 3 rounds is sufficient to make the block cipher a pseudorandom permutation, while 4 rounds is sufficient to make it a "strong" pseudorandom permutation (which means that it remains pseudorandom even to an adversary who gets oracle access to its inverse permutation). Because of this very important result of Luby and Rackoff, Feistel ciphers are sometimes called Luby-Rackoff block ciphers. Further theoretical studies generalized the construction, and defined more precise limits for security.

Let formula_1 be the round function and let
formula_2 be the sub-keys for the rounds formula_3 respectively.

Then the basic operation is as follows:

Split the plaintext block into two equal pieces, (formula_4, formula_5)

For each round formula_6, compute (calculate)

Then the ciphertext is formula_9. (Commonly the two pieces formula_10 and formula_11 are not switched after the last round.)

Decryption of a ciphertext formula_9 is accomplished by computing for formula_13

Then formula_16 is the plaintext again.

One advantage of this model is that the round function formula_1 does not have to be "invertible", and can be very complex.

The diagram illustrates the encryption process. Decryption requires only reversing the order of the subkey formula_18 using the same process; this is the only difference between encryption and decryption:

Unbalanced Feistel ciphers use a modified structure where formula_4 and formula_5 are not of equal lengths. The MacGuffin cipher is an experimental example of such a cipher.
The Feistel construction is also used in cryptographic algorithms other than block ciphers. For example, the Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) scheme uses a simple Feistel network to randomize ciphertexts in certain asymmetric-key encryption schemes.

Islamic theology

Islamic theology deals with the beliefs associated with the Islamic faith.

Islamic theology is the theology that comes from the Qur'an, Hadith, and the story of Muhammad's life ("Sirah Rasul Allah"). 

Kalam is the Islamic philosophy of seeking theological principles through dialectic. In Arabic, the word literally means "speech". A scholar of kalam is referred to as a "mutakallim" (Muslim theologian; plural "mutakallimiin").

Eschatology is literally understood as the last things or ultimate things and in Muslim theology, eschatology refers to the end of this world and what will happen in the next world. Eschatology covers the death of human beings, their souls after their bodily death, the total destruction of this world, the resurrection of human souls, the final judgments of human deeds by Allah after the resurrection, and the rewards and punishments for the believers and non-believers. The places for the believers are known as Paradise and for the non-believers as Hell. 

Comparative religion in Muslim theology is about the differences and similarities between Muslim theology and other theologies such as Christian, Jewish theologies as explained in the Qur'an and the Prophetic traditions.

In the history of Muslim theology, there have been theological schools among Muslims with both similarities and differences with each other in regard to beliefs.

Sunni Muslims hold that there are six articles of belief: belief in Allah, in angels, in divinely revealed scripture] like Qur'an, in prophets, in the "Last Day" or end times, and in predestination.

Shi`ite Muslims hold that there are five articles of belief: the Divine Oneness and Justice, the Prophethood, the Imamate, and eschatology.

In terms of the relationship between human beings and their creator, Mu`tazilites emphasize human free will over predestination and God's justice over God's omnipotence. Mu'tazilites also believe in the use of logic to the true meanings of the Qur'an. This, combined with the principal of Ijtihad, led to their belief in dynamic Fiqh.

MacBook

A MacBook is a type of laptop computer made by Apple Inc. It runs Mac OS X and comes with a built in webcam and microphone and a power adapter that is attached by magnets. MacBooks are currently available housed in white plastic.

Many college students purchase MacBooks to help with their studies and to stay connected with their family and friends. MacBooks play most CDs and DVDs, even if they are copy protected.

The newest version of the MacBook came out on October 18, 2009. It now has the same "unibody" construction as the MacBook Pros.

The Macbook was introduced by Apple in May 2006. It replaced the iBook and 12 inch PowerBook series of notebooks because Apple was switching all of their CPUs to Intel from Power PCs.

Apple upgrades, or makes the MacBook better, about every six months, or half a year. This makes them faster and more reliable.

In October 2008, Apple decided to make a MacBook housed in aluminum. It was pretty much the same as the one housed in plastic except that it was a little better and that it was housed in metal. In June 2009, during WWDC (Apple's big yearly gathering), this laptop was renamed the MacBook Pro 13 inch.

SMS

An SMS, or short messaging service is a type of communication used in mobile phones. They are more commonly called 'text messages'. With SMS, someone can send text to another person.

SMS can be slow, as normal calls take priority over sending text messages on a network (which mean that they come first). There is also a limit of 160 characters that a text message can send. Longer messages than this will be sent as multiple messages, where the sender has to pay for each individual message. 

Text messages are often sent between phone users when an actual phone call is not wanted or needed. For example, they may be used in a situation where silence is needed, or to send something private that one person does not want people near them to hear. Message price depends on the phone network of the user. Some mobile phone plans allow for unlimited texting.

<doc id="137751" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137751" title="Alternative hip hop">
Alternative hip hop

Alternative hip hop is a form of hip hop music that is very different from gangsta rap, crunk, and snap. A way to explain it would be that if "regular hip hop" was on the middle of a number line, gangsta rap, crunk, and snap would be on one side, and alternative hip hop would be on the other. Even though it is a form of hip hop, fans of alternative hip hop tend to also be fans of alternative rock more than "regular hip hop" or especially pop.

Alternative hip hop originally came from the United States, and some artists like Gorillaz sprang up from the United Kingdom. Examples of American alternative hip hop artists are Talib Kweli, Mos Def, (and the band they started together, Black Star), Common, Nas, Kanye West, A Tribe Called Quest, Jurassic 5, and Styles of Beyond. It started as a movement-of-sorts from hip hop artists against the "tasteless" hip hop that was popular in the 1990s.

A nuclear equation or reaction equation is commonly used in particle physics to show radioactive decay processes. It is similar in function to chemical equations used in chemistry. It has a nuclide on the left then a right-pointing arrow and then the products of the decay on the right. The equation must be balanced follow the conservation laws of quantum mechanics for nuclear transformations. Certain things are not changed by decay. Thses are called "conserved entities". The conserved entities are total energy (including mass), number of nucleons, linear and angular momentum, and lepton number. The particles or nuclei in the equation are written with a superscript to show mass number 'A' and a subscript to denote atomic number 'Z.'

Thomas Paine (29 January 1737–8 June 1809) was an English pamphleteer, revolutionary, radical, inventor, and intellectual. He lived and worked in Britain until he was 37, when he emigrated to the British American colonies during American Revolution. His main contribution was the powerful, widely-read pamphlet "Common Sense" (1776). It promoted the idea of colonial America's independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain. He also wrote the "The American Crisis" (1776–1783), a pro-revolutionary pamphlet series. Thomas Paine, after the American Revolution, wrote the Age of Reason. This pamphlet promoted using of reason when it came to religious claims and was critical of organized religion. Paine along with other American founders such as Thomas Jefferson and James Madison were supporters of reason when it comes to religion in lieu of revelation. Paine was part of the greater Age of Enlightenment movement that dated back to about the early 17th century.

Richard R. Schrock

Richard Royce Schrock (born on January 4, 1945) is an American Professor of Chemistry. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 2005 for his work on the metathesis reaction used in organic chemistry.

Professor Schrock was born in Berne, Indiana, and went to Mission Bay High School in San Diego, California. He was given a B.A. degree in 1967) from the University of California, Riverside and a Ph.D., in 1971, from Harvard University. At Harvard he was a student of J. A. Osborn. Between 1971 and 1972, he studied at the University of Cambridge with Lord Jack Lewis. In 1972, he began working for George Parshall in the Experimental Station of the E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company in Wilmington, Delaware. He joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1975 and became a professor in 1980.

Schrock now works as the Frederick G. Keyes Professor of Chemistry, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He has worked there since 1989. Schrock is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, National Academy of Sciences and was elected to the Board of Overseers of Harvard University in 2007.

In 2005 Professor Schrock received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, along with Robert H. Grubbs and Yves Chauvin, for his work on olefin metathesis, which is a method of organic synthesis. Schrock was the first scientist to make sense of 'black box' olefin metathesis. Olefin Metathesis is used when making petroleum and reduces the amount of dirty waste.

Professor Schrock's work is continuing with metathesis as well as projects such as dinitrogen fixation and single molecule catalysts which make ammonia from dinitrogen, similar to nitrogenase enzymes in biology.

Schrock carbenes are named after Schrock.

All your base are belong to us

"All your base are belong to us" (often shortened to "All Your Base", "AYBABTU", or simply "AYB") is a broken English phrase that began an internet phenomenon in 2001 and 2002, with the use of a Flash animation. The phrase is taken from the first part of a European Sega Mega Drive version of the video game "Zero Wing", made in Japan by Toaplan. The words in the game were translated into English so quickly that they did not make very much sense. The words "All your base are belong to us" were at first popular on the Something Awful message forums.

In the Japanese text, "CATS" seems to be the name of an organization, not just of the character on the screen.

The phrase and similar phrases from the game has been shown in articles, books, comics, clothing, movies, radio shows, songs, television shows, video games, webcomics, and websites.

<doc id="137908" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137908" title="Mandaeism">
Mandaeism

Mandaeism or Mandaeanism (Mandaic: Mandaiuta, "Mandā'iyya") is a monotheistic religion. The religion has a strong dualistic world view. Its followers, the Mandaeans, think highly of Adam, Abel, Seth, Enosh, Noah, Shem, Aram and especially John the Baptist.

Originally, Mandaeism was practiced mainly in the countries around the lower Euphrates and Tigris and the rivers that surround the Shatt-al-Arab waterway. Today, this area belongs to Iraq and Khuzestan Province in Iran. Because they were persecuted in that area, many Mandaeans have left that area and now live abroad. This is commnoly called diaspora. Most left for Europe, Australia and North America.

There are thought to be between 60,000 and 70,000 Mandaeans worldwide, and until the 2003 Iraq war, almost all of them lived in Iraq. The 2003 Iraq War reduced the population of Iraqi Mandaeans to approximately 5,000 by 2007. Most Iraqi Mandaeans fled to Syria and Jordan under the threat of violence by Islamic extremists and the turmoil of the war.

The Mandaeans have remained separate and intensely private—what has been reported of them and their religion has come primarily from outsiders, particularly from the Orientalists J. Heinrich Petermann, Nicholas Siouffi, and Lady Ethel Drower.

Mandeism is the religion of the Mandaean people. It is based on a common history and heritage. There is no fixed set of religious creeds and doctrines. A basic guide to Mandaean theology does not exist. The corpus of Mandaean literature is quite large. It also covers topics such as eschatology, the knowledge of God, and the afterlife. It only does this in an unsystematic manner. Apart from the priests, very few people know it. 

According to E.S. Drower, the Mandaean Gnosis is characterized by nine features, which also appear in various forms in other gnostic sects:

Mandaeans believe in marriage and procreation, and in the importance of leading an ethical and moral lifestyle in this world. They put a high priority on family life. Consequently, Mandaeans do not practice celibacy or asceticism. Mandaeans will, however, abstain from strong drink and red meat. They look forward to a future liberated from the influence of the Torah, which they consider to be evil in origin. While they agree with other gnostic sects that the world is a prison governed by the planetary archons, they do not view it as a cruel and inhospitable one.

The Mandaeans have many religious texts. The most important of them is the "Genzā Rabbā" or Ginza. The Ginza is a collection of history, theology, and prayers. The "Genzā Rabbā" is divided into two halves — the "Genzā Smālā" or "Left Ginza" and the "Genzā Yeminā" or "Right Ginza". 

Before the printing press was invented, people copied texts by hand. The people doing this were called scribes. Each person's handwriting is special in certain ways. This was the same with scribes. A scribe might join two letters in a certain way, or he might do the dots on those letters that have them in a special way. Jorunn J. Buckley looked at these special marks the copyists left in the Left Ginza. That way he was able to show that the copying of that text goes back to the to the late 2nd or early 3rd century AD. These special marks show that the Mandaeans existed during the late Arsacid period at the very latest. A legend called "Harrān Gāwetā" also strengthens this. According to this legend, the Mandaeans left Palestine after the destruction of Jerusalem in the 1st century AD and settled inside the Arsacid empire. Although the Ginza continued to evolve under the rule of the Sassanians and the Islamic empires, few textual traditions can lay claim to such extensive continuity.

Other important books include the "Qolastā", the "Canonical Prayerbook of the Mandaeans," which was translated by E.S. Drower. One of the most important works of Mandaean scripture is the "Draša d-Iahia" "the Book of John the Baptist". This book is accessible to both laymen and initiates. There are also many other religious texts such as ritual commentaries, which are generally only consulted by the members of the priesthood.

The language in which the Mandaean religious literature was originally written is known as Mandaic, and is a member of the Aramaic family of dialects. It is written in a cursive variant of the Parthian chancellory script. The majority of Mandaean lay people do not speak this language. Some members of the Mandaean community in Iran ( about 300-500 out of a total of ca. 5000 Iranian Mandaeans) continue to speak Neo-Mandaic, a modern version of this language.

Mandaeans have several prophets. Iahia or Iuhana "John the Baptist" has a special status, higher than his role in Christianity and Islam. Mandaeans do not consider John to be the founder of their religion. They only worship him as one of their greatest teachers. They trace their beliefs back to Adam.

Mandaeans maintain that Jesus was a "mšiha kdaba" "false messiah" who changed the teachings given to him by John. The Mandaic word "k(a)daba", however, comes from two roots: the first root, meaning "to lie," is the one traditionally given to Jesus; the second, meaning "to write," might provide a second meaning, that of "book". Some Mandaeans, who are motivated perhaps by an ecumenical spirit, maintain that Jesus was not a "lying Messiah" but a "book Messiah". The "book" in question presumably being the Christian Gospels. This seems to be a folk etymology without support in the Mandaean texts.

Likewise, the Mandaeans believe that Abraham, Moses, and Muhammad were false prophets, but recognize other prophetic figures from the monotheistic traditions, such as Adam, his sons Hibil (Abel) and Šitil (Seth), and his grandson Anuš (Enosh), as well as Nuh (Noah), his son Sam (Shem) and his son Ram (Aram). The latter three they consider to be their direct ancestors.

There is a strict division between Mandaean laity and the priests. According to E.S. Drower ("The Secret Adam", p. ix):

There are three grades of priesthood in Mandaeism: the "tarmidia" "disciples" (Neo-Mandaic "tarmidānā"), the "ganzibria" "treasurers" (from Old Persian "ganza-bara" "id.", Neo-Mandaic ') and the "rišamma" "leader of the people." This last office, the highest level of the Mandaean priesthood, has lain vacant for many years. At the moment, the highest office currently occupied is that of the ', a title which appears first in a religious context in the Aramaic ritual texts from Persepolis (ca. 3rd c. BCE) and which may be related to the "kamnaskires" (Elamite <qa-ap-nu-iš-ki-ra> "kapnuskir" "treasurer"), title of the rulers of Elymais (modern Khuzestan) during the Hellenistic age. Traditionally, any ' who baptizes seven or more ' may qualify for the office of "rišamma", though the Mandaean community has yet to rally as a whole behind any single candidate.

The contemporary priesthood can trace its immediate origins to the first half of the 19 century. In 1831, an outbreak of cholera devastated the region and eliminated most if not all of the Mandaean religious authorities. Two of the surviving acolytes ("šgandia"), Yahia Bihram and Ram Zihrun, reestablished the priesthood on the basis of their own training and the texts that were available to them.

According to the "Fihrist" of ibn al-Nadim, Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, was brought up within the Elkasaites ("Elcesaites" or "Elchasaite") sect. The Elkasaites were a Christian baptismal sect which may have been related to the Mandaeans. The members of this sect wore white and performed baptisms like the Mandaeans. They lived in east Judea and northern Mesopotamia. According to the "Harran Gawaitā" legend, the Mandaeans migrated to southern Mesopotamia from there. Mani later left the Elkasaites to start his own religion. Mandaean scholar Säve-Söderberg showed that Mani's "Psalms of Thomas" were closely related to Mandaean texts. This would imply that Mani had access to Mandaean religious literature.

Other groups which have been identified with the Mandaeans include the "Nasoraeans", described by Epiphanius, and the Dositheans, mentioned by Theodore Bar Kōnī in his "Scholion". Ibn al-Nadim also mentions a group called the "Mughtasila", "the self-ablutionists," who may be identified with one or the other of these groups. The members of this sect, like the Mandaeans, wore white and performed baptisms.

It is difficult to say if groups such as the Elkasaites, the Mughtasila, the Nasoraeans, and the Dositheans are related to the Mandaeans or to one another.
The names say that there are a number of different groups. Much of the teaching of these groups is secret. This makes it difficult to see the nature of these groups or the relationships between them.

Under Saddam Hussein, the Mandeans were recognised as a religious minority. Many of them are craftspeople, like smiths or traders of gold and silver. These people belonged to the middle classes. Since the change of government in Iraq, islamic extremists have harassed them. There are also reports of attacks on women who refuse to veil themselves. Most Iraqi Mandaeans have fled as a result, and the Mandaean community in Iraq faces extinction.

In Iran, Mandeans do not have a problem with violence, but they are prohibited from fully participating in civil life because of "Gozinesh" Law. This law and other "gozinesh" provisions require a "religious screening" for people who want to access employment, education, and a range of other areas. A very important part of this screening procedure is devotion to the tenets of Islam. These laws are regularly applied to discriminate against religious and ethnic groups that are not officially recognized, such as the Mandaeans.

There were over 60,000 Mandaeans in Iraq in the early 1990s. In 2007, only about 5,000 to 7,000 remain there; over 80% of Iraqi Mandaeans were refugees in Syria and Jordan. This is a result of the Iraq War. There are small Mandaean populations in Australia (c. 3,500 as of 2006), Canada, the USA (c. 1,500), the UK (c. 1,000) and Sweden (c. 5,000).

The current status of the Mandaeans has prompted a number of American intellectuals and civil rights activists to call for their government to extend refugee status to the community. In 2007, the New York Times ran an op-ed in which Swarthmore professor Nathaniel Deutsch called for the Bush administration to take immediate action to preserve the community:

Substitution box

In cryptography, a S-Box ("Substitution-box") is a basic component of symmetric-key algorithms. In block ciphers, the S-Boxes are used to make the relation between the plaintext and the ciphertext difficult to understand—Shannon's property of confusion. The S-Boxes are carefully chosen to resist cryptanalysis.

In general, an S-Box takes some number of input bits, "m", and transforms them into some number of output bits, "n": an "m"×"n" S-Box can be implemented as a lookup table with 2 words of "n" bits each. Fixed tables are normally used, as in the Data Encryption Standard (DES), but in some ciphers the tables are generated dynamically from the key; e.g. the Blowfish and the Twofish encryption algorithms. Bruce Schneier describes IDEA's modular multiplication step as a key-dependent S-Box.

One good example is this 6×4-bit S-Box from DES (S):

Given a 6-bit input, the 4-bit output is found by selecting the row using the outer two bits, and the column using the inner four bits. For example, an input "011011" has outer bits "01" and inner bits "1101"; the corresponding output would be "1001".

The 8 S-Boxes of DES were the subject of intensive studies for many years cause of a concern that a method of bypassing the DES cipher to obtaining access to the plaintext—a "vulnerability" ("susceptibility") known only to its designers—might have been "planted" (inserted) in the cipher. In 1994, the S-Box design criteria were finally published by its designers after the public rediscovery of differential cryptanalysis, showing that they had been carefully tuned the design to increase resistance against differential cryptanalysis attacks. Other research had already indicated that even a very small modification to one of the 8 S-Box used by the DES could weaken it very much.

The design of good S-Boxes was the subject of a great amount of research; now much more is understood about their use in block ciphers than when the DES S-Boxes were released.

Confusion and diffusion

In cryptography, confusion and diffusion are two properties of the operation of a secure cipher.

Confusion and diffusion were identified by Claude Shannon in his paper, "Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems" published in 1949. In Shannon's original definitions:

Diffusion is associated with the dependency of the output bits on the input bits. In a cipher with good diffusion, flipping an input bit should change each output bit with a probability of one half (this is termed the Strict Avalanche Criterion). 

Substitution (a rule for replacing plaintext symbols by another) has been identified as a mechanism for primarily confusion (see S-box); on the other hand transposition using P-box) (rearranging or swapping the order of symbols) is a technique for diffusion, although other mechanisms are also used in modern practice, such as linear transformations (e.g. in AES). Product ciphers use alternating substitution and transposition phases (rounds) to achieve both confusion and diffusion respectively.

Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems is a paper published by Claude Shannon discussing cryptography from the viewpoint of information theory. It is one of the "foundational treatments" ("primitives") of modern cryptography. It is also a proof that all theoretically "unbreakable" ("un-crack-able") ciphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad encryption algorithm.

Shannon published an earlier version of this research in the classified report A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography, Memorandum MM 45-110-02, Sept. 1, 1945, Bell Laboratories.

In 1948, Shannon published his great paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" which is considered one of the founding works of the field of information theory.

Come as You Are

"Come as You Are" is a song by the American grunge band Nirvana. It was the second single from their second album, "Nevermind", the first was the enormously popular "Smells Like Teen Spirit". It is one of the band's most famous songs. "Rolling Stone" magazine named it as the 445th on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

There was a music video for the song. It has a lot of random scenes, such as Kurt Cobain sitting on a chandelier hanging from a ceiling, a handgun floating in a swimming pool, and a baby swimming in that pool (a reference to the cover art of "Nevermind".)

After the single was released, the English post-punk band Killing Joke became angry at Nirvana for supposedly ripping off their song "Eighties".

Nirvana thought that "Smells Like Teen Spirit", the previous single from "Nevermind", would not be very popular, and that "Come as You Are" would be a big hit. However, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" became the band's most famous song and one of the most famous songs ever, even though Come as You Are was also popular.

On November 18, 1993, Nirvana played "Come as You Are" on their show on MTV Unplugged. The show contained mostly their unpopular songs and covers of other artists' songs; "Come as You Are" was the only hit they played.

<doc id="137965" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137965" title="International Data Encryption Algorithm">
International Data Encryption Algorithm

In cryptography, the International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) is a block cipher designed by Xuejia Lai and James Massey of ETH Zurich in 1991. It was meant to be a replacement for the Data Encryption Standard. IDEA very like an earlier cipher called Proposed Encryption Standard (PES), but with some improvements. Because of this, IDEA was first called IPES (Improved PES).

The cipher is patented in a number of countries but can be used by anyone for non-commercial use. The name "IDEA" is also a trademark. The patents will expire in 2010–2011. Today, IDEA is licensed worldwide by a company called MediaCrypt.

IDEA was used in Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) v2.0 after the cipher used in v1.0, BassOmatic, was found to be breakable. IDEA can be used with the OpenPGP standard.

IDEA operates on 64-bit blocks, using a 128-bit key. It contains a series of eight identical transformations ("rounds") and one output transformation (the "half-round"). It does this for a total of 8.5 rounds. The processes for encryption and decryption are similar. 

IDEA derives much of its security by interleaving operations from different groups — modular addition and multiplication, and bitwise eXclusive OR (XOR) — which are chosen to be "algebraically incompatible".

Each of the eight round uses six sub-keys, while the half-round uses four; for a total of 52 sub-keys. Each sub-key is a 16-bit in length. The first eight sub-keys are extracted directly from the 128-bit key, with K1 being the lowest sixteen bits and K8 is the highest sixteen bits; further groups of eight keys are created by rotating the main key left 25 bits after the creation of the previous group; six rotations generate all sub-keys. 

The designers analyzed IDEA to measure its strength against differential cryptanalysis and concluded that it is unsusceptible only under certain assumptions. No successful linear or differential attacks have been reported. Some classes of weak keys have been found — E.g. (Daemen et al, 1994) — but these are of little importance, being so rare to be explicitly avoided. As of 2007, the best attack which applies to all keys can break IDEA if reduced to 6 rounds (the full IDEA cipher uses 8.5 rounds).

In 1996, Bruce Schneier wrote about IDEA, "In my opinion, it is the best and most secure block algorithm available to the public at this time." ("Applied Cryptography", 2nd ed.) However, by 1999 he was no longer recommending IDEA due to the availability of faster cryptographic algorithms, some progress in its cryptanalysis, and the issue of patents.

2008 Yemen floods

The 2008 Yemen floods took place on October 23, leaving 65 dead and 20,000 without shelter. The Yemeni governorates of Hadhramaut, Lahij, Al Mahrah and Ta'izz were affected the worst by the floods, and most of the deaths were in Hadhramaut.

Before the flooding was several days of rain starting on October 23, as the remains of a tropical cyclone moved over the area. Rain continued, with weather systems coming in from neighbouring Saudi Arabia and northern Somalia, causing severe flooding in some areas of Yemen. Better conditions are expected by Sunday.

Thousands of families fled Hadhramaut alone; many schools were used as evacuee shelters, but these could only hold 10% of the affected. Search and rescue teams said that the number of deaths may increase due to the likelihood of people trapped in flooded houses. Electricity and telephone lines were cut off, and many homes were damaged.

The Yemeni government promised to supply tents as a means of emergency shelter, along with other emergency supplies, with six transport aircraft loaded with supplies taking off from Sanaa on Saturday and more scheduled for later. President Ali Abdullah Saleh ordered the creation of a committee to provide aid to affected civilians. Also, the United Arab Emirates declared their intent to provide relief. However, several residents in the city of Shibam say that government assistance and support, if any, is low.

The Organisation of the Islamic Conference declared the situation a "national catastrophe" and started a drive on Saturday to collect funds for the relief of flood victims.

Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh said, "The damages... are great and the catastrophe is also great."

Along with deaths, about 730 homes were destroyed, along with businesses and other building projects. The severe thunder of the thunderstorms resulted in at least nine deaths from lightning in the Al Mahrah, Ta'izz and Lahij governorates. The rain also destroyed large amounts of farmland and killed large numbers of livestock.

Alexander Ramsey (September 8, 1815 April 22, 1903) was an American politician. He was born near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Ramsey was elected from Pennsylvania as a Whig to the U.S. House of Representatives and served in the 28th and 29th congresses from March 4, 1843 to March 3, 1847. He served as the first Territorial Governor of Minnesota June 1, 1849 to May 15, 1853 as a member of the Whig Party.
In 1855, he became the mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota. Ramsey was elected the second Governor of Minnesota after statehood and served from January 2, 1860 to July 10, 1863. Ramsey is credited with being the first Union governor to commit troops during the American Civil War (he happened to be in Washington, D.C. when fighting broke out). He resigned the governorship to become a U.S. Senator, having been elected to that post in 1863 as a Republican. He was re-elected in 1869 and held the office until March 3, 1875, serving in the 38th, 39th, 40th, 41st, 42nd, and 43rd congresses.

Ramsey served as Secretary of War from 1879 to 1881, under President Rutherford B. Hayes.

The Minnesota Historical Society preserves his home as a museum. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. Alexander Ramsey Park, located in Redwood Falls, Minnesota, is the largest municipal park in Minnesota. Ramsey County, Minnesota, Ramsey County, North Dakota, the city of Ramsey, Minnesota, the city of Ramsey, Illinois, Ramsey Park in Stillwater, Minnesota, and Alexander Ramsey Elementary School in Montevideo, Minnesota are also named for him.

Hurricane Dean

Hurricane Dean was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. It was also the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Wilma of 2005. Also, it made the third strongest Atlantic hurricane landfall. Dean moved west-northwest from the eastern Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lucia Channel and into the Caribbean Sea. It became into a very strong hurricane, reaching Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale before moving south of Jamaica on August 20. The storm moved onto land on the Yucatán Peninsula on August 21 as a Category 5 storm. It moved across the peninsula and entered the Bay of Campeche, as a weakened storm, but still a hurricane. It strengthened for a short time before making a second landfall in Veracruz near Tecolutla, Mexico, on August 22. Dean slowly moved to the northwest, weakening into a low pressure area which dissipated over the southwestern United States.

The hurricane's strong winds, waves, rains and storm surge caused over 45 deaths across ten countries and caused estimated damages of US$1.5 billion. First impacting the islands of the Lesser Antilles, Dean's path through the Caribbean severely damaged agricultural crops, especially those of Martinique and Jamaica. When it reached Mexico, Hurricane Dean was a Category 5 storm, but it missed large cities and its exceptional Category 5 strength landfall caused no deaths and less damage than in the Caribbean islands it passed as a Category 2 storm. Because of the damage, the name Dean was retired, and will not be used again for a tropical cyclone.

Ordered pair

In mathematics, an "ordered pair" is a collection of two objects, where one of the objects is first (the "first coordinate" or "left projection"), and the other is second (the "second coordinate" or "right projection"). An ordered pair where the first coordinate is formula_1 and the second coordinate is formula_2 is usually written formula_3 (sometimes it is written formula_4). If formula_1 is different from formula_2, then the ordered pair formula_3 is different from the ordered pair formula_8 - this is why it is called "ordered".

If formula_9 and formula_10 are two ordered pairs, then the "characteristic" or "defining" property of ordered pairs is:

This means that two ordered pairs are equal if and only if: the first coordinates of the pairs are equal, and also the second coordinates of the pairs are equal.

There are many mathematical definitions of "ordered pair" which have this property. The definition given here is the most common one:

Kazimierz Kuratowski was the first person to make this definition.

Arts and crafts is a term which is used to describe a wide variety of activities involving making things with one's own hands. Arts and crafts is usually a hobby. Some crafts (art skills) have been practised for centuries, others are more recent inventions.

Both children and adults enjoy arts and crafts. Children in schools may learn skills such as woodwork, carving, sewing, or making things with all sorts of other things. Many community centres and schools have evening or day classes and workshops where one can learn arts and craft skills.

Although "crafts" today are usually hobbies enjoyed by amateurs, the word was used many centuries ago by professional people who had a guild system. Young people were learned from a master-craftsman (i.e. they were "apprenticed"), and they often took many years to learn their skills to perfection.

Aga Khan III

Sir Sultan Muhammed Shah, Aga Khan III, GCSI, GCMG, GCIE, GCVO, PC (2 November 1877–11 July 1957) was the 48th Imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims. 

He became Imam at a very young age. He was seven years old when his father, Aga Khan II, died in 1885. He was one of the founders and the first president of the All-India Muslim League, and served as President of the League of Nations from 1937-38.

He was born in Karachi, in what was British India. He was given a religious education, and also a European education. He attended Eton and Cambridge University, and was a frequent visitor to Britain. 

His followers celebrated his anniversaries as Imam in 1937, 1946 and 1954 by weighing him in gold, diamonds and platinum. The proceeds were spent on welfare and development in Asia and Africa. Girls schools were set up in the remote northern areas of what is now Pakistan. He was knighted by Queen Victoria, and later made a member of the Privy Council.

At the end of his life, Sir Sultan Mohammed did a remarkable thing. In his will, he disinherited his son, Aly Khan, in favour of his grandson, Karim. So the next Khan, Aga Khan IV, was a younger man better suited to the modern world.

The Aga Khan married four times:

The Aga Khan's mausoleum is near the Nile at Aswan, Egypt.

William Sterndale Bennett

Sir William Sterndale Bennett (born Sheffield, 13 April 1816; died London, 1 February 1875) was a distinguished English composer of the Romantic period.

Bennett's father Robert Bennett, was organist of what is now Sheffield Cathedral. At the age of three he was an orphan, so he was brought up by his grandfather in Cambridge. At the age of seven he became a chorister at King's College Chapel Choir. In 1826 he entered the Royal Academy of Music, where he spent ten years studying. His piano teachers were W. H. Holmes, Dr William Crotch and later Cipriani Potter 

In 1833 he was made organist of St Anne's Church, Wandsworth and in that same year met Felix Mendelssohn who invited him to Germany. He went there four times, making long tours. He was welcomed and admired by famous musicians including Mendelssohn and Robert Schumann. Schumann later dedicated his "Symphonic Studies" to Bennett. He also often performed at the Leipzig Gewandhaus.

Although he knew the works of Bach and Mozart very well, many of his compositions were clearly influenced by Mendelssohn. As well as being known as one of Europe's most brilliant pianists, his music was well known for its new ideas, excitement and poetic beauty. His compositions include four overtures, six piano concertos, four symphonies, a chamber trio, sextet, several piano works and two song cycles to be followed later in life by a cello duo, a late Symphony in G minor, a Cantata The May Queen for the opening of Leeds Town Hall in 1858, and an oratorio The Woman of Samaria for the 1867 Birmingham Triennial Music Festival.
Of his 80 published compositions, nearly half are now available on CD, the most popular being the Overture "The Naiades Op 15", the "Chamber Trio Op 26" and the "Piano concerto No 4 in F minor Op 19".

From 1844 for fifteen years he organized the popular Chamber Music Concerts in the Queen's Concert Rooms, Hanover Square in London introducing a number of famous soloists to the British public. In 1848 he became a founding Director of Queen's College London and in the following year of Bedford College, now part of London University. In this way he helped women to get equal opportunity in education. 

In 1849 he formed the Bach Society (later to be reformed as the Bach Choir) in London to produce and conduct the first English performance of Bach's "St Matthew Passion" on 6 April 1854.

In 1856 he succeeded Wagner as conductor of the Philharmonic Society Orchestra. He was the first person to be given their Gold Medal. In 1866 he was chosen to be Professor of Music at Cambridge University having got an MA and Mus Doc. From 1866 until his death he was Principal of the Royal Academy of Music. A scholarship and Prize in his name continues to be awarded to this day. In 1870 Oxford University gave him an Hon DCL and a year later he was knighted. 

He died on 1st February 1875 and is buried in Westminster Abbey.

Several of his family later became well-known in music and theatre. Bennett left a large music library which is now at the Bodleian Library in collaboration with his great-great-grandson Barry Sterndale-Bennett (b 1939) which continues to be available for research purposes.

Space-time tradeoff

In computer science, a space-time or time-memory tradeoff is a way of solving a problem or calculation in less time by using more storage space (or memory), or by solving a problem in very little space by spending a long time. Most computers have a large amount of space, but not infinite space. Also, most people are willing to wait a little while for a big calculation, but not forever. So if your problem is taking a long time but not much memory, a space-time tradeoff would let you use more memory and solve the problem more quickly. Or, if it could be solved very quickly but requires more memory than you have, you can try to spend more time solving the problem in the limited memory.

The most common condition is an algorithm using a lookup table. This means that the answers for some question for every possible value can be written down. One way of solving this problem is to write down the entire lookup table, which will let you find answers very quickly, but will use a lot of space. Another way is to calculate the answers without writing down anything, which uses very little space, but might take a long time.

A space-time tradeoff can be used with the problem of data storage. If data is stored uncompressed, it takes more space but less time than if the data were stored compressed (since compressing the data decreases the amount of space it takes, but it takes time to run the compression algorithm). 

Larger code size can be used to increase program speed when using loop unwinding. This technique makes the program code longer for each iteration of a loop, but saves the computation time needed for jumping back to the beginning of the loop at the end of each iteration. 

In the field of cryptography, using space-time tradeoff, the attacker is decreasing the exponential time required for a brute force attack. Rainbow tables use partially precomputed values in the hash space of a cryptographic hash function to crack passwords in minutes instead of weeks. Decreasing the size of the rainbow table increases the time required to iterate over the hash space. The meet-in-the-middle attack attack uses a space-time tradeoff to find the cryptographic key in only formula_1 encryptions (and formula_2 space) compared to the expected formula_3 encryptions (but only formula_4 space) of the normal attack. 

Dynamic programming is another example where the time of solving problems can be decreased by using more memory.

Substitution-permutation network

In cryptography, an SP-network, or substitution-permutation network (SPN), is a series of linked mathematical operations used in block cipher algorithms such as AES.

These networks consist of S-boxes and P-boxes that transform blocks of input bits into output bits. 

S-boxes substitute or transform input bits into output bits. A good S-box will have the property that changing one input bit will change about half of the output bits. It will also have the property that each output bit will depend on every input bit. P-boxes permute or rearrange bits across S-box inputs. In addition, at each "round" the key is combined using some group operation, typically XOR.

Square (cipher)

In cryptography, Square (sometimes written S) is a block cipher invented by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. The design was published in 1997.

S is a predecessor to the Rijndael algorithm, which has been adopted in 2001 as the Advanced Encryption Standard by the U.S. government. 

Square was introduced together with a new form of cryptanalysis discovered by Lars Knudsen, called the "Square attack".

The structure of Square is a substitution-permutation network with eight rounds, operating on 128-bit block size and using a 128-bit key size.

Square is not patented.

Permutation box

In cryptography, a permutation box (or P-box) is a method of bit-shuffling used to permute or transpose bits (rearrange or swap the order of bits) across S-boxes inputs, maintaining diffusion while transposing.

In block ciphers, the S-boxes and P-Boxes are used to make the relation between the plaintext and the ciphertext difficult to understand (see Shannon's property of confusion).

Carnivorous plant

Carnvorous plants are plants which get nutrients from trapping and eating animals. They are often called insectivorous plants, because they usually trap insects. Since they get some of their food from animals, carnivorous plants can grow in places where the soil is thin, or poor in nutrients. This is true for soils with little nitrogen, such as acidic bogs and rock outcrops. Charles Darwin wrote the first well-known book on carnivorous plants in 1875.

This ability of plants to catch animals is called "true carnivory". There are more than twelve genera in five families. These include about 625 species that attract and trap prey, produce digestive enzymes, and use their nutrients. In addition, there are more than 300 species in several genera that show some but not all of these characteristics. These are usually called "protocarnivorous plants".

Insectivorous plants have leaves that are made like pitchers or bladders which catch insects. Today, five different ways of trapping are known

These traps are all classified as "active" or "passive". "Triphyophyllum" is a liana (a climber in tropical forests). It has three types of leaves. When needed, it puts out long leaves. These are passive 'flypapers' which hide mucus. The leaves of the plant do not grow or move as a response to moving prey. The Sundew "Drosera", on the other hand, is an active flypaper. All species of Sundew are able to move their sticky tentacles in response to a contact. The tentacles are very sensitive and will bend toward the center of the leaf in order to bring the insect into contact with as many stalked glands as possible. According to Darwin, the touch of legs of a small gnat with a single tentacle is enough to cause this response. This helps the catch and digestion of prey.

The Venus Flytrap, "Dionaea muscipula", is one of a very small group of plants able to move fast. When an insect or spider crawls along the leaves and touches a hair, the trap closes "only if a different hair is contacted within twenty seconds of the first touch". The two-touch trigger avoids wasting energy on objects with no food value.
A carnivorous plant must attract, kill and digest prey. It must then also benefit from digesting the prey. In most cases, this will yield amino acids and ammonium ions. There are some cases, where plants catch the prey, but they do not digest it. Rather, they have a symbiosis with another organism, which feeds on the prey. One such case is the species of the sundew "Roridula", which forms a symbiosis with the assassin bug. The bugs eat the trapped insects. The plant benefits from the nutrients in the bugs' faeces.

Few fossil carnivorous plants have been found, and then usually as seed or pollen. Carnivorous plants are generally herbs, without wood or bark. True carnivory has probably evolved independently at least six times. 

Some think all trap types have a similar basic structure—the hairy leaf. Hairy leaves do catch and hold drops of rainwater, which helps bacterial growth. Insects land on the leaf, are caught by the surface tension of the water, and suffocate. Bacteria start to decay the insect, and release nutrients from the corpse. The plant then absorbs the nutrients through its leaves. This 'leaf feeding' can be found in many non-carnivorous plants. Plants that were better at holding water and insects therefore had a selective advantage. Rainwater can be retained by cupping the leaf, leading to pitfall traps. Alternatively, insects can be caught by making the leaf stickier, leading to flypaper traps.

The Coat of arms of Azerbaijan mixes traditional and modern symbols. The focal point of the emblem is the fire symbol. This symbol comes from the fact that Azerbaijan has many everlasting fires which also gives the name "land of eternal fire".
The colors used in composing the emblem are taken from the national flag. These colors are found in the background behind the eight pointed star (۞ Rub El Hizb) upon which the flame is shown. The star itself stands for the eight branches[?] of the Turkic peoples , and between each point of the star, there is a smaller eight pointed star found. 

Like other post-Soviet republics whose arms do not predate the October Revolution, the current arms retains some components of the Soviet one. At the bottom of the emblem is a stalk of wheat, representing the main agricultural product of the nation, which was also part of the earlier arms. The other plant represented at the bottom is oak.

Lookup table

In computer science, a lookup table is a data structure, usually an array or associative array, used to replace a runtime computation (calculation) with a simple array indexing operation. The main purpose is savings runtime since retrieving a value from memory is often faster than undergoing a time consuming computation (see Space-time tradeoff). Lookup tables are also used to validate input values by matching against a list of valid (or invalid) items in an array.

<doc id="138172" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=138172" title="Avalanche effect">
Avalanche effect

In cryptography, the avalanche effect refers to an attractive property of block ciphers and cryptographic hash functions algorithms. 

The avalanche effect is satisfied if:
Both of above features allow small changes to propagate rapidly through iterations of the algorithm, in such a way that every bit of the output should depend on every bit of the input before the algorithm terminates.

The term "avalanche effect" was first used by Horst Feistel (Feistel 1973), although the concept was identified by "Shannon's property of confusion". 

If a block cipher or cryptographic hash function does not exhibit the avalanche effect to a significant degree, then it has poor randomization, and thus a cryptanalyst can make forecasts about the input, if given only the output. This may be sufficient to partially or completely break (crack) the algorithm. 

One of the primary design objectives in constructing a "quality" cipher or cryptographic hash function is to build a good avalanche effect. This is why most block ciphers are product ciphers. It is also why hash functions have large data blocks. 

The Strict Avalanche Criterion (SAC) is a property of boolean functions of importance to cryptography. A function is said to satisfy the strict avalanche criterion if, whenever a single input bit is complemented, each of the output bits should change with a probability of one half. 

The SAC was built on the concepts of completeness and avalanche and introduced by Webster and Tavares in 1985.

The Bit independence criterion (BIC) states that output bits "j" & "k" should change independently when any single input bit "i" is inverted, for all "i", "j" and "k".

The station was launched at 6pm on August 16, 2002. It was called "Network X" during the planning period. It is the sister station to BBC Radio 1 and is broadcast from the same building as Radio 1 - Yalding House in central London. This is part of the BBC's massive Broadcasting House complex of radio studios and other offices.

Typical music includes largely British and North American hip hop, grime, bassline, garage, dubstep, drum and bass, bashment, soca, reggae, gospel music, bhangra and R&B. It is available on digital radio (DAB), digital satellite television, digital terrestrial television (Freeview), and the Internet. It has its own news team: 1Xtra News.

1Xtra's audience is usually aged between 15 and 30 years old. The upper age range is deliberately lower than sister station Radio 1 which is closer to 35.

According to the "Submission to the Secretary of State's review of digital channels" in March 2004, 1Xtra "provides music output 24 hours a day, punctuated by bespoke BBC 
news bulletins and other speech output designed specifically to be pertinent to the

Barrel

Barrel is an old English word for a big holder of liquids, such as petrol, beer, wine or oil. Barrels are most commonly made of either wood or metal.

A barrel is also used to measure liquids. One barrel of oil is about 158.987 litres (42 US gallons). It is shortened as "b". This use may have come from the early Pennsylvanian oil fields where wooden barrels were used to store and move oil around. In 1866, the people of West Virginia started using it regularly. At this time, the amount was set to 42 gallons. It was later world-wide for measuring amounts of oil and pricing it.

The size of some standard barrels is not the same in all countries. Some countries have different sizes for different liquids.

Beverly Hills Chihuahua

Beverly Hills Chihuahua is a 2008 movie by Walt Disney Pictures directed by Raja Gosnell. The first preview of the movie was seen next to "", and originally the movie was stanted for a September 26, 2008 release, but the release was moved to October 3. The story is about a chihuahua who gets dognapped in Mexico and has to escape from an evil Doberman. "Destino", a 2003 short movie made by Walt Disney Pictures based on an idea started by Walt Disney and Salvador Dalí in the 1940s, was thought to be seen before "Beverly Hills Chihuahua", but this didn't happen. Insteed, a sneak-peek of the Disney movie "Bolt" was seen.

The movie is about a spolied chihuahua from Beverly Hills named Chloe (voiced by Drew Barrymore). Her owner, "Aunt Viv" (Jamie Lee Curtis), has to go to Italy, so she leaves Chloe with her niece, Rachel Ashe Lynn (Piper Perabo). Rachel and her friends go on vacation to Mexico, and Chloe gets dognapped by an evil Mexican dognapper who at first wants to use her in dog fights but sees her value and wishes to put her at randsome (have the owners have to pay money to get her back). In the meantime, Papi (voiced by George Lopez), a male chihuahua who is in love with her is on the lookout for her. Chloe makes friendship with a lonely German Shepherd named Delgado (voiced by Andy Garcia) who travels with her to protect her from the evil Doberman (voiced by Edward James Olmos) who wants to kill her and steal her diamond collar to return it to the dognapper who owns him.



The music to "Beverly Hills Chihuahua" was written by composer Heitor Pereira, who recorded the score with the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Eastwood Scoring Stage at Warner Brothers. 

"Beverly Hills Chihuahua" earned $29 million USD in its opening weekend. It was #1 in the box office for two weeks. Despite this, the movie was rather poorly received by critics.

Flower (Bambi)

Flower is a skunk character from Disney's animated movie "Bambi" voiced by Stan Alexander, Sterling Holloway, and Nicky Jones. He also appeared in "Bambi II", and is widely considered to be one of the world's most famous skunks, rivaled only by Warner Brothers Pepe le Pew. He is very popular in France .

In the first Bambi movie, Bambi is exploring with Thumper and meets a butterfly. Bambi thinks it's a bird but Thumper tells him what it is. Bambi then comes acrros a patch of flowers and calls one of the flowers butterfly. Thumper explains this, and says that the flowers are pretty. He then shows Bambi how to sniff the flowers. Bambi then comes nose-to-nose with a skunk which he calls flower. Thumpers rolls over laughing, and tries to explain, but the skunk says he likes the name. The name then sticks and it is never revealed what his real name is. In "Bambi II", Flower has a fear of turtles. Flower and Thumper try to help teach Bambi how to be brave for his father. 

Although Flower was meant to have a big role in Bambi's life, his part in the movie turned out to be only a minor one. His role in the first movie suffers somewhat from the fact that Thumper very much stole the show. Even in "Bambi II", where he had considerably more screentime, he was still not in the movie as much as Thumper. He is lovable, shy, and very effeminate. Although somewhat of a scaredy-cat, he will do what he can when the going gets tough.

Because of his (somewhat) feminine nature, (i.e., blushing, giggling, wanting Bambi to call him flower "if he wants to") Flower is often mistaken to be a girl.

Banksy

Banksy is a British street and graffiti artist. He likes to remain anonymous and not let people know his true identity. He often draws in high visibility public places such as on buildings or train stations. His paintings are often about politics, war and other important topics.

His satirical street art and mind-hurting pictures combine dark humour with graffiti. The graffiti is done in a well stencilling technique. Such works have been done on streets, walls, and bridges of cities throughout the world.

Banksy's work started in the Bristol underground scene, which had collaborations between artists and musicians. According to graphic designer Tristan Manco and the book "Home Sweet Home", Banksy "was born in 1974 and raised in Bristol, England. The son of a photocopier technician, he trained as a butcher but became involved in graffiti during the great Bristol aerosol boom of the late 1980s". His style is similar to Blek le Rat, who began to work with stencils in 1981 in Paris, and to members of the anarcho-punk band Crass, which did a graffiti stencil campaign on the London Underground system in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Banksy displays his art on public surfaces such as walls and even going as far as to build physical prop pieces. He does not sell photos of street graffiti directly himself. However, art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder. Banksy's first film, "Exit Through the Gift Shop", billed as "the world's first street art disaster movie," made its debut at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. The film was released in the UK on 5 March 2010. In January 2011, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary for the film.

List of sex positions

This list of sex positions is a list of different ways to have sexual intercourse and other sexual acts.

These positions involve a penis going into a vagina or anus.

These positions are used for vaginal or anal sex. The basic position is called the missionary position. In it, the receiving partner lies on his or her back with legs apart. The partner lies on top of the receiving partner, facing them. The penetrating partner enters so that the base of the penis rubs the clitoris.

Most of these positions can be used for either vaginal or anal sex.

The receiving partner is kneeling or on all four limbs. The penetrating partner his penis from behind.

Most of these positions can be used for either vaginal or anal sex.

The female is on her hands and knees with her bottom exposed to the male. The male then pumps away at the lady's vagina with his penis.

Most of these positions can be used for either vaginal or anal sex.

The penetrating partner sits down, with their legs stretched out. The receiving partner sits on top and wraps their legs around the penetrating partner. This is called pounding on the spot.

 Most of these positions can be used for either vaginal or anal sex and may endure full orgasm.

In the basic standing position, both partners stand facing each other and have vaginal sex. The shorter partner can stand on a stair if the partners are different heights. It may be easier if the woman has her back to a wall.

Most of the above positions can be used for anal sex.


Outercourse or frottage is sometimes part of foreplay or to avoid intercourse.

Genital-genital sex, sometimes called GG rubbing, is when two males rub penises together (sometimes called frottage) or when two females rub vulvae together (sometimes called tribadism).

Oral sex is the term given to genital stimulation by the mouth. People may engage in oral sex as part of foreplay before intercourse, or during or following intercourse. It may also be performed for its own sake.

Fellatio is a kind of oral sex that involves a man letting his penis be licked or "eaten" by his partner. The man's partner can be either a woman or another man. There are several ways to have oral sex.


Note: Fellatio doesn't have to involve 2 people. Some men have a long-enough penis and a good enough stretch to lick or put their own penis into their mouth. However, this is called autofellatio or autofellation.

Cunnilingus is oral sex involving a woman's genitals. There are several ways to have oral sex.


"Main article:" 69 (sex position)

Oral sex between two people at the same time is called 69. Partners can be lying side-by-side, lying one on top of the other, or standing with one partner holding the other upside down.

Positions for anilingus, also known as "rimming", "anal-oral sex" or "rimjob" are:


When three people have sex with each other, it is called a threesome. You can have:

His son, Henry A. S. Dearborn, was a Congressman in 1831-1833.

Mirepoix (cuisine)

Mirepoix () is the French name for a condiment used for cooking. Mirepoix consists of onions, carrots and celery (either common Pascal celery or celeriac). Mirepoix is used in many dishes, such as stocks, soups, stews and sauces. It is used either raw, roasted or sautéed with butter. Mirepoix is known as the holy trinity of French cooking.

These three ingredients are commonly referred to as aromatics. Similar such combinations, both in and out of the French culinary repertoire, sometimes include leeks, parsnips, garlic, tomatoes, shallots, mushrooms, bell peppers, chilies, and ginger. For the combination "mirepoix au gras", or a "Matignon", ham or pork belly are used as additional ingredients. In Cajun cuisine, a mirepoix or trinity is a combination of onions, celery and bell peppers.

They may be used in different combinations, as dictated by the cuisine and the dish itself.

Traditionally, the ratio for mirepoix is 2:1:1 of onions, celery, and carrots. The ratio for bones to mirepoix for stock is 10:1. When making a white stock, or "fond blanc", parsnips are used instead of carrots to maintain the pale color.

Mirepoix derives its name, as many other elements of French cuisine do, from the patron of the chef who established it, in this case one of the house of Lévis, seigneurs of Mirepoix since the eleventh century and a famous name in Languedoc. The particular member of the house of Lévis whose chef is credited by the "Dictionnaire de l'Académie française" with giving a name to an old technique is Charles-Pierre-Gaston François de Lévis, duc de Lévis-Mirepoix (1699-1757), maréchal de France and ambassador of Louis XV.

Béchamel sauce

Béchamel sauce ( in English, in French, in Italian), also known as white sauce, is a basic mother sauce. It can be used to make other sauces, such as Mornay sauce, which is Béchamel and cheese. This basic sauce is usually made today by whisking scalded milk gradually into a white flour-butter "roux" (equal part clarified butter and flour), though it can also be made by whisking a kneaded flour-butter beurre manié into scalded milk. The thickness of the final sauce depends on the proportions of milk and flour. Escoffier adds salt and an onion stuck with clove

It is named after Louis de Béchamel.

Battle of the Mediterranean

The Battle of the Mediterranean was the name given to the naval campaign fought in the Mediterranean Sea during World War II.

For the most part, the campaign was fought between the forces of the Italian Royal Navy ("Regia Marina"), supported by other Axis naval forces, 
and the forces of the British Royal Navy, supported by other Allied naval forces.

Each side had three overall goals in this battle. The first was to attack the supply lines of the other side. The second was to keep open its own supply lines, the Axis to their own armies in North Africa and the Allies to supply the island of Malta. The third was to destroy the ability of the opposing navy to wage war at sea. 

Outside of the Pacific ocean, the Mediterranean saw the largest conventional naval warfare during the war. In particular, Allied forces struggled to supply and retain the key naval and air base of Malta.

Italian warships had a general reputation as well-designed and good-looking. But some Italian cruiser classes were rather deficient in armour. All Italian warships lacked radar for most of the war, although the lack of radar was partly offset by the fact that Italian warships were equipped with good "rangefinder" and "fire-control" systems. In addition, whereas Allied commanders at sea had discretion on how to act, Italian commanders were closely and precisely governed by Italian Naval Headquarters ("Supermarina"). This could lead to action being avoided when the Italians had a clear advantage (e.g., During "Operation Hats" . Italian Naval Headquarters was conscious that the British could replace ships lost in the Mediterranean, whereas Italian Navy resources were limited and there was a terrible lack of fuel). 

The Italian Navy entered the war with only one year of fuel required to operate normally (in 1943 practically there was no fuel to do naval operations far away from the coasts of Italy).

The Allies had "Ultra" intercepts, which predicted the Italian movements, and radar, which enabled them to locate the ships and range their weapons at distance and at night. The better air reconnaissance skills of the "Fleet Air Arm" and their close collaboration with surface units were other major causes of the initial Italian defeats (like in the "Battle of Cape Matapan").

The Axis forces in this campaign were:-

The Allied forces in this campaign were:-

On 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on Britain and France. On the following day, Italian bombers attacked Malta on what was to be the first of many raids.
The first clash between the rival fleets, the Battle of Calabria, took place on 9 July 1940, just four weeks after the start of hostilities. This was inconclusive (neither side won), and was followed by a series of small ship actions ( the battle of the "Espero" convoy, battle of Cape Spada) during the autumn.

In spring 1940 the British Royal navy attacked at Mers el Kebir (Algeria) the French navy of Vichy, sinking 2 battleship with other minor ships.
In November, the RN mounted an aerial attack on the Italian fleet in Taranto harbour, crippling 3 capital ships and changing the balance of power in the Mediterranean.

Three months later the fleets clashed again at the Battle of Cape Matapan. This was a major Allied victory; 3 Italian cruisers were sunk, and a battleship damaged in a 2-day battle ending in a night action.

Following this the Allies suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Crete, supporting the army when the island was invaded by the Germans.

In spring 1941 the Greek and Yugoslavian navy were destroyed and/or made captive by the Italians (with help from the German air force) during the Italo-German war in the western Balkans against Greece and Yugoslavia.

Following the battle of Crete in the summer of 1941, the Royal Navy got the better of things in the central Mediterranean in a series of successful convoy attacks, (such as the "Duisburg" convoy and the Battle of Cape Bon) until the events around the First Battle of Sirte and the Raid on Alexandria in December swung the balance of power in the Axis favour.

The Italian Navy's most successful attack was when divers planted mines on British battleships during the raid on Alexandria harbour (19 December 1941). HMS "Queen Elizabeth" and HMS"Valiant" were sunk (but ten months later raised and returned to active service). During those ten months the Italian Navy enjoyed a temporary control of the Mediterranean sea (called by Mussolini's propaganda "the Italian Mare Nostrum").

A series of hard fought convoy battles (Second Battle of Sirte in March, Operations Harpoon and Vigorous in June, and Operation Pedestal in August) were victories for the Axis but ensured Malta's survival, until the Allies regained the advantage in November 1942.

In Sept 1943 with the Italian collapse and the surrender of Italian fleet, naval actions in Mediterranean became restricted to actions against U-boats and by small craft in the Adriatic and Aegean seas.


The following are the major amphibious operations staged during the Battle of the Mediterranean:

Cryptographic hash function

A cryptographic hash function is a transformation that takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size string, which is called the hash value (sometimes called a message digest, a digital fingerprint, a digest or a checksum). 

The ideal hash function has three main properties:

Functions with these properties are used as hash functions for a variety of purposes, not only in cryptography. Practical applications include message integrity checks, digital signatures, authentication, and various information security applications. 

A hash function takes a string of any length as input and produces a fixed length string which acts as a kind of "signature" for the data provided. In this way, a person knowing the "hash value" is unable to know the original message, but only the person who knows the original message can prove the "hash value" is created from that message.

A cryptographic hash function should behave as much as possible like a random function while still being deterministic and efficiently computable. A cryptographic hash function is considered "insecure" from a cryptographic point of view, if either of the following is computationally feasible:

An attacker who can find any of the above computations can use them to substitute an authorized message with an unauthorized one.

Ideally, it should be impossible to find two different messages whose digests ("hash values") are similar; nor would one want an attacker to be able to learn anything useful about a message given only its digest. Of course the attacker learns at least one piece of information, the digest itself, by which the attacker can recognise if the same message occurred (repeated) again.

In various standards and applications, the two most commonly used hash functions are MD5 and SHA-1. 

In 2005, security defects were identified showing that a possible mathematical weakness might exist, like attacks, and recommending a stronger hash function. 

In 2007 the National Institute of Standards and Technology announced a contest to design a hash function which will be given the name SHA-3 and be the subject of a FIPS standard.

Cryptosystem

There are two different meanings of the word cryptosystem. 

In this meaning, the term cryptosystem is used as shorthand, or as an abbreviation for "cryptographic system". A cryptographic system is any computer system that involves cryptography. Such systems include for instance, a system for secure electronic mail which might include methods for digital signatures, cryptographic hash functions, key management techniques, and so on. 

In this meaning, a cryptosystem refers to a set of algorithms needed to implement a method of encryption and decryption. 

Typically, a cryptosystem consists of three algorithms: 

The term "cipher" (sometimes "cypher") is often used to refer to a pair of (encryption/decryption) algorithms. Therefore, the term "cryptosystem" is most often used when the key generation algorithm is important. For this reason, the term "cryptosystem" is commonly used to refer to public key techniques; however both "cipher" and "cryptosystem" are used for symmetric key techniques.

The "Internet Security Glossary" RFC 2828 advises against using the term "cryptosystem", giving the following definitions.

Serpent (cipher)

Serpent is a symmetric key block cipher which was the second finalist in the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) contest after Rijndael. Serpent was designed by Ross Anderson, Eli Biham, and Lars Knudsen.

Serpent has a block size of 128 bits and supports a key size of 128, 192 or 256 bits. The cipher is a 32-round substitution-permutation network operating on a block of four 32-bit words. Each round applies one of eight 4-bit to 4-bit S-boxes 32 times in parallel. Serpent was designed so that all operations can be executed in parallel, using 32 1-bit slices. This maximizes parallelism, but also allows use of the extensive cryptanalysis work performed on DES.

Serpent was widely viewed as a more traditional approach to security than the other AES finalists choosing a larger security margin: the designers estimated 16 rounds to be sufficient against known types of attack, but specified 32 rounds as insurance against future progress in cryptanalysis.

The Serpent cipher has not been patented. It is completely placed in the public domain and can be freely used by anyone. 


The 32 rounds make Serpent more secure than Rijndael; however, Rijndael with 10 rounds is faster and easier to implement for small Block ciphers and on embedded system. For that reason, Rijndael was selected as the winner in the AES competition.

The XSL attack, if effective and would weaken Serpent (though not as much as it would weaken Rijndael, which became AES). However, many cryptanalysts believe that if implementations considered to overcome the XSL attack, the XSL attack would be more difficult than a brute force attack.

Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a computer program that provides cryptographic and authentication. PGP is often used for signing, encrypting and decrypting electronic mails (e-mails) to increase the security of e-mail communications. It was originally created by Philip Zimmermann in 1991.

PGP and other similar products follow the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880) for encrypting and decrypting data. 

OpenPGP is on the Internet Standards Track; the current specification is RFC 4880 (November 2007). OpenPGP is still under development and the successor to RFC 2440, which is RFC 4880, has been made a proposed standard. Many e-mail clients provide "OpenPGP-compliant" email security as described in RFC 3156.

The Free Software Foundation has developed its own "OpenPGP-compliant" program called GNU Privacy Guard (abbreviated GnuPG or GPG). GnuPG is freely available together with all source code under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and is maintained separately faraway from several Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) that interact with the GnuPG library for encryption, decryption and signing functions (see KGPG, Seahorse, MacGPG). Several other vendors have also developed "OpenPGP-compliant" software.

Weak key

In cryptography, a weak key is a key which when used with a specific cipher, makes the cipher behave in some undesirable way, and simplifies breaking (cracking) the ciphertext. 

Weak keys usually represent a very small fraction of the overall key space, which means that if someone generates a random key to encrypt a message, it is a rare condition that weak keys will cause a security problem. However, it is considered a good design for a cipher to have no weak keys ("quality chiper"). A cipher with no weak keys is said to have a "flat", or "linear", key space.

XSL attack

In cryptography, the XSL attack is a method of cryptanalysis for block ciphers. The attack was first published in 2002 by researchers Nicolas Courtois and Josef Pieprzyk. It was claimed that it may break the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher faster than a brute force attack. 

AES is already widely used in commerce and government for the transmission of secret and classified information. Finding a technique that can decrease the amount of time it takes to break the secret message without having the key could cause wide damage. 

In 2004 it was shown by one of the cryptanalysts, that the algorithm does not perform as described in its published paper. In addition, the method requires long effort. Unless shortened, the technique does not reduce the effort to break AES in comparison to a brute force attack. Therefore, it does not affect the real-world security of block ciphers in the near future. However, the attack has caused some experts to insert complexities in the algebraic simplicity of the current AES.

The XSL attack relies on first analyzing the "internal design" of a cipher then deriving a system of quadratic simultaneous equations. These systems of equations are typically very large, for example 8000 equations with 1600 variables for the 128-bit AES. Several methods for solving such systems are known. In the XSL attack, a specialized algorithm, termed XSL (eXtended Sparse Linearization), is then applied to solve these equations and compute the key.

The attack is well-known and famous for requiring only a handful of known plaintexts to perform. Previous methods of cryptanalysis, such as linear and differential cryptanalysis, often require unrealistically large numbers of known or chosen plaintexts, which make them impossible to realize.

Treaty of friendship and alliance between the Government of Mongolia and Tibet

Tibet and Mongolia signed a treaty called the Treaty of friendship and alliance between the Government of Mongolia and Tibet on February 2, 1913, at Urga (now Ulaanbaatar). Today, we are not sure if the treaty can be used or not.

The Qing Dynasty ended in 1911. After this, both Tibet and Mongolia were independent. Both had a lamaist head of state. The Republic of China did not see them as independent. In the treaty, both Mongolia and Tibet said they would see each other as independent, and help each other in war. 

The people who signed for Mongolia were foreign minister Da Lama Ravdan and General Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren. Those who signed for Tibet were Agvan Dorjiev, Chijamts, and Gendun-Galsan, who lived in Tibet. Dorjiev was a Buryat, a citizen of Russia. For this reason, the treaty may not be legal. The 13th Dalai Lama denied that he had let Dorjiev sign a treaty with Mongolia. More importantly, neither the cleric nor the Tibetan government has ever signed any treaty. The Russian government said that Dorjiev was Russian. He could therefore not act as a diplomat for the Dalai Lama. The Mongolian text of the treaty has been published by the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in 1982.

Most other people still did not see Mongolia or Tibet as independent. They said that these areas belonged to China. Western powers had made treaties with the Qing Dynasty, and China had said it would honour these treaties. If they had recognised either Tibet or Mongolia, these treaties would have become invalid. The main Western powers were the United Kingdom and Russia. Both feared that if they saw the countries as independent, they could come under the influence of the other western powers. In their opinion, that situation was worse than if China controlled both of them, because China was weak.

British negotiators at the Simla Convention heard about the treaty and got very suspicious. They feared that Russia might use the treaty to gain more influence in Tibet. In the end, China did not sign the Simla Convention. Instead, a very similar treaty was signed by Mongolia, China, and Russia on 25 May 1915. This treaty was called the tripartite Treaty of Kyakhta. The agreement stated that Mongolia was completely autonomous in internal matters and that Russia had certain privileges in Mongolia. At the same time it said that Mongolia was in fact a part of China.

Dissipation

In physics, dissipation includes the concept of a dynamical system where "important mechanical modes", such as waves or oscillations, lose energy over time, typically due to the action of friction or turbulence. The lost energy is converted into heat, raising the temperature of the system. Such systems are called dissipative systems. 

For example, a wave that loses amplitude is said to dissipate. The dissipative nature depends on the nature of the wave: an atmospheric wave, for instance, may dissipate close to the surface due to friction with the land mass, and at higher levels due to radiative cooling.

In computational physics, a numerical dissipation is also known as "artificial dissipation" or "artificial diffusion" or "numerical diffusion". They all mean this: when the pure advection equation--which, by definition, "is free of dissipation"--is solved by a numerical approximation method that reduces the amplitude and changes the shape of the initial wave in a way analogous (similar) to a diffusional process, the method is said to contain 'dissipation'.

In Hydrology, dissipation is the process of converting mechanical energy of downward flowing water into thermal and acoustical energy. Various devices are designed in stream-beds (river-banks) to reduce the kinetic energy of flowing waters to reduce their erosive potential on banks and river bottoms. Very often these devices look like small waterfalls or cascades, where water flows vertically or over riprap to lose some of its kinetic force.

Porta Alchemica

Porta Alchemica (English: "alchemical door") , or Alchemy Gate or Magic Portal, is an ancient monument built between 1678 and 1680 by "Massimiliano Palombara" marquis of Pietraforte (1614-1680) in his residence, Palombara villa, located in the east of Rome on the "Esquilino" hill in a position almost corresponding to "Piazza Vittorio", where today was placed. Porta Alchemica is the only survivor of the five gates of the Palombara villa, there was an lost door on the opposite side enabling to give it a date of 1680, there were also four other inscriptions lost on the walls of the mansion inside the villa.

According to a legend dated 1802 sent us by the scholar "Francesco Girolamo Cancellieri" , a pilgrim "stibeum" (from Latin: "stibium" = antimony) was hosted in the villa for a night. The "pellegrino", identifiable with the alchemist "Giustiniani Bono", stayed for a night in the gardens of the villa in search of a mysterious herb capable of producing gold, the next morning he was seen disappearing forever through the door, but left behind a few flakes of gold fruit of a successful alchemical transmutation, and a mysterious paper full of puzzles and magic symbols that would contain the secret of the Philosopher's Stone.

The marquis had engraved on the five gates of the villa Palombara and on the walls of the mansion, the content of the manuscript with symbols and riddles in the hope that one day someone would be able to understand them.

The interest of the Marquis Palombara for alchemy was born probably on his attendance since 1656, at the roman court of queen Christina of Sweden, at "Riario" palace (today "Palazzo Corsini") on the slopes of the "Gianicolo" hill. After the queen converted to Catholicism, she abdicated the throne of Sweden and he spent much of the rest of his life exiled in Rome from 1655 until her death in 1689.

Queen Christina had an alchemical laboratory in Riario palace attended by people like the esotericists "Giuseppe Francesco Borri", and the learned Athanasius Kircher possessor of the mysterious of enigmatic scripture full of magic symbols. According to a legend the same "Porta Alchemica" was built in 1680 as a celebration of a successful alchemical transmutation occurred in Riario laboratory.

Between 1678 and 1680 Borri aka "Giustiniani Bono", collaborated with Athanasius Kircher for construction of Porta Alchemica in Palombara villa. Gian Lorenzo Bernini, famous architect and Kircher friend, designed the door. On the door was transcribed the secret formula for producing gold discovery in those years in alchemical laboratory of queen Christina. Because of this revelation the Marquis Palombara, Bernini and Athanasius Kircher were murdered by poison at 28 November 1680, probably by the same Borri. The secret of the Philosopher's Stone was lost forever, or perhaps continued to be used by Borri. (It's amazing the similarity between portraits of Borri and the mysterious ).

The particular drawing on the pediment of Porta Alchemica, with the two triangles overlap and inscriptions in Latin, appears almost exactly the same on the title of the book alchemical "Aureum Seculum Redivivum" of "Henricus Madatanus" aka "Adrian von Mynsicht" (1603-1638). The title page of the original of 1621 is very different, because the design that was inspired the Marquis Palombara appears exactly only in the posthumous edition of 1677. The same drawing appears in a bookmark possessed by "Berenger Saunière", who became the parish priest at in 1885. The motto "Aureum Seculum Redivivum" recalled this "Novus Ordo Seclorum" in the Great Seal of the United States, motto also of the Bavarian Illuminati heirs of the 17th century .

Springfield, Massachusetts

Springfield is a city in Massachusetts, United States. In the year 2010, 153,084 people lived in the city and 700,000 people live in Metropolitan Springfield. Springfield is the largest city on the Connecticut River, and located at a natural crossroads where three rivers flow into the Connecticut River. One of Springfield's nicknames is "The City of Firsts" because many famous inventions came from there, like:


Springfield is near Hartford, Connecticut. The two cities are only 24 miles (38 km) apart. Airline service to Springfield and Hartford is provided from Bradley International Airport. Bradley is 12 miles (19km) away from Springfield, and 12 miles (19km) away from Hartford. 

Many famous people are from Springfield: Dr. Seuss, the author, is from there. John Brown, the abolitionist, started his abolitionism here. James MacNeill Whistler, the famous painter, lived there too. Timothy Leary, the LSD activist was born there. Milton Bradley, the game-maker made his games, like "The Game of Life," and "Chutes and Ladders" there. Charles Goodyear, the man who invented vulcanized rubber, first made it in Springfield.

Springfield's other nicknames are "The City in a Forest," because it has a lot of trees in it, and "The City of Homes" because it has many big Victorian houses.

Springfield has two professional sports teams, the Springfield Falcons AHL ice hockey team, and the Springfield Armor NBA D-League basketball team. Both teams play home games at the MassMutual Center on Main Street in Springfield.

Many trains and buses meet in Springfield, because it is close to big cities like New York City, Boston, Montreal, and Albany. It is also next to New England's largest river, the Connecticut River. Springfield has always been a city that has welcomed immigrants.

If you visit Springfield, you can go to the Basketball Hall of Fame, or The Quadrangle museums - a group of art, science, and history museums around the Dr. Seuss sculptures. You could go to the Club Quarter, where there are many restaurants, bars, and discos. You could go to Forest Park, where there is a zoo, different sports fields, and a lake.

Global apartheid

Global apartheid is a term used to mean the worldwide control of resources, the economy, and government by an ethnic minority. The term comes from apartheid, a governmental system that ruled South Africa in which the Afrikaners, or "whites", controlled most of the resources and where non-whites were denied access to these resources. The term is often used to describe the gap between whites and nonwhites, and global socioeconomic inequality, the existence of which has been proven by statistics. European countries control most of the world's technology and weapons, and 20% of the global population, the richest percentage, take in 71.3% of income. Although most people of the world are not white, thereby making whites a minority, this minority often holds power in society. 

The term was famously used by Thabo Mbeki, the then-President of South Africa, in a 2002 speech, drawing comparisons the modern-day status of the world's people, economy, and access to natural resources to the apartheid era.

Wikipedia:Let it slide

Let it slide is a phrase in the English language, which asks a person not to hold on so tightly that something they are holding cannot move or "slide". It is most often used when a person insists on an idea, and tries so hard to convince another person of that idea, that it seems nothing else matters. A friend may say ""Let it slide, even though this is important, you can take an easy approach and any damage, if any damage, will not be too severe.""

When you disagree strongly about an article, but it is not completely incorrect or damaging, just let it slide for a bit. If it is seriously wrong, another person will eventually come to your aid but if you press all you can on your own before any help arrives, it may be too late. So, don't give up your idea but for now, "let it slide".

The Big Bang Theory

The Big Bang Theory is an American situation comedy created and executive produced by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, which premiered on CBS on September 24, 2007.

It concerns two male Caltech prodigies in their twenties, one an experimental physicist (Leonard) and the other a theoretical physicist (Sheldon), who live across the hall from an attractive blonde waitress with show-biz aspirations (Penny).

Leonard and Sheldon's geekiness and intellect are contrasted with Penny's social skills and common sense for comedic effect. Two equally geeky friends of theirs, Howard and Rajesh, are also main characters. The show is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre Productions. "The Big Bang Theory" was recently picked up for a third and fourth season by CBS. 


The show was first developed for the 2006-2007 television season, but it was fundamentally different to the show we see today. Only Jim Parsons & Johnny Galecki were part of the original pilot, and the character now played by Kaley Cuoco was much meaner to the geeks. CBS did not pick the show up, but gave Bill Prady and Chuck Lorre a second chance. They brought in Kaley Cuoco, along with Simon Helberg & Kunal Nayyar, and retooled the show.

The second pilot of "The Big Bang Theory" was directed by award-winning television directing veteran James Burrows, who decided not to stay with the show. This reworked pilot led to a 13-episode order by CBS on May 14, 2007. Prior to its airing on CBS, the pilot episode was distributed on iTunes free of charge. The show premiered September 24, 2007, and was picked-up for a full 22-episode season order on October 19, 2007.

Production on the show was halted on November 6, 2007 by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. As the strike ended, the show was picked up for a second season along with eleven other shows for the 2008-2009 television season.

The show returned on March 17, 2008 with an earlier time slot and nine new episodes. The second season premiered, in the same slot, on September 22, 2008. During the course of this season, the show bucked the trend of many other returning shows and saw its ratings grow, leading to a 
two-year renewal through what would be the 2010-11 season.

David Saltzberg, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California, Los Angeles, checks scripts and provides dialogue, math equations and diagrams used as props. He says he's more consultant than contributor. Executive producer/co-creator Bill Prady said, "In fact, we're working on giving Sheldon an actual problem that he's going to be working on throughout the [first] season so there's actual progress to the boards ... We worked hard to get all the science right."

Barenaked Ladies wrote and recorded the theme song, which describes developments the universe has undergone since the dawn of time. On October 9, 2007, a full-length (1 minute and 45 second) version of the song was released.

In the following summary, "rating" is the percentage of all households with televisions that tuned to the show, and "share" is the percentage of all televisions in use at that time that are tuned in. "18-49" is the percentage of all adults aged 18–49 tuned into the show. "Viewers" is the number of viewers, in millions, watching at the time. "Rank" is how well the show did compared to other TV shows aired that week. 

Seasonal ratings based on average total viewers per episode of "The Big Bang Theory" on CBS:

The show made its UK debut on Channel 4 on February 14, 2008 bringing in an average audience of 1.0 million viewers. The second episode, shown the following week, also received 1.0 million. For the third episode an average of 1.1 million tuned in. The show is also shown as a 'first-look' on Channel 4's digital offshoot E4 the preceding evening, and brings in 400,000 viewers on average. The 5th episode received 880,000 viewers. After the first 5 episodes, the average number of viewers continues to hover around the 1 million mark. Episode 13 was watched by 1.3 million viewers and was the most watched episode.

In December 2008, Virgin Media made the first nine episodes of the first season available to watch on its TV Choice On Demand service, and the rest of Season 1 was made available in January 2009.

The show is also broadcast in:

It will also soon be broadcasting in:

Smilodon

Smilodon was a genus of saber-toothed cat. There were three species. "Smilodon fragilis" was the ancestral, smaller, species (2.5 to 0.5 million years ago. 

"Smilodon populator" (1mya to 10kya) was a large, heavy species from eastern South America. It was 1.2 m high at the shoulder, 2.1 m (83 in) long on average. With an estimated weight of 220 to 400 kg, it was among the heaviest known felids. Its upper canines reached 28 cm (11 in) and protruded up to 17 cm (6.7 in) out of the upper jaw. 

"Smilodon fatalis" (or "S. californicus"; 1.6mya to 10,000 years ago) was the famous cat known from the Rancho La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles. The tar, a bit like asphalt, has yielded about a million bones of late Pleistocene mammals, of which 162,000 bones are from "Smilodon", representing perhaps 1200 individuals. The cat was about about the size of a female lion, but weighed more, perhaps 200kg. It was about 1 metre tall at the shoulders.

The front limbs on these cats were longer and stronger than modern cats, and from that, and its teeth, its method of attack must have been different. An educated guess would be: they were an ambush predators, which clung on round the neck of their prey, and slashed at the underside of the throat. This contrasts with the method of the modern lion, which brings down its prey by weight of numbers, and clamps its jaws over the prey's nose and mouth. The prey dies of suffocation. 

"Smilodon"'s niche was closer to a leopard's, which is also an ambush predator. They both need cover to get close to prey.
"Smiloddon" had relatively short legs and a short, bobbed tail. Its front legs were especially powerful. Its body was adapted for springing onto prey, but it was not a very fast runner. 

During the last Ice age, there were the following possible prey species from the La Brea location: Mammoths and Mastodons; Ground Sloths; Bison, Camel; Horse; Peccary; Pronghorn; Tapir; Deer (Elk & other). Most of these went extinct by 5 to 10,000 years ago. The pressures of a major climate change and human hunting were the main causes.
The climate at the time was much cooler than today, with more plant cover. Juniper, Oaks, Ragweeds, Cedars, Redwoods, Sagebrush, Sycamore, Thistle and Walnut grew in the environs. Both the herbivores and the cover were essential for its mode of life. "Smilodon" survived so long as game and cover lasted.

Cloth mill Offermann

In the 18th century, the cloth mill Offermann was a brass factory in the German city of Stolberg. It was later changed to cloth mill and then to a restaurant and apartment building. The changes show the change of economical needs in that city.

The building was founded as a brass factory. In the 18th century, it was one of many brass factories in the city.

At the end of the 18th century, the brass industry in Stolberg lost importance. The building was sold to a clothier of the nearby village of Imgenbroich. He produced cloth for more than 60 years.

At the beginning of the 19th century, the building was used as a restaurant. Some parts of the building were greatly in need of repair. 

At the end of the 20th century, major repairs were done to the building. Currently, it is used as an apartment building.

Dalek

The Daleks are a fictional alien race of mutants from the British science fiction television series "Doctor Who". Daleks are aliens from the planet Skaro, integrated within a tank-like mechanical casing. The creatures are a powerful race who always wanted universal conquest and domination, they have no pity, compassion or remorse (as all of their emotions were removed except hate).

The Daleks are one of the most powerful races ever in "Doctor Who" history and are the Doctor's worst enemies. They cry "EX-TER-MIN-ATE!" when they are about to kill someone. They come in different colours, like bronze, black, red, white, gold, and silver. They first appeared in the first season episode of the series (in "The Daleks") and they were last seen in the two-part episode "The Pandorica Opens"/"The Big Bang" (2010). They are not robots, but horrible aliens kept in a metal casing, because they became mutated during a war on their planet, Skaro. They were created by an evil scientist named Davros. They can not be easily hurt by guns as their casing reflects the bullets that come from the gun.

Daleks were created by writer Terry Nation and designed by BBC designer Raymond Cusick . They were introduced in December 1963 in the second "Doctor Who" serial. From their first apperence they were very popular with viewers, was ment that they were in a lot of later serials and two 1960s motion pictures. 
The word "Dalek" has been put into the "Oxford English Dictionary" and other major dictionaries; the "Collins Dictionary" defines it rather broadly as "any of a set of fictional robot-like creations that are aggressive, mobile, and produce rasping staccato speech". Although there is no meaning to their name, "Dalek" sounds like the Norwegian word "dårlig", which means "bad" or "evil". It is also a trademark, having first been registered by the BBC in 1964 to protect its range of Dalek merchandise. 

The Daleks were on a postage stamp celebrating British popular culture in 1999, photographed by Lord Snowdon.

On the outside, Daleks resemble human-sized salt and pepper shakers who are five to six feet (152 to 183 cm) tall, with a single robotic eyestalk ontop of a turning dome, an exterminator arm which is a energy weapon (or "death ray"), which looks like an long egg beater or the framework of a paint roller, and in some episodes fired a gas and can also be fitted with a projectile weapon; and a telescoping robot plunger shaped arm. 

Early versions of the Daleks were rolled around on castors or moved by wheels connected to hand cranks by bicycle chains. 
Later versions of the prop had more efficient wheels (from shopping carts, according to a Blue Peter episode) and were simply moved by the seated operators' feet, but they remained so heavy that when going up ramps they often had to be pushed by stagehands out of where the camrea could not see. The difficulty of operating all the prop's parts at once contributed to the occasionally jerky movements of the Dalek. The latest model of the costume still has a human operator within, but the movement of the dome and eyestalk are now remotely controlled so that the operator can concentrate on the smooth movement of the Dalek and its arms.

Dalek history inside the show has seen many changes, which have caused continuity problems. When the Daleks first appeared in "The Daleks", they were presented as the descendants of the Dals, mutated after a brief nuclear war between the Dal and Thal races. However, in 1975, Terry Nation revised the Daleks' origins in "Genesis of the Daleks", where the Dals were now called Kaleds (of which Daleks is an anagram), and the Dalek design was attributed to one man, the crippled Kaled chief scientist Davros. 

Instead of a short nuclear exchange, the Kaled-Thal war was portrayed as a thousand-year-long war, fought with nuclear and other weapons causing widespread mutations among the Kaled race. Davros experimented on living Kaled cells to find the ultimate mutated form of the Kaled species and placed the subjects in "travel machines" whose design was based on his own life-support chair. 

"Genesis of the Daleks" marked a new era for the depiction of the species, with most of their previous history either forgotten or barely talked about again.

A single Dalek appeared in "Dalek", written by Robert Shearman, which was broadcast on BBC One on 30 April 2005. This Dalek appeared to be the sole Dalek survivor of a Time War that had destroyed both the Daleks and the Time Lords.

The Dalek Emperor returned at the end of the 2005 series, having rebuilt the Dalek race with human subjects; it saw itself as a god, and the new Daleks were shown worshipping it. These Daleks and their fleet were reduced to subatomic particles in "The Parting of the Ways".

The 2006 series finale "Army of Ghosts"/"Doomsday" saw another squad of Dalek survivors from the old Empire, known as the Cult of Skaro, led by a black Dalek named "Dalek Sec", that had survived the Time War by escaping into the Void between dimensions. They emerged, along with a Time Lord prison containing millions of Daleks, at Canary Wharf due to the actions of the Torchwood Institute and Cybermen from a parallel world, leading to a Cyberman-Dalek clash in London. Eventually, the Tenth Doctor caused both factions to be sucked back into the Void. However, the Cult members (Sec, Caan, Jast, and Thay; it is unusual for a Dalek to have a name) survived by "temporal shifting" away. The two-part story "Daleks in Manhattan"/"Evolution of the Daleks" revealed they had escaped to 1930 New York, setting up base in the Empire State Building. Experiments led by Sec attepted to force a Dalek evolution by combining their DNA with that of humans, and he is the first of the new "Human Daleks". However the three remaining Daleks rebelled and destroyed him. The Cult also attempted to create a Human/Dalek hybrid (fully human in appearance but with Dalek minds). This attempt failed after the Doctor interfered. Caan escaped via another temporal shift.

The Daleks returned in the 2008 series' two-part finale, "The Stolen Earth"/"Journey's End", accompanied once again by their creator Davros (now played by Julian Bleach). It is revealved that Dalek Caan had forced himself back into the Time War, even though it was time-locked (the effort rendered him insane), where he rescued Davros; Davros then created a new army of Daleks from his own flesh. The new Dalek army was led by a Supreme Dalek, who kept Davros imprisoned in a "Vault"; Davros said that he and the Supreme Dalek had reached "an arrangement". Davros and the Daleks planned to destroy all creation with a 'reality bomb', which failed due to the interference of the Doctor and his companions, and due to Caan himself who had been manipulating the events unknown to either side. Though the Daleks were destroyed, the fate of Davros and Dalek Caan is unknown. 3 Daleks from this episode came back in Series 5 (Victory of the Daleks). They created 5 new, different colored daleks. These new Daleks escaped. Later, they showed up in "The Pandorica Opens" and trapped the Doctor in the Pandorica, the ultimate prison. After they were erased from time by the cracks, a stone Dalek showed up, which was an echo of the Dalek race. It was brought alive by the Pandorica light, which could restore thing which had been erased by the cracks. It was later shot in the eye by River Song. Their race, along with the rest of the universe, was brought back by the Doctor.

Vocal chords

The vocal cords or vocal folds are two sets of tissue streched across the larynx. They can be places in such a way that they vibrate when air passes through the larynx. This will produce sounds. Humans can use them to produce language.

Men and women have different vocal fold sizes. Adult male voices are usually "deeper' - males have larger folds. The male vocal folds are between 17 mm and 25 mm in length.

The female vocal folds are between 12.5 mm and 17.5 mm long.

Folds are pearly white - females have whiter chords than males.

The difference in vocal fold size between men and women means that their voices have a different pitch. Each person's voice is different and has a slightly different pitch. This is caused by genes that influence how the larynx is made.

The vocal folds discussed above are sometimes called 'true vocal folds' to distinguish them from the false vocal folds. These are a pair of thick folds of mucous membrane. They sit directly above the true vocal folds, to protect them. They have a very small role in normal speech formation, but are often used in musical screaming and the death grunt singing style. They are also used in Tuvan throat singing.

The false folds are also called vestibular folds and ventricular folds. They can be seen on the diagram above as "ventricular folds".

Unlike the true vocal cords, the false ones grow back completely when they are removed by surgery.

Parallel computing

Parallel computing is a form of computation in which many instructions are carried out simultaneously (termed "in parallel"), depending on the theory that large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, and then solved concurrently ("in parallel"). 

There are several different forms of parallel computing: 

It has been used for many years, mainly in high-performance computing, with a great increase in its use in recent years, due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. Parallel computing has become the main model in computer architecture, mainly in the form of Multi-core processors. However, in recent years, power consumption by parallel computers has become a concern.

Parallel computers can be classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism—with multi-core and multi-processor computers having multiple processing elements inside a single machine, while clusters, blades, MPPs, and grids use multiple computers to work on the same task. 

Parallel computer programs are more difficult to program than sequential ones, because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential software bugs, of which race conditions and dead locks are the most common. however many parallel programming languages have been created to simplify parallel computers programming. But still Communication and synchronization between the different subtasks is difficult while achieving good parallel program performance.

Embedded system

An Embedded system is a computer that has been built to solve only a few very specific problems. Very often, such systems must give an answer in a specified time. This is called real-time computing. These computers are usually "embedded", they are parts of different devices. In contrast, a general-purpose computer can do many different tasks depending on programming. Embedded systems control many of the common devices in use today.

Embedded systems use embedded operating systems which are often real-time operating systems. These operating systems are designed to be very compact and efficient. They leave out many of the functions the embedded computer never uses.

Since the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, design engineers can optimize it, reducing the size and cost of the product, or increasing the reliability and performance. 

Physically, embedded systems range from portable devices such as MP3 players and digital cameras, to large systems like traffic lights, factory controllers, or the systems controlling nuclear power plants. 

Complexity varies from very low, with a single microcontroller chip, to very high with multiple microcontroller units with peripherals and networks mounted inside a large chassis or enclosure.

In general, "embedded system" is not an exactly defined term, as many systems can load and run applications. For example, Mobile devices share some elements with embedded systems — such as the operating systems and microprocessors which runs them — but are not truly embedded systems, because they allow different applications to be loaded and peripherals to be connected like general-purpose computers. 

Embedded systems are used in all aspects of modern life and there are many examples of their use, including:

Telecommunications systems uses huge amount of embedded systems from telephone switches to mobile phone network.
Computer networking uses dedicated routers and bridges to route data.

Consumer electronics include personal digital assistants (PDAs), MP3 players, mobile phones, video game consoles, digital cameras, DVD players, GPS receivers, and printers.
Many household appliances, such as microwave ovens, washing machines and dishwashers, are including embedded systems to provide flexibility, efficiency and features.

Transportation systems from aeroplanes to automobiles uses embedded systems.
New airplanes contain advanced avionics such as autopilot, inertial guidance systems and GPS receivers.
Various electric motors are using embedded electronic motor controllers.
Automobiles, electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles are increasingly using embedded systems to maximize efficiency and reduce pollution.


Embedded systems range from no user interface at all — doing only to one job — to complex graphical user interfaces and consoles similar to modern computer with desktop operating systems.

Simple embedded devices use buttons, LEDs, and small character- or digit-only displays, often with a simple menu system.

A full graphical touch screen having buttons with the meaning of the buttons changing with each screen as in smart phones.

Embedded processors (CPUs) can be divided into two categories: ordinary microprocessors (μP) and microcontrollers (μC). Microcontrollers (μC) have many more peripherals on chip, reducing the cost and size. 

The main differences between embedded CPUs and the general-purpose CPUs; used by personal computers and servers, are:

PC/104 and PC/104+ are examples of available "ready made" computer boards intended for small, low-volume and high-volume embedded systems. These often use DOS, Linux, NetBSD, or an embedded real-time operating system such as MicroC/OS-II, QNX or VxWorks.

In certain applications, where small size is un-important, the components used may be like those used in general purpose computers. Boards such as the VIA EPIA range help to narrow the gap by being PC-compatible, such boards are highly integrated, physically smaller or have other properties which make them attractive to embedded engineers. The advantage of this method is that low-cost products and components may be used along with the same software development tools used for general software development. Examples of such embedded devices are the ATMs.

A common configuration for "very-high-volume" embedded systems is the system on a chip (SoC) which holds a complete system consisting of (multiple) processors, multipliers, caches and interfaces on a single integrated circuit. SoCs can be implemented as an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or by using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA).

Embedded Systems talk with the outside world via peripherals, such as:

As for other software, embedded system designers use compilers, assemblers, and debuggers to develop embedded system software. However, they may also use some more specific tools:


Software tools can come from several sources:

As the complexity of embedded systems grows, higher level tools and operating systems are moving toward the embedding industry, example of such systems are the open programming environment including Linux, NetBSD, OSGi or Embedded Java, etc.

Embedded Debugging may be performed at different levels, depending on the features available. From simplest to most complicated they can be grouped into the following areas:

Unless restricted to external debugging, the programmer can typically load and run software through the tools, view the code running in the processor, and start or stop its operation. The view of the code may be as assembly code or source-code.

Because an embedded system is often composed of a wide variety of elements, the debugging strategy may vary. For instance, debugging a software- (and microprocessor-) centric embedded system is different from debugging an embedded system where most of the processing is performed by peripherals (DSP, FPGA, co-processor).
An increasing number of embedded systems today use more than one single processor core. A common problem with multi-core development is the proper synchronization of software execution. In such a case, the embedded system design may wish to check the data traffic on the busses between the processor cores, which requires very low-level debugging, at signal/bus level, with a logic analyzer, for instance.

Embedded systems often reside in machines that are expected to run continuously for years without errors, and in some cases recover by themselves if an error occurs. Therefore the software is usually developed and tested more carefully than that for personal computers, and unreliable mechanical moving parts such as disk drives, switches or buttons are avoided.

Specific reliability issues may include:

A variety of techniques are used, sometimes in combination, to recover from errors -- both software bugs such as memory leaks, and also soft errors in the hardware:


There are several different types of embedded software designs in common use.

In this design, the software simply has a loop. The loop calls subroutines, each subroutine manages a part of the hardware or software.

Some embedded systems are mainly interrupt controlled. This means that tasks performed by the system are generated by different kinds of events. An interrupt could be generated for example by a timer in a predefined frequency, or by a serial port receiving a byte.

These kinds of systems have a main loop which runs a simple task, this tasks is not very sensitive to time. Sometimes the interrupt handler adds longer tasks to be executed by the main loop. 

A nonpreemptive multitasking system which is very similar to the ""simple control loop"" design, except that the loop is hidden in an API. The programmer defines a set of tasks, each task gets its turn to "run", when it finsh it calls a routine to run the next task.

Unlike ""simple control loop"" systems, adding new software is easier, by simply writing a new task and adding it to the tasks queue.

In this type of system, a certain method is used to switch between tasks or threads based on a timer interrupt. At this level the system is considered to have an "operating system" kernel and can run tasks in parallel.

Because of the complexities of parallel computing, it is common to buy a real-time operating system, allowing programmers to concentrate on embedded applications and devices functionality rather than operating system details.

A microkernel is a logical step up from a real-time operating system. The usual arrangement is that the operating system kernel allocates memory and switches the CPU to different threads of execution. User mode processes implement major functions such as file systems, network interfaces, etc.

In general, microkernels succeed when the task switching and inter-task communication is fast, and fail when they are slow.

Exokernels communicate in a good way by normal subroutine calls. The hardware and software in the system are available to, and extendable by, application programmers.

In this case, a large kernel with complex capabilities and features is used by the embedded system. This gives programmers an environment similar to a desktop operating system like Linux or Microsoft Windows, and is therefore very good for development; However requires more hardware resources, more expensive, and can be less reliable; because of the complexity of these kernels.

Common examples of embedded monolithic kernels are Embedded Linux and Windows CE.

Other than the higher price of hardware, many peoples like this type of embedded systems, especially for more powerful devices such as Wireless Routers and GPSs. Here are some of the reasons:


In addition to the embedded operating system, many embedded systems have additional upper-layer software components. These components consists of networking protocol stacks like TCP/IP, FTP and HTTP, also includes storage features like disk partitioning and Flash memory management systems.

Airbag

An airbag is a part of the safety restraint system in cars. Airbags are bags that rapidly fill with air when an accident happens. That way they can prevent injuries that occur because the driver hit a hard object.

An airbag is a useful vehicle safety device. Airbags are used in the world increasingly because in accidents, it can help passengers reduce shock. 
When the sensor feels a strong shock, the gas device explodes. This gas fills the bag immediately. 

An American inventor, Dr. Allen S. Breed, invented and developed a key component for automotive use. Breed Corporation then marketed this innovation first in 1967 to Chrysler. A similar "Auto-Ceptor" crash-restraint, developed by Eaton, Yale & Towne Inc. for Ford was soon offered as an automatic safety system in the USA. The Italian Eaton-Livia company offered a variant with localized air cushions.

The first patent on an inflatable crash-landing device for airplanes was filed during World War II. In the 1980s, the first commercial airbags appeared in automobiles. Since model year 1990, all new cars sold in the United States have been required to have airbags on both driver and passenger sides. To date, statistics show that airbags reduce the risk of dying in a direct frontal crash by about 30 percent. Today, some cars have six or even eight airbags.

First, moving objects have momentum (the product of the mass and the velocity of an object). If no outside force acts on an object, the object will continue to move at its present speed and direction (because of inertia). Cars consist of several objects, including the vehicle itself, loose objects in the car and, of course, passengers. If these objects are not restrained, they will continue moving at whatever speed the car is traveling at, even if the car is stopped by a collision. 
Stopping an object's momentum requires force acting over a period of time. When a car crashes, the force required to stop an object is very great because the car's momentum has changed instantly while the passengers' has not (there is not much time to work with). The goal of any supplemental restraint system is to help stop the passenger while doing as little damage to him or her as possible. 
What an airbag wants to do is to slow the passenger's speed to zero with little or no damage. The constraints that it has to work within are huge. The airbag has the space between the passenger and the steering wheel or dashboard and a fraction of a second to work with. Even that tiny amount of space and time is valuable, however, if the system can slow the passenger evenly rather than forcing an abrupt halt to his or her motion.

Fucking, Austria

Fucking () is an Austrian village in the municipality of Tarsdorf, in the Innviertel region of western Upper Austria.

The village is 33 kilometres north of Salzburg, four kilometres east of the German border and can be travelled to in half an hour by car from the town of Petting, in Bavaria.

Fucking has existed since at least 1070 and is named after a man from the 6th century called "Focko". In old Germanic, "-ing" is used to describe people as belonging to their leader; so "Fucking" means "(place of) Focko’s people." The village has a population of 104.

Fucking's most famous feature is a traffic sign with its name on it, which tourists often photograph. This street sign is often stolen. Significant public funds have been spent on replacing the stolen signs.

In 2004, because many signs had been stolen, a vote was held to change the village name, but the villagers voted not to change. In August 2005, the road signs were welded to a very strong pole. Some signs have been stolen since 2005 but not as many.

Ravenscraig

Ravenscraig is an area of land in North Lanarkshire, Scotland. It used to be the site for steelworks. Ravenscraig used to have the largest steel mill in Western Europe. Ravenscraig was closed in 1992, and is now almost totally demolished.

Ravenscraig is now at the start of a major redevelopment by Wilson Bowden Developments Ltd, Scottish Enterprise and Corus, to create a full new town.

Ravenscraig is very easy to get to. More than two—thirds of Scotland’s population live within 90 minutes drive.

Located in North Lanarkshire, Ravenscraig is between the towns of Wishaw and Motherwell, who house a population of over 60,000. 

Ravenscraig lies only a few minutes drive from both the M74 and the M8 motorways which lead to Glasgow and Edinburgh, Scotland's two largest cities, allowing easy access for commuters and visitors to the area.

Another steel maker, Colvilles, decided to expand their business in July 1954. They were the largest steel manufacturer before World War II.

In 1954, Colvilles began the first stages of development in Ravenscraig. Turning Ravenscraig from an empty field into a site for steelworks. By 1957 most of the machinery was built and by 1959 the full building work was complete.

The closure of Ravenscraig in 1993 was the end of large scale steel making in Scotland; and was the cause of a loss of 770 jobs, and another 10,000 job losses directly and indirectly linked.

In its current state, Ravenscraig is one of the largest derelict sites in Europe measuring over 1125 acres in size, an area equivalent to 700 football pitches or twice the size of Monaco.

After many years of planning, Ravenscraig will be rebuilt by three equal companies: Wilson Bowden Developments Ltd, Scottish Enterprise and Corus and will be one of the largest regenerations in Europe, with 400 acres being developed. 

Ravenscraig will be home to several new facilities:
Part of the development will be to create new habitats for the wildlife already living in the area, such as deer, foxes, hares, otters, badgers, watervoles, butterflies and many birds.An "Ecological Clerk of Works" has been appointed to make sure the building works do not affect wildlife.

It is hoped that the £29million redevelopment of the sports complex will be used as training camps for the 2012 London Olympics and the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

There are many people who disagree with the building work. Many local residents and small businesses think that it will take jobs and customers from other towns.

As part of the changes, the transport to Ravenscraig will be improved. There will be new transport within walking distance of the new town centre. With new bus services to Glasgow and Lanark. There will be easy access to public transport throughout the site including dedicated business routes. These will link to the public transport network with roads to the Motherwell and Carfin rail stations..

Local press has suggested that the local Scottish Premier League football team, Motherwell Football Club could buy some land in Ravenscraig to build a new football stadium, leaving behind their home of 113 years, Fir Park. Motherwell Chairman, John Boyle has said ""No decisions have been taken and we are simply exploring realistic options at this stage.""

Inner core

The inner core is the very center of the planet and is the hottest part of a planet. The inner core was discovered by Inge Lehmann in 1929. Inge Lehmann was studying a large New Zealand earthquake. An earthquake makes which move across the inside of the Earth. The vibrations that Inge Lehmann was studying from the New Zealand earthquake seemed to be moving across something solid in the center of the planet. She called this the inner core and wrote about this inner core for many years but it was not proven to exist until 1970, when studies were much more exact. I personaly think it should be green.

The inner core is between 300 and 400 kilometers wide and more than 5,000 kilometers below the earth's surface. It is believed to be made of (melted) iron and nickel but the Earth is so heavy that the inner core does not move like a liquid. Scientists believe that the inner core may be hotter than the surface (edge) of the Sun at near 106,000 °C.

The inner core was thought to be a type of huge diamond because diamonds are made by huge weight pressing down but studying the way the Earth vibrates shows that the inner core is not as solid as a diamond. There may be smaller diamonds but it is not possible to know because of the huge heat and weight of the world.

A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld

"A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules From the Centre of the Ultraworld" is a mix of a song by the ambient house group The Orb. The song is about being in love with a beautiful person. The song was at first a Minnie Riperton song called Lovin' You. The Orbs version was first sold in October 1989 and was in the UK Singles Chart in 1990, at number 78.. In April 1991, it was sold as part of the album "The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld". The name is taken from a sound effects track from "Blake's 7" on "BBC Sound Effects No. 26 - Sci-Fi Sound Effects" called "The Core, A Huge Evergrowing Pulsating Brain which Rules from the Centre of Ultraworld".

In 1989, The Orb, with Martin "Youth" Glover, developed the musical style of ambient house using samples. The best of their musical work came when The Orb recorded music for John Peel on BBC Radio 1. The song, then known as "Loving You", was made quickly with many sound effects and samples from science fiction radio plays, nature sounds, and Minnie Riperton's "Lovin' You". Before the song was sold by record company Big Life, The Orb changed the name to "A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules From the Centre of the Ultraworld". After the first week of sale Minnie Ripertons record company forced Big Life to remove her voice from the song. After the first week another singer sang the song. 

The Orbs version of the song was 19 minutes long and became number 78 on the UK Singles Chart.

Hermann Carl Vogel

Hermann Carl Vogel (born April 3 1841, died August 13 1907) was a German astronomer. He was born in Leipzig, Kingdom of Saxony.

Vogel was one of the first astronomers to use a spectroscope in astronomy. He used it to read the chemicals on planets far away and to measure the time it takes the Sun to spin. He could read it by measuring the Doppler effect.

In 1882, Vogel became the Director at the Astrophysical Observatory Potsdam and he is best known for some work there in 1890. Vogel found that the colour of some stars changed over time, becoming red and then later becoming blue. His idea was that the star was moving toward and then away from the Earth, and that the colour changes were the because of that movement. These stars seemed to be orbiting around a hidden star as if they were double-stars but the second star could never be seen, only known by the colour changing Doppler effect.

Volgel proved that Algol was a double star that could not be seen (spectroscopic binary star) and it was one of the first of these double stars proven to exist.

Bop It

Bop It is an electronic game made by Hasbro. It was first appeared in 1996 when the very first Bop It was made. The aim of the game is to test the players reflexes by calling out commands in random order. Bop It is still made today and it is still a very popular toy. 
In 1996, Hasbro copyrighted the instructions to a handheld game called Bop It. The game features 3 different commands which were nicknamed Bop It (which is a central button), Twist It (a twistable lever) and a pull it (a cyan handle). The game had three different game modes and the maximum score was 100. The score was reported by using different sounds. If the player scored 99 or greater, a victory celebration would be sounded.

In 1998, Hasbro copyrighted the instructions to the Bop It Extreme. The game had the same inputs from the Original Bop It but had 2 additional inputs, Flick It and Spin It. The maximum score was increased to 250 and if the player scored over 150, a victory celebration would be played. At 250, it would trigger a different victory celebration.

In 2002, Hasbro copyrighted the instructions to the Bop It Extreme 2. This game featured an additional one on one mode and the score reporting in Solo was changed to using numbers.

As described in its instruction manual (copyright 2004), Hasbro's Bratz-themed "Bop It" game uses a layout like the Original Bop It. The maximum score in "Bratz Bop It" was 200. After 100 points, the victory celebration will play after reporting the score.

In 2005 Hasbro copyrighted the instructions to the "Bop It Blast", describing it as covered under the original (3-input) "Bop It" patent and referencing other patents that were pending. This newest member of the series again increased the maximum score to a total of 500, and for the first time allowed different high scores for different modes rather than having one high score for all modes collectively. Minor vocal additions were implemented such as the announcement of the player's score at notable landmarks (each 100 points scored). In addition to the five modes featured in "Bop It Extreme 2", a "Light Bop" mode was added. The game also had an optional female voice. The game can allow the player to select a male, a female or both voices calling the commands. The same victory celeration from the original bop it was used to report the 500 highest score. This device requires 3 AA batteries to operate.

In 2006, Hasbro made the instructions for the "Bop It Download"'. Software can be downloaded from http://www.playbopit.com which allows users to record their own voice, upload beats and sounds. Hasbro also made different accent voices. "Bop It Download" has a maximum score of 1000 and 15 difficulty levels. It includes the ability to download beats, and sounds.

In 2008, Hasbro made the instructions for the "Bop It!". At the 2009 London Toy Fair, Hasbro demonstrated "Bop It!". "Bop It!" has a new optional input, "Shout It," which requires a player to shout into the microphone. The "Bop It!" has three difficulty levels with "Novice" using only voice commands, "Expert" using a random mix of voice and sound commands, and "Master" calling out voice, sound, and color commands. If the player scores 100 points in either of the less difficult modes, the next most difficult mode is unlocked. Players that achieve a score of 100 points in "Master" mode are considered to have beaten the game. Hasbro also added a multiplayer game called "Party" where all the "Bop It" commands are replaced with body parts. .

In 2009, Hasbro made a completely different Bop It game and called it Bop-It! Bounce. It has six different games and it comes with an electronic trampoline and a ball.

In 2010, Hasbro made the next Bop It game called "Bop It XT". It was demonstrated at the UK Toy Fair in 2011 and it is to be released by the end of July. This model is similar in appearance to "Bop It Extreme" however it also features the new "Shake It" command. The game will have four difficulty levels and the same game modes as "Bop It!". Info about Bop It XT</ref> As with "Bop It Extreme 2", a headphone socket has been added to allow players to play using headphones or a loudspeaker.

In 2009, EA Games made a video game called Hasbro Family Games Night 2 which had Bop It as one of the games that could be played. It is available for the Nintendo DS and the Nintendo Wii.

In 2011, EA Games made an iPhone application which played exactly like the handheld game. It has the same commands from the handheld games and added extra commands which were never invented on the handheld game.

Shamanism is the name for a number of religious movements. Originally, it was used by Europeans to describe different religious and magical movements they could observe with certain indigenous people in Siberia, from about the 17th century. In the 20th century, the word was also used to describe other, similar movements worldwide.

Shamans play a central role in these movements, as they can be in both worlds, this one, and the world of spirits.


Shamanism is different from animism. Unlike this kind of religion, it is not an organised movement.

A real-time operating system (RTOS; commonly pronounced as "are-toss") is a multitasking operating system designed for real-time applications. Such applications include embedded systems, industrial robots, scientific research equipment and others.

An RTOS simplifies the creation of a real-time applications, but does not guarantee the final result will be real-time; this requires good development of the software. 

Real-time operating systems use specialized scheduling algorithms in order to provide the real-time applications. An RTOS can respond more quickly and/or predictably to an event than other operating systems. 

The main features of an RTOS are minimal interrupt latency and a minimal thread switching latency.

Complex instruction set computer

A complex instruction set computer (acronym CISC pronounced "sisk"), represents a CPU design method in which each instructions can execute several low-level operations, such as a load from memory, an arithmetic operation, and a memory store, all in a single instruction. The term is used in contrast to reduced instruction set computer (RISC).

The terms RISC and CISC have become less meaningful with the continued improvements of both CISC and RISC designs and implementations. The first highly pipelined "CISC" implementations, such as Intel 80486 series, supports every instruction that their predecessors did, but achieved "high efficiency" only on a few simple x86 subset (similar to a RISC instruction set, but without the "load-store" limitations of RISC). Modern x86 processors also decode and split more complex instructions into a series of smaller internal "Micro-operations" which can thereby be executed in a pipelined (parallel) fashion, thus achieving high performance on a much larger subset of instructions.

Examples of CISC processors are the System/360 (excluding the 'scientific' Model 44), VAX, PDP-11, Motorola 68000 family, and Intel x86 architecture based processors.

Firmware

In computing, firmware is a computer program that is "embedded" in a hardware device, for example a microcontroller. It can also be provided on flash memory or as a binary image file that can be uploaded onto existing hardware by a user. Some firmware can also be modded or changed by some really ordinary computer users through curious tools.

As its name suggests, firmware is somewhere between hardware and software, neither too hard or soft. Like software, it is a computer program which is done by a microprocessor or a microcontroller. But it is also linked to a piece of hardware and has no meaning without it.

In the past, firmware was stored in ROMs but now it is stored in media that can be written to such as EEPROMs and Flashs.

Firmware in many machines such as routers can now be updated without the need for additional hardware, often by downloading a new version from web to update the device, using instructions provided by the device manufacturer.

The easiest firmware to update is usually the system boot-related firmware, such as the BIOS in PCs. Some devices, such as video adapters and modems, frequently rely on firmware that is loaded by the operating system device drivers, and thus is updated by the operating system not by the user. Some computer viruses and hackers use operating system firmware update facilities to damage the firmware. An electronic device is said to be "bricked" if it is unable to start due to firmware issues.

Tropical Storm Edouard (2008)

Tropical Storm Edouard was a tropical storm that formed in the Gulf of Mexico. A weather system became still in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico in early August. An area of low pressure formed along the shear line early on August 2, which slowly became stronger during the next day. It strengthened into Tropical Depression Five, and was named Tropical Storm Edouard on August 3. The tropical storm moved towards the west on August 4. It moved onto land on August 5 on the upper Texas coast, about 40 miles southwest of Port Arthur and moved west-northwest into inland Texas. Edouard died out over land and became a tropical depression late on August 5. The depression turned to the northwest, causing heavy rain in central Texas on August 6.

In preparations for the storm, emergency teams along the Louisiana and Texas coasts became active. The Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, started a disaster declaration for 17 counties in Texas that were in the possible path of the storm. He also activated around 1,200 National Guard troops, a 70 member rescue team, six helicopters, and a team that brings food and water to affected areas. About 200 buses became ready for use in San Antonio and Houston to help in evacuations. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal declared a statewide emergency. In Cameron Parish, Louisiana, the Office of Emergency Preparedness started a mandatory evacuation, and Sheriff's deputies put up roadblocks. In the Gulf of Mexico, the Shell Oil company removed about 40 workers from drilling locations. 

Storm surge from the storm reached at Freshwater Locks in Louisiana, and also reached at Rollover Pass in Texas. Heavy rain fell along the upper Texas coast. The highest rainfall in Jefferson county from Edouard was from a site along the East Bay Bayou at Jones and Allen. In the Houston, Texas area, of rain faell at the Baytown Emergency Management Center. In central Texas, a cluster of thunderstorms near the center of the storm on August 6 caused of rain near Hamilton, Texas. The strongest winds of at the caused loss of electric power and a few fallen trees.

Immunity Aware Programming

Immunity aware programming is a set of programming techniques used while writing firmware for an embedded system. It is used mainly to overcome random errors that can occur in the CPU program counter or register set, RAM or any other that can cause failure of the "victim" device. Such random errors may be caused by single event upsets, not enough power, or by strong electromagnetic signals transmitted by some other "source" device.

Most of these techniques apply to the software in the "victim" device to make it more reliable while few of these techniques apply to software in the "source" device to make it send out less unwanted noise. For these reasons Immunity aware programming is one kind of:

Discriminant

In algebra, the discriminant of a polynomial that is equal to zero with real or complex coefficients is a certain expression in these coefficients of the polynomial if and only if the polynomial has a multiple root (for example, a root with multiplicity greater than one) in the complex numbers.

Single event upset

A single event upset (SEU) is a change of state caused by a low-energy ions or electro-magnetic or nuclear radiation or any other kind of interferences that can reach (called ""strike"") a sensitive node in a micro-electronic device, such as in a microprocessor, semiconductor memory, or power transistors. The error in the device output or operation caused as a result of the strike is called an SEU or a soft error. The SEU itself is not considered permanent damage to the transistor's, circuits' or devices'.

Avril Lavigne

Avril Ramona Lavigne (born September 27, 1984) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, fashion designer, and actress. Lavigne was born in Belleville, Ontario. At age 17, she released her first album called "Let Go". "Let Go" reached number one on the UK and Australian album charts. Lavigne later released the albums "Under My Skin" in 2004, "The Best Damn Thing" in 2007, and "Goodbye Lullaby" in 2011. In 2004, she won a World Music Award for favorite pop/rock artist.

Lavigne has done various other things in addition to singing. For instance, in 2006, Lavigne voiced a character in the movie "Over the Hedge". Lavigne has also appeared in the 2006 movie "Fast Food Nation". She has a clothing line, Abbey Dawn, and has released three perfumes.

In February 2004, Lavigne began dating Canadian singer, Deryck Whibley, the lead singer/guitarist of pop punk band Sum 41. On June 27, 2005, Lavigne and Whibley became engaged.

The couple married in a Roman Catholic ceremony on July 15, 2006, at a private estate in Montecito, California. Lavigne wore a Vera Wang gown and carried pearl white Australian roses. The people who came were members of band Sum 41, Matthew Lavigne (Avril's older brother), and Sum 41's close friend Robb Dipple. Avril's younger sister Michelle Lavigne was one of Avril's bridesmaids. The song "Iris" by the Goo Goo Dolls was played as their wedding song. When asked if they were ready to have children, they said "not right now, but somewhere down the road." On September 17, 2009, Avril Lavigne announced that she and Whibley split up, and divorce papers would soon follow. In September 2009 Lavigne and Whibley were officially separated after two and a half years together. On October 9, 2009, Lavigne filed for divorce.

In 1999, Avril won a competition to sing with Shania Twain in Ottawa, Canada. She debuted when a recording artist saw her singing country songs in a book store.

In June 2002, Avril released her first album, "Let Go". It got to number one in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, and number two in the United States. Two months later, she won an award for the music video "Complicated", the first single from "Let Go". She had her first success with "Complicated", "Sk8er Boi" and the first two singles from "Let Go" both entered the top 10 in the music charts. The next February, she was nominated for five Grammy Awards, but won none. Thanks to the success of her first three singles, Complicated, Sk8er Boi and I'm With You, Lavigne, then a teenager, became the second artist in history to have three number 1 songs from a debut album on the "Billboard" Mainstream Top 40.

In May 2004, her second album, "Under My Skin" was released. After that, on "Total Request Live", she was rude to journalists after being asked for her opinions of the media. Other times she was violent. Lavigne and Matthew Gerrard also wrote the song "Breakaway", which became a hit for Kelly Clarkson. 

"Under My Skin", was released on 25 May 2004. It debuted at No. 1 in many countries, including Australia, Mexico, Canada, Japan, the UK, and the U.S. The album has sold more than 10 million copies. Lavigne wrote most of the album's tracks with Canadian singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk. Kreviazuk's husband, Our Lady Peace front man Raine Maida, co-produced the album. Butch Walker and Don Gilmore were the other producers. Lavigne went on the Live and By Surprise twenty-one city mall tour in the U.S. and Canada to promote the album. She was accompanied by her guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld. Each performance had live acoustic versions of the new songs. At the end of 2004, Lavigne went on her first world tour, the Bonez Tour. She had shows on almost every continent. The tour lasted for the entire 2005 year.

"Don't Tell Me", the first single off the album, went to No. 1 in Argentina and Mexico. It reached the top five in the UK and Canada and the top ten in Australia and Brazil. "My Happy Ending", the album's lead single, went to No. 1 in Mexico and the top five in the UK and Australia. In the U.S., it reached the top ten of the "Billboard" Hot 100 and went to No. 1 in the Mainstream Top 40. It became her fourth biggest hit there. The third single, "Nobody's Home", did not make the top 40 in the U.S., reaching No. 1 only in Mexico and Argentina. The fourth single from the album, "He Wasn't", reached top 40 positions in the UK and Australia and was not released in the U.S.

Lavigne won two World Music Awards in 2004 for "World's Best Pop/Rock Artist" and "World's Bestselling Canadian Artist". She received five Juno Award nominations in 2005 of which she won three, including "Artist of the Year". She won the award for "Favorite Female Singer" at the eighteenth annual Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards and was nominated in every MTV Award show shown around the world.

In April 2007, her third album, "The Best Damn Thing" was released. The album was the first to carry a parental advisory warning due to repeated use of swear words. Avril described the album as "fast, fun, young, bratty, aggressive, confident, cocky in a playful way ... all the good stuff." "Girlfriend", the first single from the album, got to number one in seven countries. She was sued because a different band already had a song called "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend." Avril sang in "Girlfriend": "I want to be your girlfriend". She then went on a world tour, known as "The Best Damn Tour".

A month after The Best Damn Tour was completed, Lavigne began recording in her home studio in November 2008 with the song "Black Star". It was written to promote her first fragrance also called "Black Star". By July 2009, she had recorded nine tracks of the new album. These songs included "Everybody Hurts" and "Darlin". Lavigne had written some of these songs when she was young. "Darlin" was written by her when she was 15 years old, and living in Napanee, Ontario. Lavigne said the album was about "life". She said that it was easy for her to do a "boy-bashing pop song," but it was different to write about something "that's really close to me, something I've been through." Other than the album's lead single, "What the Hell", Lavigne described the songs on "Goodbye Lullaby" as different from her earlier songs. She said she was older, so her music was not so pop-rock now.
In January 2010, when she was writing and recording for the new album, Lavigne worked with Disney. This was on clothing designs inspired by those in Tim Burton's feature film, "Alice in Wonderland". She asked the executives if she could write a song for the film. So, she wrote the song "Alice". It was played over the end credits. It was also included on the soundtrack, "Almost Alice".

On 28 February, Lavigne performed at the concert portion of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony. She sang "My Happy Ending" and "Girlfriend".

The release dates for "Goodbye Lullaby" and its lead single were pushed back many times. Lavigne explained these delays. She said, "I write my own music and, therefore, it takes me longer to put out records 'cause I have to live my life to get inspiration." She added that she had enough material for two records. In November, Lavigne said in "Maxim", that "Goodbye Lullaby" took two and a half years to complete. She said her record company had led to the delays. She added that the album had been completed for a year. "Goodbye Lullaby" was released on 8 March in the US. The lead single, "What the Hell", premiered on "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve" on 31 December.

Hannibal Lecter

Doctor Hannibal Lecter is a fictional serial killer. He is a character in books by the crime drama writer Thomas Harris. Several of these books have been made into movies.

Lecter is a cannibal, meaning that he eats people. He is also highly intelligent, so that he can talk to people in a way that makes them afraid or disturbed. He employs this unusual technique most famously in "The Silence of the Lambs", a novel featuring him that was made into a movie starring Anthony Hopkins as Lecter. The movie became very popular, and won many awards.

Lecter considers himself very cultured, and often kills people that he thinks are stupid, annoying, or rude. He is a sociopath, meaning that he feels no emotion for other people. Thus, he is able to do whatever suits him on a whim without feeling guilty. 


Thomas Harris first wrote about Lecter in his novel Red Dragon, which shows how Hannibal Lecter was caught by the FBI, and ends up using his intelligence to help the agent who caught him catch another killer named Francis Dolarhyde. Will Graham, the agent who caught Lecter, is at first very offended by Lecter's demeanor, but comes to appreciate his help when Lecter gives him insight into the way Dolarhyde's mind works. Dolarhyde believes that he is a god, and that he is unaffected by laws and rules. He was played by Ralph Fiennes in the movie which was based on the book. Anthony Hopkins played Hannibal Lecter.

Another movie, "Manhunter", was based on this book and starred Tom Noonan as Dolarhyde and Brian Cox as Hannibal Lecter.

Lecter returned in "The Silence of the Lambs", the sequel to Red Dragon. The movie based on this book became very popular. The book is about an FBI agent named Clarice Starling (played by Jodie Foster in the film), who, like Will Graham from Red Dragon, is trying to catch a serial killer, who calls himself "Buffalo Bill" because he skins his victims like buffalo. Starling makes a deal with Lecter in which she will try to get him transferred to another prison (Lecter hates his cell) if he will help her understand Buffalo Bill's mind. In the end, Starling catches Bill, but Lecter escapes from prison, fleeing to Italy.

Harris' next novel was "Hannibal". It was a sequel to "Silence of the Lambs". The book told the story about what happened to Hannibal Lecter after he escaped from prison. Lector was hiding in Italy. He used a false name and driver's license so he would not be caught. The book is about a victim of his, named Mason Verger. Verger survived when Lecter tried to eat his face. He now wants to get revenge on Lector. Mason Verger captures Lecter. He tries to kill him with attack hogs, but Lecter escapes. Lecter was again played by Hopkins in the 2001 movie.

The final book in the series was "Hannibal Rising". It shows Lecter as a child. It tries to explain why he is a murderous cannibal. The critics did not like "Hannibal Rising" as much as they liked the first three books. This was mainly because people thought that the was unrealistic. They also felt it was not true to the characters. Thomas Harris has said in many interviews that he only wrote the book because he was afraid that someone else would write a book about Lecter as a child. 

The character of Hannibal Lecter has become very popular in American culture. This is mainly because he is so scary. Lecter is often thought to be one of the best movie villains of all time, next to Freddy Krueger and Norman Bates. AFI listed him at #1 on their list "Top 50 Movie Villains of All Time"

Predestination

Predestination is a religious concept, which is about the relationship between God and His creation. The religious character of predestination distinguishes it from other ideas about determinism and free will. Those who believe in predestination, such as John Calvin, believe that before the creation God determined the fate of the universe throughout all of time and space. They believe that God orders some people to Heaven and all other people to Hell before they even are born.

Predestination: The Divine foreordaining or foreknowledge of all that will happen; with regard to the salvation of some and not others. It has been particularly associated with the teachings of St. Augustine of Hippo and of John Calvin.

In Hinduism, which consists of four schools, predestination does not play an important role, as most followers believe in karma, associated with free will. However, in the Dvaita school of Vaishnavism, the philosopher Madhvacharya believed in a similar concept.

"Ended: 8 November 2008" 

I'm nominating for bureaucratship. Having been on this wiki from 2006, Majorly has made around 3125 edits, and is highly active and available for comments, questions and assistance. With only three highly active bureaucrats in place, editing at similar times during the day, there can be no harm in adding someone to this group. As far as experience goes, Majorly has administrator and bureaucrat access on meta-wiki, and is a former long-serving administrator on the English Wikipedia. It is therefore my pleasure to present Majorly for this role, and I hope the community will agree with this assessment. () 14:49, 31 October 2008 (UTC)

"Candidate's acceptance:" I accept. Thank you for nominating. 14:55, 31 October 2008 (UTC)




I've decided that if this fails, I'll be nominating another person for bureaucrat instead. We "do" need more bcrats, and even if people don't want me as one, perhaps someone else should do it instead. Two simply don't have this place covered. 10:37, 3 November 2008 (UTC)

It seems to me as 19 supports and 11 opposes as there is an ip adress vote and snickers' account was created after the vote started. () 21:09, 7 November 2008 (UTC)

As I said on Eptalon's talk page, I'd appreciate if this was closed with a little more thought than just looking at numbers. If I am made a bureaucrat, I shall of course be open to recall if anyone takes issue with my actions, and if I find myself not very active, I'll resign the bit. 16:10, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

<doc id="138894" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=138894" title="Gladiolus">
Gladiolus

Gladiolus (from Latin, the diminutive of "gladius", a sword) is a genus of flowering plants in the iris family (Iridaceae). Sometimes called the sword lily, the most widely-used English common name for these plants is simply gladiolus (plural gladioli, gladioluses or sometimes gladiolas).

The genus "Gladiolus" contains about 260 species, of which 250 are native to sub-Saharan Africa, mostly South Africa. About 10 species are native to Eurasia. There are 160 species of "Gladiolus" endemic in southern Africa and 76 in tropical Africa. The species vary from very small to the spectacular giant flower spikes in commerce.

These attractive, perennial herbs are semihardy in temperate climates. They grow from rounded, symmetrical corms, that are enveloped in several layers of brownish, fibrous tunics.

Their stems are generally unbranched, producing 1 to 9 narrow, sword-shaped, longitudinal grooved leaves, enclosed in a sheath. The lowest leaf is shortened to a cataphyll. The leaf blades can be plane or cruciform in cross section.

The fragrant flower spikes are large and one-sided, with secund, bisexual flowers, each subtended by 2 leathery, green bracts. The sepals and the petals are almost identical in appearance, and are termed tepals. They are united at their base into a tube-shaped structure. The dorsal tepal is the largest, arching over the three stamens. The outer three tepals are narrower. The perianth is funnel-shaped, with the stamens attached to its base. The style has three filiform, spoon-shaped branches, each expanding towards the apex.

The ovary is 3-locular with oblong or globose capsules, containing many, winged brown, longitudinally dehiscent seeds. In their center must be noticeable the specific pellet like structure which is the real seed without the fine coat. In some seeds this structure is wrinkled and with black color. These seeds are unable to germinate.

These flowers are variously colored, pink to reddish or light purple with white, contrasting markings, or white to cream or orange to red. 

The South African species were originally pollinated by long-tongued anthrophorine bees, but some changes in the pollination system have occurred, allowing pollination by sunbirds, noctuid and sphingid moths, long-tongued flies and several others. In the temperate zones of Europe many of the hybrid large flowering sorts of gladiolas can be pollinated by small well-known wasps. Actually, They are not very good pollinators because of the large flowers of the plants and the small size of the wasps. Another insect in this zone which can try some of the nectar of the gladioli is the best-known European Hawk-moth "Macroglossum stellatarum" which usually pollinates many famous garden flowers like "Petunia", "Zinnia", "Dianthus" and others.

Gladioli are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Large Yellow Underwing.

Feathertail Glider

The Feathertail Glider ("Acrobates pygmaeus"), also known as the Pygmy Gliding Possum, Pygmy Glider, Pygmy Phalanger and Flying Mouse, is the world's smallest gliding mammal, and is named for its long feather-shaped tail. Although only the size of a very small mouse (65 to 80 mm and 10 to 14 g), it can leap and glide long distances from tree to tree, up to 25 metres. Like other gliding mammals, the Feathertail Glider has a skin membrane between the fore and hind legs; thicker than that of the other marsupials like the Sugar Glider, but smaller in proportion, extending only between the elbows and knees.

Sugar Glider

The Sugar Glider ("Petaurus breviceps") is a small marsupial originally native to eastern and northern mainland Australia, New Guinea, and the Bismarck Archipelago, and introduced to Tasmania.

Around the world, the sugar glider is a popular domestic pet. It is one of the most commonly traded wild animals in the illegal pet trade, where animals are plucked directly from their natural habitats. 

In Australia, sugar gliders can be kept in Victoria, South Australia and the Northern Territory but not Western Australia, New South Wales, ACT or Tasmania.

Sugar gliders are most popular as pets in the United States, where they are bred in large numbers. Most states and cities allow sugar gliders as pets, with some exceptions.

<doc id="138927" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=138927" title="Bismarck Archipelago">
Bismarck Archipelago

The Bismarck Archipelago is a group of islands off the northeastern coast of New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean and part of Papua New Guinea.

The first inhabitants of the Archipelago arrived around 33,000 years ago after sailing from what is now Papua New Guinea. Later arrivals included the Lapita people.

The first European to visit these islands was Dutch explorer Willem Schouten in 1616. 

The islands remained unsettled by western Europeans until they became part of the German protectorate of German New Guinea in 1884. The area was named in honor of the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck.

On 13 March 1888, a volcano erupted on Ritter Island causing a megatsunami. Almost 100% of the volcano fell in to the ocean leaving a small crater lake.

Following the outbreak of World War I, the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force seized the islands in 1914 and Australia later received a League of Nations mandate for the islands. They remained under Australian control — interrupted only by Japanese occupation during World War II — until Papua New Guinea became independent in 1975.

Legal precedent

In common law legal systems, a precedent or authority is a legal case establishing a principle or rule that a court or other judicial body adopts when deciding later cases with similar issues or facts. 

The precedent on an issue is the collective body of judicially announced principles that a court should consider when interpreting the law. When a precedent establishes an important legal principle, or represents new or changed law on a particular issue, that precedent is often known as a landmark decision.

Precedent is central to legal analysis and rulings in countries that follow common law like the United Kingdom and Canada (except Quebec). In some systems precedent is not binding but is taken into account by the courts.

Precedent that must be applied or followed is known as "binding precedent" (alternately "mandatory precedent", "mandatory" or "binding authority", etc.). Under the doctrine of "stare decisis", a lower court must honor findings of law made by a higher court that is within the appeals path of cases the court hears. In the United States state and federal courts, jurisdiction is often divided geographically among local trial courts, several of which fall under the territory of a regional appeals court, and all regional courts fall under a supreme court. By definition decisions of lower courts are not binding on each other or any courts higher in the system, nor are appeals court decisions binding on each other or on local courts that fall under a different appeals court. Further, courts must follow their own proclamations of law made earlier on other cases, and honor rulings made by other courts in disputes among the parties before them pertaining to the same pattern of facts or events, unless they have a strong reason to change these rulings.

One law professor has described mandatory precedent as follows:

In extraordinary circumstances a higher court may overturn or overrule mandatory precedent, but will often attempt to distinguish the precedent before overturning it, thereby limiting the scope of the precedent in any event.

Precedent that is not mandatory but which is useful or relevant is known as "persuasive precedent" (or "persuasive authority" or "advisory precedent"). Persuasive precedent includes cases decided by lower courts, by peer or higher courts from other geographic jurisdictions, cases made in other parallel systems (for example, military courts, administrative courts, indigenous/tribal courts, State courts versus Federal courts in the United States), and in some exceptional circumstances, cases of other nations, treaties, world judicial bodies, etc.

In a case of first impression, courts often rely on persuasive precedent from courts in other jurisdictions that have previously dealt with similar issues. Persuasive precedent may become binding through the adoption of the persuasive precedent by a higher court.

Long-held custom, which has traditionally been recognized by courts and judges, is the first kind of precedent. Custom can be so deeply entrenched in the society at large that it gains the force of law. There need never have been a specific case decided on the same or similar issues in order for a court to take notice of customary or traditional precedent in its deliberations.

The other type of precedent is case law. In common law systems this type of precedent is granted more or less weight in the deliberations of a court according to a number of factors. Most important is whether the precedent is "on point," that is, does it deal with a circumstance identical or very similar to the circumstance in the instant case? Second, when and where was the precedent decided? A recent decision in the same jurisdiction as the instant case will be given great weight. Next in descending order would be recent precedent in jurisdictions whose law is the same as local law. Least weight would be given to precedent that stems from dissimilar circumstances, older cases that have since been contradicted, or cases in jurisdictions that have dissimilar law.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has stated:

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stated:

Precedents viewed against passing time can serve to establish trends, thus indicating the next logical step in evolving interpretations of the law. For instance, if immigration has become more and more restricted under the law, then the next legal decision on that subject may serve to restrict it further still.

Scholars have recently attempted to apply network theory to precedents in order to establish which precedents are most important or authoritative, and how the court's interpretations and priorities have changed over time.
Super-stare decisis is a term used for important precedent that is resistant or immune from being overturned, without regard to whether correctly decided in the first place. It may be viewed as one extreme in a range of precedential power, or alternately, to express a belief, or a critique of that belief, that some decisions should not be overturned.

In 1976, Richard Posner and William Landes coined the term "super-precedent," in an article they wrote about testing theories of precedent by counting citations. Posner and Landes used this term to describe the influential effect of a cited decision. The term "super-precedent" later became associated with different issue: the difficulty of overturning a decision. In 1992, Rutgers professor Earl Maltz criticized the Supreme Court's decision in "Planned Parenthood v. Casey" for endorsing the idea that if one side can take control of the Court on an issue of major national importance (as in "Roe v. Wade"), that side can protect its position from being reversed "by a kind of super-stare decisis." 

The issue arose anew in the questioning of Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito during their confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Before the hearings the chair of the committee, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, wrote an op/ed in the "New York Times" referring to "Roe" as a "super-precedent." He mentioned the concept (and made seemingly humorous references to "super-duper precedent") during the hearings, but neither Roberts nor Alito endorsed the term or the concept. 

In a controversial 1997 book, attorney Michael Trotter blamed over-reliance by American lawyers on binding and persuasive authority, rather than the merits of the case at hand, as a major factor behind the escalation of legal costs during the 20th century. He argued that courts should ban the citation of persuasive precedent from outside their jurisdiction, with two exceptions:

Westminster Under School is a private preparatory school for boys aged 7 to 13 and is part of Westminster School in London.

The school was founded in 1943 in the buildings of Westminster School in Little Dean’s Yard, just behind Westminster Abbey. In 1951 the Under School relocated to its own site in Eccleston Square. Due to rising numbers of pupils in the 1960s and 1970s, the school moved again in 1981 to its present site (which was a former hospital) next the Westminster School playing fields in Vincent Square. There are 267 pupils attending the school. The school has a strong musical tradition and provides choristers for St Margaret's Church, London. 
Most boys attending the school move on to Westminster School after the completion of either Common Entrance or Scholarship examinations (The Challenge), although a number of boys each year go onto other schools, most often either Eton or Harrow. 

The Master is Mr J. P. Edwards; the Deputy Master is Mr D. Bratt. There are currently 39 members of staff.

The school fees for 2008-9 are £4412 pre term.

Furby

A Furby (plural Furbys or Furbies, according to Tiger. Co.) is a popular electronic toy or robot, more specifically, a hamster/owl-like creature made by Tiger Electronics, which went through a time of being the "must-have" toy following its launch in the winter holiday season of 1998, with continuing sales until 2000. Furbies sold 1.8 million units in 1998, 14 million units in 1999, and altogether in its three years of original production, Furby sold over 40 million units, and its speaking capabilities were translated into 24 languages. A video game of the Furbies was released in 1998 by Hasbro Interactive with many activities. Furbies were the first successful attempt to produce and sell a programed robot. In 2005, new Furbies were released, with voice-recognition and more complex facial movements, among many other changes and improvements. There was a common mistake that they repeated words that were said around them. This belief most likely came from the fact that it is possible to have the Furby say certain pre-programmed words or phrases more often by petting it whenever it said these words. As a result of this myth, several intelligence agencies banned them from their offices.

David Hampton and Caleb Chung created the Furby in about nine months (in addition to an additional nine months spent designing the toy). That was the amount of time between Tiger Electronics showing an interest in his interactive creatures, during which Roger Schiffman bought the rights to it, and the time they hit store shelves. Furby's first public appearance was at the International Toy Fair in 1998. Furbys originally retailed for about US$35, and upon release Furbys flew off the shelves in toyshops. The demand for these toys during the 1998 holiday season drove the resale price over US$100 and sometimes as high as several hundred dollars. Furbies sold for over US$300 in newspapers and in auctions. Nicknames were given to them, and sellers gave values to them. Some people continue to call their Furbies by the terms 'wedding Furby', 'tuxedo Furby', 'snowball Furby', 'biker Furby', and others. All, of course, were named rare by sellers, because they were so hard to find at the time. In a sure display of the demand for even one Furby, some sellers at the time scammed people out of a lot of money, without even having first given them a Furby. Parent battles, arguments, and fights grew higher at the popularity of them, and when retail supplies ran out, parents turned to the Internet, where Furbies could be purchased for two, three, or more multiples of their retail price. This action led to many parents ending up on eBay.

In 2005 Furbies were re-introduced with the release of the new Emoto-Tronic Furby. The highly growing emotional realism of the Emoto-Tronic Furby has given birth to a number of Furby-like special interest groups. These communities want to bring features of the Furby experience into human society. The most visible of these groups include Furbish-to-English translators and Furby adoption agencies. 

The original Furbies were 6 inches (15 cm) tall. The main reason for their popularity was because of apparent "intelligence", reflected in their ability to develop language skills. Furbies can communicate with one another via an infrared port located between their eyes. 
A simple electric motor and a system of camras and gears close the Furby's eyes and mouth, raise its ears, and lift it off the ground in a "faux" display of mobility. The originals are still popular with many hackers as they can be dissected and made or changed to do other interesting things, including being able to say something insluting or humorous, like "Shut up". In particular, they can be to do things their advanced audio capabilities and various sensory interfaces make them popular with the circuit bending community.

In 1999, the Furby Babies line was introduced. Furby Babies are smaller than the original, have higher voices, and cannot dance, but switch to speaking English more quickly. They also have bigger vocabulary, and different "Easter Eggs" and "games" built into them. Baby furbies come in 24 different colors. All with white eye lashes, six different eyecolors.

Book Furbies were also released, including an interactive Furby-like Gizmo, from the movie Gremlins, a Furby-like Interactive Yoda based on the Star Wars character, and a Furby-like Interactive E.T. from the movie of the same name. Another 'friend of furby', called Shelby, is similar to Furby, but looks like a clam, has lots of improvement in memory, and has a different personality; it was released in 2001 and can communicate with the original Furbies and Furby Babies. They also have sensors that can sense loud sounds, they can sense being upside down (they say things like "Shiver me timbers" and "Walk the plank", in the style of a pirate ship captain, when you leave them upside-down for a long period of time), and they laugh when you "tickle" them (their antennae - or "tennies", as they like to call them). They also purr when you "pet" them. You can feed them by sticking your finger in their mouth. Similarly, Shelbys do not have their own names, unlike the classic Furbies. Shelbys are also capable of knowing if it is talking to a Furby or another Shelby, saying phrases such as "Where's Furby?" - though they cannot tell the difference between a Furby and a Furby Baby - they just think it's a Furby. In addition to English, Shelbys also know some Furbish words and also have their own language called "Shelbish."

The latest kinds of Furby were released in August 2005. Larger than the other ones, the new Furbies have been upgraded with a more emotional face and a voice recognition system, letting them communicate with humans. Unlike the Furbies originally released, just one order is necessary to make them 'sleep', and they have an off switch. They can communicate with other types of Emoto-tronic Furbies, though to a smaller amont than the communication between original Furbies, and they cannot themselves communicate with the original Furbies. They also do not have light sensors and basic motion sensors. These Furbies, according to the story they come packed with, are from Furby Island.

In 2006, a new version of Furby baby was released, with most notable features being the new look and a more "Baby-ish" appearance in contrast to the Emoto-Tronic Furby adult. They also have considerably less features than the "adult" Furby, with a very limited vocabulary and a lower level of interactivity. Another notable feature of the 2006 Emoto-Tronic Baby Furby is the movable "legs", which unfurl when Furby baby is awakened.

The Funky Furby was released in August 2006 outside the US. They are limited to two color combinations (pink & yellow and purple & green) so far, and can sing three new songs and dance. They can be taught dance styles and remember them.

Furbish is the language which is spoken by the Furbies. It is similar to English with a different grammar structure. A newly bought Furby starts out speaking entirely Furbish, the unique language with short words, simple syllables, and various other sounds, that all Furbies use, but are programmed to speak less Furbish as they learn more English as they "grow". Throughout a Furby's lifetime, it gradually learns English words and phrases, which it begins to speak in place of Furbish. The more English they learn, the more they "grow", making them more muture. The Furbish phrase "WHOA! Me deep sleep!" would translate into English as "Whoa! I slept for a long time!"

These are common Furbish pharses.

Furbies may say these Furbish words:

God in Christianity

In Christianity, one way people think of God is as a being that made everything and lives forever. The Christian Bible speaks of God as one who is, who speaks, who sees, hears, acts, and loves. Christians believe that God has a will and is a kind, all powerful being.

Some Christians believe God to be immanent (with and inside all things). Others believe he will be immanent later. Most believe he is also transcendent (outside space and time, so he is unable to be changed by forces inside the universe).

Trinitarians see the Christian God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They say that God is one being that lives forever, who is inside and beyond nature. All Christian denominations say that God is personal to humans and to himself. Most Christians believe that God is a spirit.

In the Bible, God has the personal name Yahweh (or YHWH).

God is not seen often by people in the Bible.

Churro

Churros, sometimes called Spanish doughnuts, are fried-dough pastry-based snacks, sometimes made from potato dough, that originated in Spain. They are popular in Latin America, France, Portugal, the United States, and Spanish-speaking Caribbean islands. There are two types of churros in Spain. One is long and fat, and the other, extra popular in Madrid, is thin and has knots ("porra"). They are both eaten for breakfast and with chocolate.

The Lion King II: Simba's Pride

The Lion King II: Simba's Pride is an American direct-to-video movie released by Walt Disney Pictures on October 27, 1998 and the sequel to "The Lion King". It is about Simba and Nala's cub, Kiara, who meets a cub named Kovo. Like how the first movie seems to have been based on the Shakespeare play "Hamlet", this movie is similar to another Shakespeare play, "Romeo and Juliet". It was later retitled The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride when it was re-released as a special edition DVD on August 31, 2004. In 1998, Disney believed that "Simba's Pride" would be so popular that it shipped 15 million copies to stores for the October 27 release date. Disney sold 3.5 million copies in three days. Thirteen million copies were sold while it was still in print in the late 90s. In 2004, another sequel was released, a part prequel-part midquel (called an "in between-quel" by its teaser trailer), "The Lion King 1½".

Simba and Nala have a daughter, Kiara. Timon and Pumbaa are assigned to be her babysitters, but she easily escapes their care and ventures into the forbidden lands. There she meets a lion cub named Kovu and they become friends. What she and her parents do not know is that Kovu is the son of Zira - a banished follower of the now-dead Scar. She plans to raise Kovu to overthrow Simba and become the king of the Pride Lands. This tests not only Kiara and Kovu's relationship as they mature, but Simba's relationship with his daughter. 

Singing voices

An audio CD entitled "Return to Pride Rock: Songs Inspired by Disney's The Lion King II: Simba's Pride" was released in 1999. Although not promoted as a soundtrack to the movie, it contained all the songs from the movie and some additional songs inspired by it by Lebo M. The complete track list of the CD:
(A * indicates songs inspired by the movie)

On August 31, 2004, Disney released an "enhanced soundtrack" to coincide with the movie's 2-Disc Special Edition DVD. However the CD contained everything from the "Return to Pride Rock" CD except the "inspired songs".

The Lion King 1½

The Lion King 1½ (also known as The Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata in some countries) is the prequel to The Lion King made by The Walt Disney Company. The movie focuses on the characters Timon and Pumbaa before they met Simba. This feature was released on DVD and video on February 10, 2004. 

Timon and Pumbaa start to watch the original Lion King movie, but Timon keeps insisting to fast forward to when they come in, because they weren't seen in the beginning of the story or anywhere until halfway through. Pumbaa suggests telling the audience their story, which begins before Simba's journey begins. Through this, we meet Timon's mother and Uncle Max, discover why he left his meerkat colony, where he learned Hakuna Matata, how he meets Pumbaa, and the perils they encountered while searching for their dream home.

The film soundtrack, "The Lion King 1½: Songs From Timon and Pumbaa's Hilarious Adventure", was released to CD by Disney Records on February 10, 2004. It includes two songs from the original film, "That's All I Need" and "Hakuna Matata", reperformed by Nathan Lane who took over the role of voicing the character Timon. The rest of the soundtrack includes various R&B tracks, including remakes of the Kool and the Gang classic "Jungle Boogie" by artist French, and two instrumental pieces from film composer Don Harper.


A video game version of the movie was released for the Game Boy Advance system. It was published by THQ under license from Disney Interactive, and developed by Vicarious Visions.

Animatronics

Animatronics is to use electronics and robotics in automated, magically moving puppets to make them appear to be alive. It is normally used in moviemaking, but also in theme parks and other forms of getting out of boredom. The best things about it and CGI and stop motion is that it is not a feeling of reality, but are some objects moving in the computer. The technology behind this has become more large and difficult over the years, making the puppets become real.

I've added the "Did you know" section on the Main Page, along with the first batch of DYKs. Thank you to all who helped accomplish this! I'll be around to check if everything is alright with DYK and if the formatting is correct. Planned hooks to be updated to the Main Page should be added to so editors can look over them before it actually becomes visible on the actual Main Page on . I realize maybe only a few editors here have experience with DYKs, and since I generally have the most experience (I've been "actively" involved with DYK for about half a year), I'll try to look over how things are going often. I'll tend to check often also to make sure moved hooks don't have any problems such as having related hooks next to each other, formatting, consistency, etc. Again, thank you to all who helped with DYK! I'm sure our new addition to the Main Page will attract more readers to come by and maybe even contribute more often. – () 04:25, 23 October 2008 (UTC)

Hello there,

I think that it would perhaps be good to change the way schools /school users contribute to wikipedia. I think the following would be doable:


That way, we should be able to no longer run into cases like Kambly (and Emile Bloch SA, which I have not restored; company is about half the size of Kambly)

Comments? -- () 15:53, 23 October 2008 (UTC)

OK, so BlueGoblin7 has got his DYK proposal up and running, so I reckon I might have more chance this time. Here's to my "Tip of the Day" proposal, as a replacement of . Input? Microchip • 19:20, 23 October 2008 (UTC)

hi all, i find some articles require necessary hard words, nouns usually, for which translation would be hard and misleading. </br>
ex. skiing and the word 'mogul' or Guitar and 'fret'.

i propose a new template that would list the necessary difficult words in a small box of somesort.
something like ? </br>
with each word linking to simple wiktionary? </br>
i dont know the procedure for creating such a thing. 

good/bad idea? is it difficult to make?-- cheers. () 20:04, 23 October 2008 (UTC)

Maybe it will be easier if you make a Hard Words section at the bottom of the article where you can explain the hard words. If you make piped links like <nowiki>the hard word</nowiki> to the Hard Words section you can click on a word you don't know and jump down to the bottom and read what it means, and then you use Backspace or the browser Back button to jump back up where you were reading. Try it. Or else you can use a star or something, like <nowiki>*</nowiki> NEXT to the hard word* (<--Try it) so you can still link the hard word to another article. I used the "Disambiguation" section on this page for an example because there is no "Hard Words" section to jump to. () 20:27, 30 October 2008 (UTC)

Is this really necessary? Things like isn't a good idea, IMO. – () 05:56, 24 October 2008 (UTC)
note all projects on this 5 year old wiki are on user space since permanently... ~ .. 06:20, 24 October 2008 (UTC)
Its quite straightforward to move the established projects off the user pages as proof you are not stagnant at least ~ ..
I'm sorry Ryan but you cant have your (that is taken fron en.wiki) ~ .. 06:28, 24 October 2008 (UTC)
Obviously, Ryan, a regime of no concensus has been produced. Look at the lack of input in the vote about the video games project above. None of the members entered an opinion and several were active. I made efforts to show the existance of the video game project. To seek prevention of this is questionable at least. Why on earth should I not display the existance of the project? I should keep it to myself only to be found by accident? I cannot show people without displaying it and neither can you. What do you, or anyone else, propose as a possibility of gaining interest in a project? You are promoting the closure of sections. Look into ways to help instead please (such as supporting the project or leaving it as a non project person!! again show some support please!!) Dont correct me until I do something that will not help the wiki, what do you say kiddo? ~ .. 07:05, 24 October 2008 (UTC)

I think quite strongly that these ads should not be used on talk pages - the ads are for userpages. The link you provided to enwiki did not show an ad, but a project banner. These are used to show the quality and importance of the article, as well as providing a link to the Wikiproject. However, this is not feasible on this Wikiproject as there would be an awful lot of articles to asses. The ads on the talk pages also looks messy, as they are not centred, and are on what is otherwise a blank page. I can understand a text link at the top of talk pages that already have comments on, but I do not like the ad.

Due to the size of this wiki, Wikiprojects come and go, and there might easily be a time within the next few years when there are no editors active on the video games Wikiproject - or at least not actively editing video game articles regularly. Then we have a load of links to an idle Wikiproject... The "community" decided not to use these for a reason, and seeing as this wiki is still not that much bigger, I think it should stay that way.

In reply to your (RTG) ""no concensus has been produced"" (about above vote): although you're right - not many people provided input - there are three opposes and only one support (from you). Some people may have not voted as they did not think it would pass as only one user appeared to be for the idea. Surely this conversation makes it clear that a consensus has now been reached with other users.

Another point I've just noticed is that the ad was made for enwiki and would need adapting to use here:

Sorry for the long and disjointed post - I thought of things as I wrote! And BTW Kennedy, "Stop making a mountain out of a bowling green." - I like that :). Thanks - 16:10, 24 October 2008 (UTC)

Hello. may help with suggesting DYK's. It is almost ready. There is a few points I need to iron out. But it works. So give it a try, and you will see what I mean. Also, any comments, or fixes to the coding is very much welcome! Regards, 08:46, 24 October 2008 (UTC)

As everyone might have seen today, RyanCross and I have just deleted 100+ pages that were tagged as G7 by a user who either:

5 hours ago, Creol did some mass deletion as well, but had the bot flag, so didn't cause much harm to Recent Changes. I feel that the whole deletion process will be much cleaner and neater if sysops on this wiki are able to set the flood flag on themselves (in case such a thing happens again). Any thoughts?     06:03, 25 October 2008 (UTC)

Hello, i put a complex tag on some time ago. I have now rewritten the page; please feel free to read and improve. I am posting this here since the page is considered policy. In general, we should look that none of our poicies or guidelines have a tag. 

What is the difference between "New user account" and "Account created automatically"? (and why is it a red link? I will fix that) ~ .. 09:31, 25 October 2008 (UTC)

Today on , some vandalism was done by a sock of . Steward ran a local checkuser to reveal that and were meatpuppets; one had asked the other to vandalise so the other could get adminship. Spacebirdy then locked both global accounts belonging to Bluegoblin7 and WashingManwithwings. Other socks were discovered on simple Wiktionary. This is posted to inform the community of these findings. () 23:17, 25 October 2008 (UTC)

(unindenting) After speaking with WashingManOnWings, I ran a few CheckUser requests. These are of course only valid for SEWP, as I do not have the priv anywhere else; Here are a few of my findings:
Given that at least one of the users has contributed here productively, it would in my opinion be appropriate to globally unlock their accounts, or to provide evidence that a global lock is indeed necessary. This would mean that the resp. projects could tackle the situation as they see fit, rather than having to abide by a global ban. These are of course just my findings.-- () 16:52, 26 October 2008 (UTC)

...is not a simple word. Could someone use a bot to change (disambiguation) to (different meanings) or similar? ~ .. 00:46, 26 October 2008 (UTC)
hmmm... its not on the list and certainly is complicated (I didnt know this word before reading wikipedia pages, I went to a good school) ~ .. 00:53, 26 October 2008 (UTC)
I learned latin at this school , and yes the word "ambi" was similar to the word "two" 2000 years ago, but in english "disambiguation" is roughly the most complicated word for that meaning and found only in text books (certainly beyond "simple english"). Anyway, perhaps it is not important. ~ .. 02:21, 26 October 2008 (UTC)

The conversation on my RfA has got me thinking. Is it really necessary to create the talk page of an article you have created, noting that it came from ENwiki? If it is in fact really necessary, then I've asked Bluegoblin to help. I'd much rather a bot or script to be used to create all of them, but I'd like to know what everyone else thinks before this takes place. Thoughts? 18:58, 28 October 2008 (UTC)

For the sake of it, lets just say its needed. Hypothetically, a bot or script could go by the date and time it was created, and reference it back to a copy of the en article, corresponding to that date and time. 19:49, 28 October 2008 (UTC)

Hello there, I write this in a new section, because I felt the break would visually make sense. Don't be afraid to disagree. First of all, I am not a loawyer, so basically I write about stuff I don't know much about (like so many others). For sipmlicity, I assume we have a GFDL without invariant sections; having one with invariants would make it possible to state the whole work was invariant (which in turn defeats the purpose of the GFDL). If this is the case, I think alineas 4.I and 4.J apply here. 

4.I basically says it is possible to carry along all the (change) history. This would point to importing the whole page, and then modifying it. As Creol stated above, because of technical limitations we get at most 100 versions; to me this basically says that we currently cannot fulfill this clause (-> import in its current form may be very nice, but does not meet GFDL)

4.J basically states that it is possible link back to an "online version" (which has all the history, as of 4.I). This is what the template does. The problem with this is that there is no 'one place' where there is all of the history, but two: EnWP, up to the version where we "created our derivative work" (i.e. copied the article), and the history page of the article on this wikipedia for local changes. If another language version uses our article, we will get three steps. In other words this is not sufficient either.

I therefore want to propose a procedure (that isn't GFDL-compliant either, but at least then we do it all in the same manner):


Even if you "forget" step 2, the article is attributed; it is easy to find the resp. article in EnWP. Since we don't give the exact revision, we do perhaps "overattribute", but we cannot help this.

And remember: I am a techie, interested in how to do it in practice. I leave the more "abstract thoughts" to the lawyers. -- () 13:09, 29 October 2008 (UTC)

I have returned full time from my wikibreak...I did some thinking and cleared my head and am now read to go. I shall get started tomorrow morning (cause it 2am here as I'm writing this) updating Wrestling articles. Talk to y'all soon. :D--  ✧   06:02, 30 October 2008 (UTC)

The above RfD is supposed to be closed today at around 11:00 (UTC). Since there is no consensus yet, can others participate in the RfD discussion? I'll probably leave the RfD open longer until consensus is reached. Thanks, – () 05:26, 31 October 2008 (UTC)

<doc id="139064" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=139064" title="Scar (The Lion King)">
Scar (The Lion King)

Scar is a fictional character and the main villain in Walt Disney Pictures' popular 1994 animated movie "The Lion King". Scar was voiced by Jeremy Irons with singing vocals by Jim Cummings. His supervising animator was Andreas Deja. Scar is one of four Disney characters to be nominated for "Best Villain" in the MTV Movie Awards (the other three being the White Witch, Captain Barbossa and Davy Jones), and is also the only Disney animated character to have achieved this. 

In the first movie, the animals go and see Simba. In the next scene, Scar is playing with a mouse telling it that "life's not fair, is it?". Mufasa is mad at Scar for not coming to see Simba. Scar tells Simba later on in the movie about the elephant graveyard and says "an elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince. Opps!". This is likely a poke at "Bambi", as in Bambi the main character is "the young prince". Simba takes his best friend Nala with him and have to go with Zazu the hornbill. Zazu talks about Simba and Nala getting "betroved" (meaning they are going to be married). This similar to Bambi as Bambi and Faline were supposed to be married and in Felx Salten's original book, "Bambi, A Life in the Woods", they were cousins. This is another controversy surrounding "The Lion King" as that other than Mufasa and Scar, there are no other grown male lions in the group, making Simba and Nala cousins. Simba sings a song to distract Zazu away from them, and Simba and Nala enter the elephant graveyard. They almost get killed by three hyenas, "Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed", who are friends with Scar. Mufasa comes just in time to save Simba and Nala from the hyenas, and Mufasa tells Simba about what he did wrong. Meanwhile, Scar tells Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed how he plans to get rid of Mufasa and Simba in a song called "Be Prepared". Scar then tells Simba to wait in the gorge for a "to die for" surprise. A huge stampede ensures, and Mufasa saves Simba in time, but does not make it in time to save himself from Scar. Scar flings Mufasa into the gorge, where he falls to his death, and tells Simba it was all his fault. He tells Simba to "run. Run away and never return." Then he sends the hyenas to go kill Simba, but he escapes. They shout threats at him, saying things like "if ya ever come back, we'll kill ya!". Scar tells the pride about the stampede, saying Simba died too. When Simba finally meets back with Nala, he finds out what Scar has done to the pridelands. Simba still thinks he's not who he used to be and that it was his fault Mufasa died and that Scar is the right king. But with some help from Rafiki ("friend" in the African language Swahili), he realizes that he must "take his place in the Circle of Life". Simba challenges Scar in an epic battle, and finds out that it was Scar who killed Mufasa. Scar blames everything on the hyenas, but Simba does not believe this. Simba finally defeats Scar where he falls of a cliff, something that happens in many Disney movies, and he says "ah! My friends!"
Shenzi says "friends? I thought he said we were the "enemy"!" Banzi agrees saying "yeah! That's what I heard." They both turn and say "Ed?". Ed laughs in agreement and Scar tries to explain but the hyenas attack him as a fire starts, and everything settles down. Simba reclaims his rightful place "in the Circle of Life", and the next spring everything is back and better than ever. The movie ends with Simba and Nala having a cub of their own.

Scar appears in "" in Simba's nightmare that is similar to the stampede sequence in the first movie. Mufasa is falling and Simba is trying to save him. But Scar tells Simba to trust him and let go. Mufasa falls and Simba is angry. Suddenly Scar turns into Kovu and throws Simba into the stampede. In "The Lion King II", the new villain Zira, has a group of lionesses that were loyal to him. Due to this, Simba has banished them to the Outlands. In another scene of "The Lion King II", Kovu is being banished and looks into a puddle of water and sees Scar's reflection instead of his own.

Scar appears a few times in "The Lion King 1½", without speaking. He last appears as he falls to his death.

Woolworths (Australia)

Woolworths is a group of Australian supermarkets. It is known by locals as 'Woolies'. It is the largest supermarket chain in Australia. 
As at October 2008 the business had 780 Australian supermarkets and 667 liquor stores in Australia. It owns 201 supermarkets in New Zealand. It also owns 271 hotels and the discount department store chain "Big W" and an electronics retail chain "Dick Smith".

Shops in Victoria used to be known as Safeway until 2008, when Woolworths Limited announced that all Safeway stores would become Woolworths stores in line with the rest of Australia. The New South Wales company had taken over the Victorian chain in the 1980s but had not changed the shop names (and in fact rebranded existing Woolworths stores as Safeway). In August 2008 there were 189 supermarkets in Victoria that were to be changed from being called "Safeway" to "Woolworths". One Victorian store is now Woolworths, that store is located at Chadstone Shopping Center.

Woolworths was the first Australian supermarket to offer petrol discounts when a certain amount of money was spent in the shop.

Woolworths has been taken to court by technology giant apple Apple Inc. because the woolworths logo looks like the apple logo

Bit-level parallelism

Bit-level parallelism is a form of parallel computing based on increasing processor word size, depending on very-large-scale integration (VLSI) technology. Enhancements in computers designs were done by increasing bit-level parallelism 

Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute in order to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than the length of the word. (For example, consider a case where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers. The processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer, then add the 8 higher-order bits, requiring two instructions to complete a single operation. A 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with single instruction) 

Historically, 4-bit microprocessors were replaced with 8-bit, then 16-bit, then 32-bit microprocessors, then 64-bit microprocessors. 32-bit processors has been a standard in general purpose computing for about 20 years, but now 64-bit processors are taking the lead.

<doc id="139139" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=139139" title="Instruction level parallelism">
Instruction level parallelism

Instruction-level parallelism (ILP) is a measure of how many operations in a computer program can be performed "in-parallel" at the same time (termed:""simultaneously""). Consider the following program:

Operation 3 depends on the results of "e" and "f" which are calculated from operations 1 and 2, so "g" cannot be calculated until both of "e" and "f" are computed. However, operations 1 and 2 do not depend on any other operation, so they can be computed simultaneously. If we assume that each operation can be completed in one unit of time then these three instructions can be completed in a total of two units of time, giving an ILP factor of 3/2; which means 3/2 = 1.5 greater than without ILP.

One of the goals of compilers and processors designers is to use as much ILP as possible. Ordinary programs are written execute instructions in sequence; one after the other, in the order as written by programmers. ILP allows the compiler and the processor to overlap the execution of multiple instructions or even to change the order in which instructions are executed.

How much ILP exists in programs depends on the application type, for example, in graphics and scientific applications the amount can be very large while in cryptography the amount much less.

Micro-architectural techniques that use ILP include:

In recent years, ILP techniques have been used for performance improvements in conditions where the difference between processor operating frequencies and memory access times is large. As of 2008, a cache "miss" costs several hundreds of CPU cycles in a main memory access; with much longer latency compared when the processor finds that the memory location is in the cache. Hence, this technique was proved to be insufficient to save the CPU time from waiting for the off-chip data. Instead, the industry is moving towards improveing higher levels of parallelism using techniques such as multiprocessing and multithreading.

<doc id="139142" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=139142" title="Data parallelism">
Data parallelism

Data parallelism (also known as loop-level parallelism) is a form of parallel computing for multiple processors using a technique for distributing the data across different parallel processor nodes. It contrasts to task parallelism as another form of parallelism.

In a multiprocessor system where each one is executing a single set of instructions, data parallelism is achieved when each processor performs the same task on different pieces of distributed data. In some situations, a single execution thread controls operations on all pieces of data. In others, different threads control the operation, but they execute the same code. 

For example, if we are running code on a 2-processor system (CPUs A and B) in a parallel computing environment, and we want to do a task on some data D, it is possible to tell CPU A to do that task on one part of D and CPU B on another part of D simultaneously (at the same time), in order to reduce the runtime of the execution. 

Data parallelism is used by many applications especially data processing applications; one of the examples is database applications. Most real programs use a combination of data parallelism and task parallelism.

Task parallelism

Task parallelism (also known as Thread level parallelism, function parallelism and control parallelism) is a form of parallel computing for multiple processors using a technique for distributing execution of processes and threads across different parallel processor nodes. It contrasts to data parallelism as another form of parallelism.

In a multiprocessor system, task parallelism is achieved when each processor executes a different thread (or process) on the same or different data. The threads may execute the same or different code. Different execution threads communicate with one another usually to pass data as they work.

As a simple example, if we are running code on a 2-processor system (CPUs "a" & "b") in a parallel computing environment and we want to do tasks "A" and "B" , it is possible to tell CPU "a" to do task "A" and CPU "b" to do task 'B" simultaneously (at the same time), in order to reduce the runtime of the execution. 

Task parallelism is used by multi-user and multitasking operating systems, and applications depending on processes and threads, unlike data processing applications (see data parallelism). Most real programs use a combination of Task parallelism and Data parallelism.

In Realtime Operating Systems (RTOS), interrupt latency is the time between the generation of an interrupt by a device (or a peripheral) and servicing the device which generated the interrupt. For many operating systems (OS), the OS code is programmed so that devices are serviced as soon as the device's interrupt handler is executed. Interrupt latency depends on the CPU, interrupt controllers, interrupt masking, and the operating system's (OS) "interrupt handling methods".

Context switch

A context switch is the computing process of saving and restoring the state (context) of a CPU such that multiple processes can share a single CPU resource. The context switch is an essential feature of a multitasking operating system. 

Context switches are usually time consuming and much of the design of operating systems is to minimize the time of context switches. 

A context switch can mean a register context switch, a task context switch, a thread context switch, or a process context switch. What will be switched is determined by the processor and the operating system.

The scheduler is the part of the operating systems that manage context switching, it perform context switching in one of the following conditions:


Context switching can be performed primarily by software or hardware. Some CPUs have hardware support for context switches, else if not, it is performed totally by the operating system software. In a context switch, the state of a process must be saved somehow before running another process, so that, the scheduler resume the execution of the process from the point it was suspended; after restoring its complete state before running it again.

The Jungle Book 2 is a 2003 animated movie produced by DisneyToon Studios in Sydney, Australia. It was released by Walt Disney Pictures and Buena Vista Distribution. It was released in France on February 5, 2003, and released in the United States on February 14, 2003. It is the sequel to Walt Disney's 1967 movie "The Jungle Book". Haley Joel Osment did the voice of Mowgli, and John Goodman did the voice of Baloo. The movie was going to be a direct-to-video movie, but it was released in theaters first. The movie is not based on "The Second Jungle Book" by Rudyard Kipling (published in 1895). However, they do have some of the same characters. When released, the movie was criticised mainly for its bad animation and a story similar to the original movie. Disney released the VHS and DVD versions on June 10, 2003. On June 17, 2008 a Special Edition DVD was released.

Mowgli feels unwelcome and out of place in the human village where he now lives. When Baloo arrives for a visit, Mowgli leaves with him to go back to the jungle. However, his friend Shanti thinks he was taken by force. She follows him into the jungle. Shere Khan is still hunting for Mowgli, which puts him, as well as Shanti and Baloo, in danger. Mowgli must decide whether he wants to live in the jungle with Baloo, or stay in the village with Shanti.






The band Smash Mouth recorded a cover of the Sherman Brothers song, "I Wanna Be Like You" (originally from the 1967 musical movie), which is featured on this movie's soundtrack.


Many people thought that "The Jungle Book 2" was too much like the original 1967 classic. Many people thought it should have gone direct-to-video like what it was originally made for. On Rotten Tomatoes, the general opinion is "This inferior rehash of "The Jungle Book" should have gone straight to video." Based on 86 reviews, the movie has a "rotten" 19%, with an average score of 4.4. In the "cream of the crop" division, the movie has a 17% with an average score of 4.1. In the RT Community, it has a 30%, with an average score of 3.7.

The movie has made a total domestic gross of $47,901,582.

Task (computers)

A task is a set of program instructions that are loaded in memory, then the address registers is loaded with the initial address to start running the task. It is defined as ""an execution path through address space where part of a plan will be accomplished after executing the task'"". 

Processes are often called tasks in embedded operating systems so "task" gives a meaning of a real-time (also small) application, which differs from a process. A process is an instance of a computer program. The kernel creates a process by allocating some memory (in kernel address space and user address space), loading program code from a disk or another part of memory into the newly allocated space, building the process tables and other operating systems structures, calculating the initial address then executes the process as one or more tasks.

Both "task" and "process" should be distinguished from event, which takes place at a specific time and place, and which can be planned for in a computer program. In a computer graphical user interface (GUI), an event can be as simple as a mouse click or keystroke.

A computer program itself is just a passive collection of instructions, while a process is the actual execution of those instructions. 

Several processes may be associated with the same program; for example, opening up several windows of the same program often means more than one process is being executed. In the computing world, processes are "formally" defined by the operating systems (OS) running them and so may differ in detail from one OS to another; for example in Microsoft Windows environment each instance of the same application is called a task.

Flying squirrel

The Flying squirrel is a sociable, noisy rodent that doesn't really fly; it glides from trees, using a flap of loose skin that connects its front and hind legs It can glide up to 150 feet (46 m), steering with its tail. It lands on a tree trunk, gripping it with all four feet.

This squirrel is nocturnal (most active at night). It has a life span of about five years in the wild, and about 13 years in captivity. Flying squirrels live in deciduous forests in North America. The flying squirrel is an endangered species. 

Flying squirrels eat mostly plants, like seeds, nuts, leaves, maple sap, bulbs, bark, flowers, and roots. Less often, they eat insects, eggs, worms, small birds, and other small animals.

Flying squirrels are hunted by weasels, foxes, hawks, and coyotes.

S1m0ne

S1m0ne is a 2002 movie directed by Andrew Niccol. It stars Al Pacino.

Viktor Taransky (Al Pacino) is working on a movie project. He is running out of money and his star decided not to do it anymore, so his movie is in trouble. A computer programmer named Hank approaches Viktor and tells him that he is able to create a computer-generated character. Hank soon dies of cancer and gives the program to Viktor. Viktor uses the program to insert an actress in place of his original star and the movie is a huge hit. The program, titled "Simulation One," is simplified to "Simone."

Viktor is at first very happy that this is a success, and has her star in more movies. For her voice, he simply speaks into a microphone and the computer makes it a female voice. He conducts interviews. Simone goes on to win an Academy Award and is wildly famous. However, Viktor soon becomes unhappy with Simone and tries to make her unpopular by having her star in a bad movie. However, the people still love Simone and the movie is still a success. Finally, Viktor uses a virus and erases her program from the computer. He then throws a trunk full of CDs into the ocean.

The police come and arrest Viktor and charge her for the murder of Simone. They have a video showing him dragging the trunk into the ocean; they believe that there was a body inside. He tells them that Simone was never real, but they don't believe him. His ex-wife Elaine (Catherine Keener) and his daughter Lainey (Evan Rachel Wood) enter his studio. Lainey ejects the floppy disk, restoring the Simone program, and they create a short movie that shows that Simone is alive and well. The police let him go. Elaine and Lainey convince Viktor that Simone is a symbol now and that they should continue to keep her alive. The last scene shows Viktor and Simone together, with Viktor announcing that Simone and he just had a child.

Joe Byrne (bushranger)

Joseph Byrne also known as Joe Byrne (November 1856 - June 28 1880) was an Australian bushranger. He is known as the lieutenant of the Kelly Gang. He was shot dead in the siege of Glenrowan. Joe Byrne was a very good shot, a good horseman and skilled at living in the bush. This made it difficult for the police to capture him. His skill at writing helped him to write the items that were important in starting the Kelly legend. He wrote the famous Jerilderie letter. There is also a legend that Ned Kelly, with Byrne's help, was going to start an independent republic in north east Victoria. The siege at Glenrowan was the first step.

Joe was born at Woolshed, near Beechworth, in November 1856. His father, Patrick Byrne, had come from County Carlow, Ireland, in 1849, to join his father, Joseph, who had come to Australia as a convict in 1834. Joe's mother was an Irish girl from Galway. The family moved to Sebastopol, a small gold mining town, about two kilometres farther up the valley. Joe learned to speak Chinese from the Chinese miners who lived in a small camp near his house. He was educated at a small Roman Catholic school at Woolshed.

After leaving school in 1870, Joe had a number of jobs including driving a delivery cart for a tannery, putting up fences, looking for gold, wood cutting, and shearing. He often visited the Chinese village at Beechworth and became addicted to opium. During the celebrations for the Prince of Wales birthday in 1873, Joe saw a suit of Chinese armour in the Beechworth museum. This armour provided the ideas for the armour the Kelly Gang wore at Glenrowan.

In September 1873, Byrne was in court for taking a neighbour, Anton Wick's horse. He had ridden it for several days before bringing it back. He had to pay a fine of 20 shillings. In December 1875, he was in court again for taking a saddle, but the court believed Byrne when he said he had found it in the bush. On May 20, 1876, Joe Byrne and his friend, Aaron Sherritt, stole a cow and cut it up for the meat. Someone saw them and told the police. They were taken to court and given six months in the Beechworth Gaol. In prison, Byrne and Sherritt met Jim Kelly, who was the brother of Ned and Dan Kelly. Joe Byrne met Ned Kelly in 1876 and they became friends.

Byrne was probably at the Kelly house on 15 April, 1878, when Constable Fitzpatrick said that Ned Kelly shot him and that Ellen Kelly, Ned's mother, had hit him over the head with a shovel. Ned and Dan Kelly went into hiding in the bush at Bullock Creek, an old gold mining area. The police offered a reward of £100 for them, and Ellen Kelly was sent to gaol for three years.

Joe Byrne was at Stringybark Creek with the Kelly brothers and Steve Hart on 26 October, 1878, when they found four police officers on their trail, and shot three of them dead. Joe Byrne shot dead Trooper Scanlon, and was wearing Scanlon's ring at the time of his death. The gang were made outlaws on 15 November 1878, which meant they could be legally killed by anyone at any time. A reward of £2000 pounds (about AU$754,000 in 2008) was offered for them, dead or alive.

Byrne was Kelly's lieutenant, and the two of them planned the gang's actions. The Kelly Gang robbed the Euroa branch of the National Bank of Australia and took over £2,000. Joe Byrne wrote a letter in red ink for Ned Kelly which was sent to Donald Cameron, a local member of the Victorian Parliament. Ned said justice had not been done in the case of his mother and himself. It ended: "For I need no lead or powder to revenge my cause, and if words be louder I will oppose your laws."

The police locked up over 20 possible supporters of the Kelly gang between January 1879 and April 1879 under the "Felons Apprehension Act 1878". This increased public support for the gang, especially in north east Victoria. Joe Byrne was able to use this increase this by writing a number poems about Ned Kelly and his gang, including "My Name is Ned Kelly":
My friends are all united,
My mates are lying near.
We sleep beneath shady trees,
No danger do we fear."
Joe Byrne often visited his mother at her house in Beechworth. He was also seen drinking in hotels in the town, even though there was a reward for him. He could do it because of his skill and daring, and because the police were badly trained and badly led, and because of the support of local people for the Kelly Gang.

Kelly and Byrne planned their next robbery for Jerilderie. On 10 February, 1879, dressed as policemen, the gang robbed the Bank of New South Wales at Jerilderie taking another £2,000. Byrne wrote the Jerilderie Letter which wanted an independent republic in north east Victoria. The money from both the Euroa and Jerilderie robberies was given to the gang's family, friends and supporters. 

After the Jerilderie robbery, the gang went into hiding for 16 months. This increased their reputation and embarrassed the government of Victoria and the police. The Victorian Government increased the reward for the Kelly Gang to £8,000 (about AU$2,000,000 in 2005).

Byrne and Kelly planned another bank robbery in Benalla in 1880. They thought Aaron Sherritt was being used by police to get information about them. Byrne had told Sherritt to tell the police that the gang was planning a robbery in the Goulburn River while they were really planning the Jerilderie robbery. Kelly and Byrne believed that Sherritt could no longer be trusted. They also knew he was being protected by the police. Byrne and Dan Kelly murdered Sherritt on 26 June, 1880. Ned Kelly believed that this would bring a large group of police to Beechworth to search for the killers. 

The next day, the Kelly Gang took over the town of Glenrowan. They tore up the railway tracks because they knew the police would travel by train to Beechworth They held over 60 people hostage in Jones' Hotel. Thomas Curnow, the local school teacher, escaped and stopped the police train before it could crash on the missing track. The police were able to the hotel.

Joe Byrne helped design the armour worn by all members of the gang at Glenrowan. This did not stop him from being shot in the groin cutting his femoral artery. He was in the middle of a speech about the gang when he was shot. He died quickly from loss of blood on 28 June 1880. The police dragged his body out of the hotel before burning it to the ground.

The next day his body was hung on the door of the police cells at Benalla, and photographed by newspaper reporters. It was only removed after a young woman begged the police to let Byrne rest in peace. His family did not take his body and the police would not give it to anyone else, they thought a funeral would become a starting point for a rebellion. He was buried in an unmarked grave on the edge of the Benalla cemetery. 

Dan Kelly and Steve Hart were also killed in the siege, and Ned Kelly was captured and tried in Melbourne. Ned Kelly was hanged at Old Melbourne Gaol on 11 November 1880. There is a legend that Kelly and Byrne had written a Declaration for the Republic of north east Victoria which was destroyed by the Victorian Government.

By writing the letters and the bush ballads, and designing the armour, Joe Byrne and Ned Kelly helped make the Kelly legend. In the following 125 years, the legend has grown. There have been a number of films made about the Kelly Gang including "The Story of the Kelly Gang" in 1906, the world's first feature-length movie. In 2003, Orlando Bloom played the part of Joe Byrne in Gregor Jordan's movie, "Ned Kelly".

Australian novelist Peter Carey won the 2001 Booker Prize and the Commonwealth Writers Prize for the "True History of the Kelly Gang". This was based on the Jerilderie letter written by Byrne. 

Ned Kelly and the Kelly Gang has been made famous by Sidney Nolan wearing the armour designed by Joe Byrne in a famous set of paintings. This was used as a scene at the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.

College basketball is basketball played between teams from colleges or universities, usually in the United States. The most popular American college basketball league is the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Basketball in the NCAA is put into three divisions: Division I, Division II and Division III. However, there are other college basketball leagues, such as the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). College basketball teams are split into conferences, which are groups of about 10 teams.

Division I of the NCAA has two tournaments to determine who the national champion. One tournament is for men and one is for women. The men's tournament has 68 teams, and the women's tournament has 64 teams. These tournaments are often called "March Madness".

There are some differences between NCAA basketball and NBA basketball.

Nundle, New South Wales

Nundle is a village in the New England area of New South Wales, Australia. It was once the centre of Nundle Shire. Most of this area, including the village of Nundle, was added to the new Tamworth Regional Council in 2004. The village is 400 km north of Sydney and about 56 km south east of Tamworth. In 2006 there were 289 people living in Nundle.
Nundle was settled when gold was found nearby at “The Hanging Rock” and Swamp Creek in 1852. By June 1852 there were 300 people digging for gold at Oakenville Creek. . People from California, Europe and China were also digging along the Peel River and up the mountain slopes. By 1865 there were about 500 people living there and about 50 shops and small businesses had started. A school building was put up in December 1871. Lessons started in 1872. Nundle was made a town in 1885. In 1924 the Peel River Bridge was built. In 1941 electricity was connected to the town. During 1966 the swimming pool was opened by the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair. There were 1350 people living in the area in 1969. In 1979 the Premier of New South Wales, Neville Wran, opened the new Chaffey Dam. Sheep, cattle and timber are now the main business activities in Nundle. 

There are many old buildings: the Nundle Woollen Mill, old Court House, Peel Inn and Primitive Methodist Church. The old Nundle Courthouse and Police Station have been placed on the Register of the National Estate. 

Nundle is of the best areas in the State for finding crystals. Some gold and other precious stones can be found including zircons, green jasper, sapphires and serpentine minerals. Nundle is a popular tourist destination for both casual travellers and motorcycle riders. Nearby is the interesting Hanging Rock mining village with good views of the Nundle valley.

A new bridge across the Peel River at Nundle was finished in 2008. The cost of $683,000 was paid by the NSW State Government. 

In July 2008 the rare Euphrasia arguta was rediscovered in a State Forest near Nundle. This plant was last recorded in 1904. It is believed to have grown after fire control burning the previous summer.


The annual Go for Gold Festival is held each Easter with around 4,000 visitors. The State Member for Tamworth told the NSW Parliament “that visitors had come to Nundle from all points of the compass during the Easter weekend to enjoy the relaxed atmosphere and the beautiful setting.” The Great Nundle Dog Race, only open to working dogs, is run on the first Sunday in May and attracts many visitors. This event helps to raise money for sporting equipment, computers, books and trips for students at the Nundle Public School.

The National Library of Australia is Australia's largest reference library. It was started by the "National Library Act". The library has to keep and develop a national collection of library material. This includes a broad and complete collection of library material about Australia and the Australian people. It is located in Canberra, the capital of Australia.

The National Library of Australia, was officially set up with the "National Library Act, 1960". It had been working as a National Library, not just a Parliamentary Library, since 1901.

In 1901, a Commonwealth Parliamentary Library was started to help the newly formed Federal Parliament of Australia. From its beginning, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library began to develop of a truly national collection. In 1907 the chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Library Committee, Sir Frederick Holder, gave the reasons for having the library. Australia should have a great public library, like the famous Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. It would be a home for the literature of the world, for ever.

The library building was opened in 1968.

The Library's collections of Australian objects has become the nation's single most important collection of materials recording the Australian cultural history. The Library collects Australian materials of all kinds including:

The Library has good collections in the performing arts, including dance. The Library also has big collections of general overseas and rare book materials, as well as world-class Asian and Pacific collections which add to the Australian collections.

The print collections include large collections of microform. The Library keeps the National Reserve Braille Collection. In total, over 5 million items are held. Films and sound recordings are kept in a separate collection run by the National Film and Sound Archive in Canberra.

The Library has digitised over 130,000 items from its collection. The 100,000th was a photo . These digital items can be seen on the Internet. The Library is a world leader in digital preservation techniques.. It keeps an Internet archive of selected Australian websites, called the Pandora Archive.

Retail are goods or items that are sold at one location such as department stores or by post, where the customer can order items from a retailer and have the items delivered by post or mail.

Retailing is the word given to locations where retail items are sold. These places include shops or stores.

Shops and Stores can be found at places such as department stores (malls) or markets; places where stalls or stands are setup at a cleared area for large public attraction.

Other ways of purchasing retail items is by mail-order; a process in which items are ordered by the customer and then the items are delivered by "post" or "courier", telephone; the customer phones or rings a retailer and orders the items to be delivered or door-to-door; in which a sales person goes to a possible customers home and tries to sell an item.

Gunnedah is a town in north-western New South Wales, Australia. In 2006 there were 7,542 people living in the town..

Gunnedah is on the Oxley and Kamilaroi Highways. It is 475 kms from Sydney. There is also a railway to Sydney. There is a daily train service, the Countrylink Xplorer, between Sydney and Moree.

The major business is agriculture. Gunnedah produces cotton, coal, beef, lamb, pork, and cereal and oilseed grains.
Gunnedah is also the home of AgQuip, Australia's largest annual exhibition of agricultural equipment.

The Gunnedah area was the home of the Australian Aborigines who spoke the Kamilaroi (Gamilaraay) language. The area of the town was settled by Europeans in 1833 or 1834.

Dorothea Mackellar wrote her famous poem "My Country" (popularly known as "I Love a Sunburnt Country") about her family's farm near Gunnedah. Every year the Dorothea Mackellar Poetry Awards for school students are held in Gunnedah.

Coal was found on Black Jack Hill in 1877. By 1891, 6,000 tons of coal had been dug from shafts. The Gunnedah Colliery Company was registered in May, 1899. One month later a private railway some 5.7 km in length had been completed from the railway station to their mine. In September, 1957, the Government Railway took over the working of the line.

Gunnedah Shire is 264 metres above sea level on the Liverpool Plains in the Namoi River valley. It is very flat. The tallest hills are only 200 metres above the flat plains. The climate is hot in summer, mild in winter and dry. Rainstorms occasionally cause flooding of the Namoi River. Floods can cut transport links to the town and cut it off from the outside world.

The Gunnedah area has a lot of Australian wildlife, including kangaroos, echidnas and koalas. Koalas can often be seen in trees within the town. 

There is a newspaper, the Namoi Valley Independent. There are 2 radio stations 2MO and 2GGG. 2MO claims to be the first station started in Australia outside the capital cities.

Gunnedah railway station is on the Mungindi (or North West) railway line, 475 km from Sydney. The station was opened in 1879. There is a large station building with single platform. There is also a passing loop and small goods yard. There is a single daily Xplorer diesel railmotor operating between Sydney and Moree.

<doc id="139299" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=139299" title="Instruction pipelining">
Instruction pipelining

An instruction pipeline is a technique used in the design of modern microprocessors, microcontrollers and CPUs to increase their instruction throughput (the number of instructions that can be executed in a unit of time).

The main idea is to divide (termed "split") the processing of a CPU instruction, as defined by the instruction microcode, into a series of independent steps of micro-operations (also called "microinstructions", "micro-op" or "µop"), with storage at the end of each step. This allows the CPUs control logic to handle instructions at the processing rate of the slowest step, which is much faster than the time needed to process the instruction as a single step. 

The term pipeline refers to the fact that each step is carrying a single microinstruction (like a drop of water), and each step is linked to another step (analogy; similar to water pipes).

Most modern CPUs are driven by a clock. The CPU consists internally of logic and memory (flip flops). When the clock signal arrives, the flip flops store their new value then the logic requires a period of time to decode the flip flops new values. Then the next clock pulse arrives and the flip flops store another values, and so on. By breaking the logic into smaller pieces and inserting flip flops between pieces of logic, the time required by the logic (to decode values till generating valid outputs depending on these values) is reduced. In this way the clock period can be reduced.<br>For example, the RISC pipeline is broken into five stages with a set of flip flops between each stage as follow:

Processors with pipelining consist internally of stages (modules) which can semi-independently work on separate microinstructions. Each stage is linked by flip flops to the next strange (like a "chain") so that the stage's output is an input to another stage until the job of processing instructions is done. Such organization of processor internal modules reduces the instruction's overall processing time.

A non-pipeline architecture is not as efficient because some CPU modules are idle while another module is active during the instruction cycle. Pipelining does not completely remove idle time in a pipelined CPU, but making CPU modules work in parallel increases instruction throughput.

An instruction pipeline is said to be "fully pipelined" if it can accept a new instruction every clock cycle. A pipeline that is not fully pipelined has wait cycles that delay the progress of the pipeline.

Advantages of Pipelining:

Disadvantages of Pipelining:<br>

To the right is a generic pipeline with four stages:

The top gray box is the list of instructions waiting to be executed; the bottom gray box is the list of instructions that have been completed; and the middle white box is the pipeline.

Execution is as follows:

When a "hiccup" (interruption) in execution occurs, a "bubble" is created in the pipeline in which nothing useful happens. In cycle 2, the fetching of the purple instruction is delayed and the decoding stage in cycle 3 now contains a bubble. Everything behind the purple instruction is delayed as well but everything in front of the purple instruction continues with execution.

Clearly, when compared to the execution above, the bubble yields a total execution time of 8 clock ticks instead of 7.

Bubbles are like stalls (delays), in which nothing useful will happen for the fetch, decode, execute and writeback. It can is like a NOP (short for No OPeration) code.

A typical instruction to add two numbers might be codice_1, which adds the values found in memory locations A and B, and then puts the result in memory location C. In a pipelined processor the pipeline controller would break this into a series of tasks similar to:

The locations 'R1' and 'R2' are registers in the CPU. The values stored in memory locations labeled 'A' and 'B' are loaded (copied) into these registers, then added, and the result is stored in a memory location labeled 'C'.

In this example the pipeline is three stages long- load, execute, and store. Each of the steps are called pipeline stages.

On a non-pipelined processor, only one stage can be working at a time so the entire instruction has to complete before the next instruction can begin. On a pipelined processor, all of the stages can be working at once on different instructions. So when this instruction is at the execute stage, a second instruction will be at the decode stage and a 3rd instruction will be at the fetch stage.

To better understand the concept, we can look at a theoretical 3-stage pipeline:

and a pseudo-code assembly listing to be executed:

This is how it would be executed:

The LOAD instruction is fetched from memory.

The LOAD instruction is executed, while the MOVE instruction is fetched from memory.

The LOAD instruction is in the Store stage, where its result (the number 40) will be stored in the register A.
In the meantime, the MOVE instruction is being executed. 
Since it must move the contents of A into B, it must wait for the ending of the LOAD instruction.

The STORE instruction is loaded, while the MOVE instruction is finishing off and the ADD is calculating.

And so on. Note that, sometimes, an instruction will depend on the result of another one (like our MOVE example). When more than one instruction references a particular location for an operand, either reading it (as an input) or writing it (as an output), executing those instructions in an order different from the original program order can lead to the hazards situation (mentioned above).

Jurassic Coast

The Jurassic Coast is a stretch of coast in south-west England. It is between Orcombe Point near Exmouth in East Devon and Old Harry Rocks near Swanage in East Dorset. This is 95 miles long (153 km). 

Because of its geology it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, known as "Dorset and East Devon Coast". Its entire length can be walked on the South West Coast Path.

Some of the greatest fossil discoveries were made in this area. 
These finds were by Mary Anning in the first part of the 19th century. This area was home to Mary, a collector who searched for fossils of the coastline around Lyme Regis and discovered several complete Ichthyosaur fossils. 

The Jurassic Coast is made of Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous cliffs, spanning 185 million years of geological history.

The site contains a number of special features and shows different landforms, including the natural arch at Durdle Door, the cove and limestone folding at Lulworth Cove and an island, the Isle of Portland. 

Chesil Beach (or Chesil Bank) is one of England's three shingle (gravel) beaches. It is a barrier beach which runs parallel to the coastline and connects to Portland Bill (see photo). Between the barrier and the regular coastline is a lagoon.

Golden Cap is the highest place on the south coast of England. It is high.

This section notes the main rocks found on the coast, starting with the lowest (earliest).

The Blue Lias is a geologic formation in the Jurassic Coast and parts of south Wales. It is part of the Lias Group. 

The Blue Lias consists of a sequence of limestone and shale layers. It was laid down in late Triassic and early Jurassic times, between 195 and 200 million years ago. The Blue Lias is famous for its fossils, especially ammonites. Also found were remains of a number of dinosaurs, and the pterosaur "Dimorphodon".

The Blue Lias alternates between limestone, (with some clay), and mudstone.

These are special towns that are related to the Jurassic Coast:

Instruction (computer science)

In computer science, an instruction is a single operation of a processor defined by the processor instruction set. 

The size or length of an instruction varies widely, from as little as 4-bits in some microcontrollers to many as multiples of a bytes in some very long instruction word (VLIW) systems. Most modern processors used in personal computers, mainframes, and supercomputers have instruction sizes between 16 and 64 bits. In some architectures specially Reduced instruction set computers, instructions are of fixed length, typically corresponding with that architecture's word size. 

On traditional architectures, an instruction includes an opcode specifying the operation to be performed, such as "add contents of memory to register", and zero or more operand specifiers, which may specify registers, memory locations, or literal data. The operand specifiers may have addressing modes determining their meaning or may be in fixed fields.

In VLIW architectures, which include many microcode architectures, multiple simultaneous operations and operands are specified in a single instruction.

Instructions are rarely specified using their machine code form; they may be specified by programmers using an assembly language or, more commonly, may be generated by compilers.

There is another more general definition for an "instruction" not only related to the processor instruction set, which is: "An "instruction" may be any representation of an element of an executable program, such as a bytecode".

<doc id="139330" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=139330" title="Superscalar">
Superscalar

A superscalar CPU architecture implements a form of parallel computing called Instruction-level parallelism inside a single processor which allows faster CPU throughput at the same clock rate. A superscalar processor executes more than one instruction during a clock cycle by simultaneously dispatching multiple instructions (termed instruction dispatching) to multiple redundant functional units built inside the processor. Each functional unit is not a separate CPU core but an execution resource inside the CPU such as an arithmetic logic unit, floating point unit (FPU), a bit shifter, or a multiplier.

While most superscalar CPUs are also pipelined, it possible to have a non-pipelined superscalar CPU or a pipelined non-superscalar CPU.

The superscalar technique is associated with several identifying characteristics of the CPU core:

Each instruction executed by a Scalar processors manipulates one or two data items at a time, while each instruction executed by a Vector processor operates simultaneously on many data items. A superscalar processor is a mixture of the two:

In a superscalar CPU an instruction dispatcher reads instructions from memory and decides which ones can be run in parallel, dispatching them on the multiple redundant functional units available inside the CPU. 

Superscalar CPU design is concerned with improving accuracy of the instruction dispatcher, and allowing it to keep the multiple functional units in use at all times. As of 2008 all general-purpose CPUs are superscalar, a typical superscalar CPU may include up to 4 ALUs, 2 FPUs, and two SIMD units. If the dispatcher failed to utilize all of the units at all times the performance of the CPU will suffer.

Available performance improvement in Superscalar CPU design is limited by two key areas: 

However even given infinitely fast dependency checking logic inside a conventional superscalar CPU, if the instruction stream itself has many dependencies, this would also limit the possible speedup. Thus the degree of intrinsic parallelism in the code stream forms another limitation.

No matter how fast the dispatcher speed, there is a practical limit on how many instructions can be simultaneously dispatched. While hardware advances will allow greater numbers of functional units (e.g, ALUs), the problem of checking instruction dependencies increases to a limit that the achievable superscalar dispatching limit is somewhat small. -- Likely on the order of five to six simultaneously dispatched instructions.




The various alternative techniques are not mutually exclusive—they can be (and frequently are) combined in a single processor. Thus it is possible to design a multicore CPU is where each core is an independent processor containing multiple parallel superscalar pipelines. Some multicore processors also include vector capability.

SA80 or "Small Arms of the 80's" is the name of a weapons family used by the British Army and Royal Marines, all are of bullpup design; meaning the magazine is placed behind the trigger allowing the weapon to be shorter yet still have a long barrel.

The series includes an assault rifle known as the L85 and a Light Support Weapon (LSW) designated the L86 as well as a Carbine variant for helicopter crews and a bolt action army cadet variant. The LSW variant is far more accurate than it's predecessor, and is prominent in army FSGs (Fire Support Groups). And although amazingly accurate for their size (Army marksmanship tests were redesigned after the SA80 introduction because it was so accurate), the SA80 family has been plagued by poor reliability problems that have been addressed with an upgrade by the German arms company H&K when it was British owned; resulting in the A2 series, however not all models have been upgraded and A1 generations can be recognized by their simple circular cocking handle. A new upgrade program is under way for a very small number of SA80s since late 2007.

The SA80 also has a cadet force variant (L98 A2 Cadet GP) that is the same size, but has no change lever (a lever that switches the mode of fire from semi-automatic to fully-automatic fire), and is used throughout the ACF, with a success rate far higher than the old, bolt-action A1 version.

Raymond "Ray" Emery (born September 28, 1982 in Hamilton, Ontario) is a professional ice hockey player. He currently plays for the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL). Emery has also played for the Ottawa Senators, Philadelphia Flyers and Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has also played in KHL with the Atlant Moscow Oblast. Emery has been awarded many honors, most from the minor league.

Emery has been given various nicknames over his career, most goes by "Razor" and "Sugar Ray." In the 2001 NHL entry draft, Emery was chosen 99th overall by the Ottawa Senators. Emery was made starting goaltender in the 2006-07 NHL season. That year, the Senators made it to the Stanley Cup finals. On June 20, 2008, after some off-ice incidents, the Senators released Emery. Under one month later, Emery signed a one year, $2M contract with Atlant Mytishchi of the Russian KHL. After his time in Russia, it was announced on June 10, 2009 that the Philadelphia Flyers had signed him to a one-year deal for $1.5 million. In March of 2010, Flyers GM Paul Holmgren announced that Emery would miss the remainder of the season because of avascular necrosis and that a bone graft would be done to alleviate his hip issues. Emery began workout and rehabilitation process and later signed a one year, two-way contract with the Anaheim Ducks on February 7, 2011. During his time with the Ducks, he tied for fourth in the league after he posted a 7–2–0 record with a 2.28 goals-against average (GAA) and a .926 save percentage (SV%) in 10 regular season games going into the playoffs. He attended the Chicago Blackhawks training camp on a tryout basis and was later signed by the Blackhawks to a 1-year, $600,000 deal. 

Emery has been known for getting into several altercations while playing ice hockey, a rarity for a ice-hockey goaltender.. Emery once fought two Buffalo Sabres players, Martin Biron and Andrew Peters in a line brawl during the 2006-07 NHL season. He also fought with his teammate, Brian McGrattan, during a practice in January 2008. He has also fought with teammate's Jason Spezza and Chris Neil.

It may have its own internal control sequence unit, some registers, and other internal units such as a sub-ALU or FPU, or some smaller, more specific components.

Now modern CPUs have multiple parallel execution units, referred to as scalar or superscalar design. The simplest arrangement is to use one, the bus manager, to manage the memory interface, and the others to perform calculations. Additionally, modern CPUs execution units are usually pipelined.

Pre-1600 Atlantic hurricane seasons

The pre-1600 Atlantic hurricane seasons talks about all known Atlantic tropical cyclones before to 1600. While info for every storm that happened is not available, some parts of the coastline had enough people to give info of hurricane happenings. Each season was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic basin. Most tropical cyclone formation occurs between June 1 and November 30.

Observation info for years before 1492 is completely unavailable because record keeping was non-existent in the pre-Columbian era, and any records that may have once existed have long since been lost. Even info from the early years of the Columbian era is suspect and incomplete because the difference between a hurricane and an extratropical system was not drawn by Renaissance scientists and sailors and because European exploration and colonization of the regions affected by hurricanes did not begin in earnest until the mid-16th century.

However, paleotempestological research allows reconstruction of pre-historic hurricane activity trends on timescales of centuries to millennia. A theory has been postulated that an anti-phase pattern exists between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast. During the quiescent periods, a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast. During the hyperactive period, more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High—controlled by the North Atlantic Oscillation—was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean. In fact, few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000–1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium; these quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD, when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3–5 times. On the Atlantic coast, chance of landfalling hurricanes has doubled in the recent millennium compared to the one and a half millennia before.

The key concept of OoO processing is to allow the processor to avoid a class of delays (termed: ""stalls "") that occur when the data needed to perform an operation are unavailable.

OoO processors fill these "slots" in time with other instructions that are ready, then re-order the results at the end to make it appear that the instructions were processed as normal. The way the instructions are ordered in the original computer code is known as program order, in the processor they are handled in data order (the order in which the data, operands, become available in the processor's registers). Fairly complex circuitry is needed to convert from one ordering to the other and maintain a logical ordering of the output; the processor itself runs the instructions which seems as if in random order.

The benefit of OoO processing grows as the instruction pipeline expands and the speed difference between main memory (or cache memory) and the processor increases. On modern machines, the processor runs many times faster than the memory, so during the time an in-order processor spends waiting for data to arrive, it could have processed a large number of instructions.

In earlier In-order processors, the processing of instructions is normally done in these steps:

Out-of-order processors breaks up the processing of instructions into these steps:

In the examples outlined above, the OoO processor avoids the stall that occurs in step (2) of the in-order processor when the instruction is not completely ready to be processed due to missing data.

Speculative execution

In computer science, speculative execution is the execution of code, before being sure if the result will be needed. 

The technique is used in most high-performance microprocessors to execute a complete instructions or parts of instructions before being sure whether this execution is required

In the context of functional programming, the term "speculative evaluation" is used instead.

<doc id="139441" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=139441" title="Branch prediction">
Branch prediction

In computer architecture, a branch predictor is the part of a processor that determines whether a conditional branch (jump) in the instruction flow of a program is likely to be taken or not. This is called branch prediction. 

Branch predictors are important in today's modern, superscalar processors for achieving high performance. They allow processors to fetch and execute instructions without waiting for a branch to be resolved.

Almost all pipelined processors do branch prediction of some form, because they must guess the address of the next instruction to fetch before the current instruction has been executed. 

Many earlier microprogrammed CPUs did not do branch prediction because there was little or no performance requirements; for this reason there is no need for altering the flow of the instruction stream.

Key exchange

Key exchange is any method in cryptography by which cryptographic keys are exchanged between users, allowing use of a cryptographic system. 

If two parties wish to exchange encrypted messages, each needs to know how to decrypt received messages and to encrypt sent messages. The information they require to do so depends on the encryption technique they might use. If they use a code, both will require a copy of the same codebook. If they use a cipher, they will need appropriate keys. If the cipher is a symmetric key cipher, both will need a copy of the same key. If an asymmetric key cipher with the public/private key property, both will need the other's public key. 

The key exchange problem is how to exchange whatever keys or other information needed so, in such a way, that no one else can obtain a copy. Usually, this required trusted secure channel. With the arrival of (public key / private key) cipher algorithms, the encrypting key (aka, the public key) could be made public, since (at least for ""high quality"" ciphers) no one without the decrypting key (aka, the private key) could decrypt the message. 

In principle, then, the only remaining problem was to be sure that a public key actually belonged to its claimed owner, this is not a problem easy to solve; specially when the two users involved have never met and know nothing about each other.

In 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published a cryptographic protocol, (Diffie-Hellman key exchange), which allows users to establish secure channels in order to exchange keys, even if an attacker is monitoring that communication channel. However, Diffie-Hellman key exchange did not address the "identity authentication" problem of being sure of the actual identity of the person or an entity.

Public key infrastructures have been proposed go around the problem of "identity authentication". In their most usual implementation, each user applies to a "certificate authority" for a digital certificate which serves for other users as a correct (termed: non-tamperable) authentication of identity.

In contrast, the web of trust system, which do not use central "certificate authority" at all. Each user is responsible for verifying any certificate from another user before using that certificate to communicate with the user who claims to be associated with the particular public key in a certificate, (see digital signatures). 

The problem of key exchange has not yet been solved. In particular, it has not yet been solved for the modern situation of two previously unknown users attempting to communicate electronically, as, for instance, in electronic commerce. Some of the existing work-around designs work, more or less, but are not fully satisfactory.

Secure channel

In cryptography, a secure channel is a way of transferring data that is very difficult (termed: ""resistant"") to overhear or copy (termed: ""interception"") and understand (termed): ""decrypt"") or change (termed: ""tampering"").

A confidential channel is a way of transferring data that is "resistant" to "interception", but not necessarily resistant to "tampering" nor necessarily resistant to impersonation by someone else (termed: ""spoofing"").

An authenticatable channel is a way of transferring data that is "resistant" to "spoofing" but not necessarily resistant to "interception" or "tampering".

Terminology

Terminology is the study of terms and their use. Terms are words and compound words that are used in specific contexts. Not to be confused with "terms" in everyday usages, the shortened form of technical terms (or terms of art) which are defined within an academic system or a field of specialty. Terminology studies among other things how such terms of art come to be and their interrelationships within a culture.

Terminology therefore refer to a more formal discipline which systematically studies the "labelling or designating of concepts" specific to one or more subject fields or domains of human activity, through research and analysis of terms in context, for the purpose of documenting and promoting correct usage. This study can be limited to one language or can cover more than one language at the same time ("multilingual terminology", "bilingual terminology", and so forth) or may focus on studies of terms used in teaching across different fields.

Technical terminology

Technical terminology is the specialized vocabulary of a field. These terms have specific definitions within the field, which is not necessarily the same as their meaning in common use. Jargon is similar, but more informal in definition and use, while legal terms of art or words of art have meanings that are strictly defined by law.

An industry term is a type of technical terminology that has a particular meaning within a specific industry. The phrase industry term implies that a word or phrase is a typical one within a particular industry or business and people within the industry or business will be familiar with and use the term.

The term "jargon" can, and often does, have pejorative (negative) connotations, particularly when aimed at "business culture". The marketing and public relations industries in particular have expanded the vocabulary of jargon that marks the global business environment.

Flag of Oman

The national flag of Oman () has three stripes (white, green and red) with a red bar on the left that contains the national emblem of Oman. The white stands for peace and prosperity, the green for fertility and the Green Mountains, and the red for battles against foreign invaders. The red is also the colour of the former flag of the nation when it was known simply as the Sultanate of Musca and Oman.
Until 1970, Oman used the plain red banner of the indigenous people, the Kharijite Muslims. In 1970, the Sultan introduced a complete new set of national flags. Bands of green and white were added to the fly, and the national emblem, the badge of the Albusaidi Dynasty, was placed in the canton. This shows crossed swords over a gambia, a traditional curved dagger. White has been associated historically with the Imam, the religious leader of Oman and at times the political rival to the ruling Sultan. It also symbolizes peace. Green is traditionally associated with the Jebel al Akhdar, or "Green Mountains," which lie toward the north of the country. Red is a common color in Gulf state flags. The national emblem is said to date back to the 18th century. A curved dagger is fastened over a pair of crossed swords. An ornate horsebit links the weapons.

Mérindol is a commune of 1,923 people (2006). It is in the region Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur in the Vaucluse department in the south of France. The town has a Mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and mild winters. It does not rain very often and snow is rare. Protected by the Luberon, a mountain range, the town is sheltered from the mistral, a cold dry wind that blows from the north. The town was first built on a hill which was easy to defend. After the town was destroyed in 1545, it was rebuilt on the plain, near the river.

A ferry was in use to cross the Durance River in the year 1240. Mérindol was abandoned, probably because of plague, in the 15th century. 

In the late Middle Ages, Louis II of Provence sold the land to the lords of Abacus-Cental and Rocca Sparviera. They moved in farming families from Piedmont. The farmers were followers of Pierre Vaudes (Peter Waldo). They were part of a group, known as the Vaudois or Waldensians, who had separated from the Catholic Church in 1170. They believed in a simple life based on a line in the Gospel of Matthew. This put them in opposition to the rich and powerful church. In 1530, a Dominican priest, Jean de Roma, began a campaign against the Vaudois because he said they were heretics. His gangs attacked the town and burnt many houses and killed many of the people.

In 1540, de Roma arrested a flour miller from Mérindol, took his mill, and then burned the man at the stake. On November 18 1540, 19 more people were sentenced to death by burning at the stake, and the town was ordered to be completely destroyed. A group from the town went to the king to save the people and the village. He gave them until 1545 AD to give up their religion and rejoin the Catholic Church. On April 18 1545, the village was completely burned and about 12 of the Vaudois still living there were killed. Over one week there were attacks on 11 other small villages, and it is thought that about 3000 people were killed. Many of the Vaudois from Mérindol were able to escape and ran away to Switzerland.

In 1977, members of Vaudois organizations in Germany, France and Italy built a path in memory of the people who had been killed for their religious beliefs. The path leads to the ruins of the Vaudois church.

Voice over Internet protocol (or VoIP) is a term used for a number of protocols that are used to carry "voice data" over packed switched networks. Beforehand, telephony used a dedicated line, that was allocated to a call, during the time of that call. This was known as PSTN (or "plain switched telephony network"). Using VOIP will reduce costs, as the "dedicated line" for telephony (and fax) is no longer needed.

There are a number of technical problems that must be solved first, though:

Diffie-Hellman key exchange

Diffie-Hellman key exchange (D-H) is a cryptographic protocol that allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to securely agree on a shared secret key over an insecure communications channel. Then they use this key to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric-key cipher.

Synonyms of Diffie-Hellman key exchange include:

The scheme was first published publicly by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976, Diffie-Hellman key agreement itself is an "anonymous" (non-"authenticated") key-agreement protocol, it provides the basis for a variety of authenticated protocols, and is used to provide perfect forward secrecy in Transport Layer Security's short-lived modes.

In the original description papers, the Diffie-Hellman exchange by itself does not provide authentication of the communicating parties and is thus susceptible to a man-in-the-middle attack. An attacking person in the middle may establish two different Diffie-Hellman key exchanges, with the two members of the party "A" and "B", appearing as "A" to "B", and vice versa, allowing the attacker to decrypt (and read or store) then re-encrypt the messages passed between them. A method to authenticate the communicating parties to each other is generally needed to prevent this type of attack.

Many cryptographic authentication solutions include a Diffie-Hellman exchange. When two parties "A" and "B" have a public key infrastructure, they may digitally sign the agreed key "G", or "G" and "G", as in MQV, STS and the IKE component of the IPsec protocol suite for securing Internet Protocol communications. When "A" and "B" share a password, they may use a password-authenticated key agreement form of Diffie-Hellman.

Runtime

In computer science, runtime or run time describes the operation of a computer program, the duration of its execution, from beginning to termination. 

The term runtime can also refer to a virtual machine to manage a program written in a computer language while it is running. 

Run time is sometimes used to mean runtime library, a library of basic code that is used by a particular compiler but when used in this fashion, runtime library is more accurate.

A runtime environment is a virtual machine state which provides software services for processes or programs while a computer is running. 

Runtime activities include loading and linking of the classes needed to execute a program, optional machine code generation and dynamic optimization of the program, and actual program execution.

For example, a program written in Java calls for services from the Java Runtime Environment by issuing commands from which the expected result is returned by the Java Runtime. By providing these services, the Java Runtime Environment is considered the runtime environment of the program. Both the program and the Java Runtime Environment request services from the operating system. The operating system kernel provides services for itself and all processes and software running under its control. The Operating System may be considered as providing a runtime environment for itself.

Java Virtual Machine

A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a set of computer software programs and data structures which use a virtual machine model for the execution of other computer programs and scripts. The model used by a JVM accepts a form of computer intermediate language commonly referred to as Java bytecode. 

Java Virtual Machines operate on Java bytecode, which is normally (but not necessarily) generated from Java source code; a JVM can also be used to implement programming languages other than Java. 

The JVM is an important component of the Java Platform. Because JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms, Java can be both middleware and a platform in its own right — hence the expression "write once, run anywhere." The use of the same bytecode for all platforms allows Java to be described as "compile once, run anywhere", as opposed to "write once, compile anywhere", which describes cross-platform compiled languages.

Station-to-Station protocol

The Station-to-Station (STS) protocol is a cryptographic key agreement scheme based on the classic Diffie-Hellman key exchange that provides mutual key and entity (party) authentication.

In addition to protecting the established key from an attacker, the STS protocol uses no timestamps and provides perfect forward secrecy. It also requires two-way explicit key confirmation, making it an "Authenticated key agreement with Key Confirmation" (Acronym: AKC) protocol.

STS was originally presented in 1987 in the context of ISDN security , finalized in 1989 and generally presented by Whitfield Diffie, Paul C. van Oorschot and Michael J. Wiener in 1992.

Internet Key Exchange

Internet Key Exchange (IKE or IKEv2) is the protocol used to set up a security association (SA) in the IPsec protocol suite. IKE uses a Diffie-Hellman key exchange to set up a shared session secret, from which cryptographic keys are derived. Public key techniques or, alternatively, a pre-shared key, are used to mutually authenticate the communicating parties.

IKE builds upon the Oakley protocol.

IKE was originally defined in November 1998 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in a series of publications (Request for Comments) known as RFC 2407, RFC 2408, and RFC 2409. 

IKE was updated to version two (IKEv2) in December 2005 by RFC 4306. IKEv2 has been further expanded by RFC 4301 (Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol) through RFC 4310 (DNS Security Extensions Mapping for the EPP). More RFCs are being added all the time as the need arises to further develop the features of the protocol.

The parent organization of the IETF ,The Internet Society (ISOC), has maintained the copyrights of these standards as being freely available to the Internet community.


The following Open Source implementations of IKEv2 are currently available:

Shared secret

In cryptography, a shared secret is a piece of data only known to the parties involved in a secure communication. The shared secret can be a password, a passphrase, a big number or an array of randomly chosen bytes.

The shared secret is either shared before parties start to communicate; in this case it can also be called a pre-shared key. Or it is created at the start of the communication session by using a key-agreement protocol, for-instance using public-key cryptography such as Diffie-Hellman or using symmetric-key cryptography such as Kerberos.

The shared secret can be used for authentication (for instance when logging in to a remote system) using methods such as challenge-response or it can be fed to a key derivation function to produce one or more keys to use for encryption and/or MACing of messages.

To make unique session and message keys the shared secret is usually combined with an initialization vector (IV). An example of this is the derived unique key per transaction method.

Pre-shared key

In cryptography, a pre-shared key or PSK is a shared secret which was previously shared between the two parties using some secure channel before it is used. Such systems almost always use symmetric key cryptographic algorithms. 

The characteristics of this secret or key are determined by the system which uses it; some system require that such keys be in a specific format. It can be a password like 'bret13i', a passphrase like 'Idaho hung gear id gene', or a hexadecimal string like '65E4 E556 8622 EEE1'. The secret is used by all systems involved in the cryptographic processes used to secure the traffic between the systems. 

The term is used in Wi-Fi encryption such as WEP or WPA, where both the wireless access points (AP) and all clients "share" the same key. 

Since one weakpoint of the crypto system is the encryption algorithm's key, the key strength is important, and since the strength of a key is in part dependent on the key length, it is important to choose a key whose length is cryptographically secure (see password strength). There are several tools available to help one choose a strong key. The Diceware method is one example.

IPsec

Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a way of making Internet communications more secure and private.

IPsec is a collection of protocols for securing Internet Protocol (IP) communications by authenticating (and optionally encrypting) each of a data stream. IPsec also includes protocols for establishing mutual authentication between agents at the beginning of the session and negotiation of cryptographic keys to be used during the session. IPsec can be used to protect data flows between a pair of hosts (e.g. computer users or servers), between a pair of security gateways (e.g. routers or firewalls), or between a security gateway and a host. RFC 2406

IPsec is an end-to-end security solution and operates at the Internet Layer of the Internet Protocol Suite, comparable to Layer 3 in the OSI model. Other Internet security protocols in widespread use, such as SSL, TLS and SSH, operate in the upper layers of these models. This makes IPsec more flexible, as it can be used for protecting all the higher level protocols, because applications do not need to be designed to use IPsec, whereas the use of TLS/SSL or other higher-layer protocols must be built-in the application.

The term "IPsec" is officially defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This definition includes the form of capitalization used for the term; it is often incorrectly spelled "IPSec".

1770–1779 Atlantic hurricane seasons

The decade of 1770s featured the 1770–1779 Atlantic hurricane seasons. While info for every storm that happened is not available, some parts of the coastline were had enough people to give info of hurricane happenings. Each season was an ongoing event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic basin. Most tropical cyclone formation is between June 1 and November 30.

No storm were reported.

No storms were reported.

A westward moving hurricane hit Puerto Rico on August 28. It continued through the Greater Antilles, hitting Hispaniola on the 30th and later Jamaica. It moved northwestward through the Gulf of Mexico, and hit just west of Mobile, Alabama on the 4th. Many ships were destroyed in the Mobile area, and its death toll is at least 280 deaths. This storm was famously described by Alexander Hamilton, who was living on Saint Croix at the time, and wrote a letter about it to his father. The letter was so dramatic and moving that it was published in newspapers in New York, and locals raised money to have him brought to the American colonies to receive a formal education. The letter included:

Honored Sir,
I take up my pen, just to give you an imperfect account of one of the most dreadful hurricanes that memory or any records whatever can trace, which happened here on the 31st ultimo at night. It began about dusk, at north, and raged very violently till ten o'clock. Then ensued a sudden and unexpected interval which lasted about an hour. Meanwhile the wind was shifting round to the south west point , from whence it returned with redoubled fury and continued till nearly three in the morning. Good God! what horror and destruction - it's impossible for me to describe - or you to form any idea of it. It seemed as if a total dissolution of nature was taking place. The roaring of the sea and wind - fiery meteors flying about in the air - the prodigious glare of almost perpetual lightning - the crash of falling houses - and the ear-piercing shrieks of the distressed were sufficient to strike astonishment into Angels. A great part of the buildings throughout the island are leveled to the ground - almost all the rest very much shattered - several persons killed and numbers utterly ruined - whole families wandering about the streets, unknowing where to find a place of shelter - the sick exposed to the keenness of water and air - without a bed to lie upon - or a dry covering to their bodies - and our harbors entirely bare. In a word, misery, in its most hideous shapes, spread over the whole face of the country ... 

While the previous hurricane was moving through the Caribbean, a tropical storm was moving northward in the Western Atlantic, hitting North Carolina on September 1. It forced fourteen vessels ashore, and fifty people perished in the storm.

Three hurricanes affected St. Kitts and Nevis in 1772. It is not known whether or not any of them were related to the above storms. "Nevis had scarcely a house left standing" after the first storm, and the worst one, on August 31. On St. Kitts, the damage was considerable. Once again, many houses were flattened, and there were several fatalities and many more injuries. Total damage from the storm was estimated at 500,000 pound sterling on St. Kitts. The second storm struck just three days later.

I. On August 26, a hurricane was reported in Virginia. It created much damage to area vessels (Virginia Gazette from September 2, 1773).

II. A 3-day rain event struck southeast Virginia from September 30 to October 2. North to northeast winds were experienced across the region.

I. August 24-25 saw an "August northeaster" bear down on Westmoreland County in Virginia. Rainy conditions were seen throughout the two-day period (from Journal & Letters of Philip Vickers Fithian p. 177).

II. The Maryland capitol building in Annapolis saw roof damage from a hurricane that began on September 3 and lasted about 24 hours (from Annapolis: A Walk Through History p. 77). A "stormy" northeast wind was seen in Westmoreland County Virginia, along with a "flood of rain" (from Journal & Letters of Philip Vickers Fithian p. 183-184).

On August 29, a hurricane hit the Outer Banks of North Carolina. It turned northeastward and left the state on the 2nd, bringing heavy wind and rain to southeastern Virginia. The hurricane stuck the eastern coast of Newfoundland on September 9, 1775. Approximately 4000 sailors, mostly from England and Ireland, were reported to have been drowned; a localized, storm surge is reported to have reached heights of between 20 and 30 feet.
The hurricane, also known as the Independence Hurricane, is Canada's deadliest natural disaster, as well as the eighth deadliest hurricane in history. A total of 4163 people died in this hurricane.

A hurricane moved through the Caribbean Sea in late July.

On November 2, a hurricane hit the Caicos Islands. "During a hurricane...at least eleven merchantmen and several English warships were lost in the Windward Passage near the Caicos Islands."

A hurricane moving northward through the Carolinas affected a Revolutionary War battle in Virginia; it caused supply ships to sink in the Chesapeake Bay area, and resulted in moderate damage to the area.

A powerful hurricane hit Martinique on September 5. It hit Pointe-a-Pitre Bay, Guadeloupe the next day, and caused 6000 fatalities.

One Spanish ship was sunk from a hurricane that moved off the Florida coast in June. No one was recovered.

Five ships were lost in a hurricane that moved across the Central Atlantic on September 10.

On August 12, a hurricane prevented a naval battle between the British and French in the Revolutionary War, causing them to separate as the hurricane moved up the coast.

Between October 28 and the 31st, a hurricane moved across Cuba, with most lives lost due to drowning.

A late season hurricane, possibly related to the previous hurricane, hit Cape Cod, Massachusetts on November 1. It caused 50-70 deaths.

All but one ship in a Spanish fleet of warships were sunk off the coast of Louisiana from a hurricane that hit on August 18. When it hit New Orleans, Louisiana on the 18th, it pushed the ships in the harbor well inland, causing heavy damage. William Dunbar first theorized from this system that a hurricane revolved around a vortex in the center.

A hurricane hit Martinique on August 28th, of which "many lives were lost".

After the season ended on December 3, a hurricane moved up the Atlantic coast, causing 120 deaths.

Records from ship logs have determined both 1815 and 1816 were active hurricane seasons, with at least 12 tropical cyclones ascribed to 1816 alone. This is some evidence that a northward-displaced Intertropical Convergence Zone appears to be partially responsible for the increased 1816 tropical cyclone activity. 

I. June 5-8: A hurricane brushed the Florida Keys, causing the loss of 5 ships. Interestingly, it appears to have been lured northward by an unusual June snowstorm across New England .

II. Haiti, around Port-au-Prince, was struck by a hurricane on August 18th .

I. A hurricane was first observed near Tobago on August 1 before continuing through the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico by August 6. It crossed over Florida, and when it reached the western Atlantic, it paralleled the coastlines of Georgia and South Carolina. It moved inland over southern North Carolina, and brought heavy rain to the Norfolk, Virginia area, delaying mail delivery and causing flooding through the mid-Atlantic as it moved northward into Pennsylvania by August 9. Its track appears similar to that of Hurricane Charley of August 2004.

II. Barbados was struck by a hurricane on October 21, causing 250 deaths as it moved through the Lesser Antilles. The hurricane subsequently moved into Nicaragua by October 26. 

I. A hurricane passed through the central Atlantic east of Bermuda to south and east of the Azores between August 26 and September 5. It reportedly silted at Hamilton Harbor on Bermuda. (from Beware the Hurricane)

The hurricane intensified to a Category 2-3 before hitting Galveston, Texas on September 12 and continuing onward to Mississippi. The hurricane was "quite severe", destroying all but six houses on Galveston Island.

III. A tropical cyclone seriously affected Puerto Rico on September 22. It possibly recurved sharply offshore the Eastern Seaboard, as the frigate Macedonian encountered a hurricane on the 26th and 27th to the east-northeast of Bermuda. The breeze freshened that afternoon as the ship lay near 35.6N 55.7W. By sunset, waves increased to nine feet, and southeast gales lashed the system after midnight on the 27th. Winds continued to increase into that afternoon, as seas increased to . One man fell overboard by 5 p.m. and drowned. The hurricane reached its full violence by 10 p.m., splitting the storm staysails, and making the rigging useless. The main mast cracked under the strain by 2 a.m. on the 28th, and the mizzenmast followed suit by 4 a.m.. Seawater poured into the ship from all sides, as the wooden hull twisted under the force of the waves. The ship finally cleared the storm without capsizing by noon, and finally got to see a sunset by the evening of the 29th (from Chronicles of the Frigate Macedonian 1809-1922 p. 129-139).

IV. An October 12-14 hurricane affected Jamaica and the central Bahamas. 

V. Between November 6 and November 13, another hurricane moved across the southwest Caribbean Sea into Jamaica and Cuba. 

The exact origin of this hurricane is unknown, but it likely formed off the coast of Cuba before heading on a west-northwest track towards the Gulf Coast. A small hurricane, it reached an estimated Category 3-4 strength before making landfall on July 27 in southeastern Louisiana, bringing heavy winds and a 5-6ft storm surge. The hurricane continued northeastward, making a second landfall in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi before dissipating inland. Known as one of the most destructive hurricanes to affect the United States during the first half of the 19th century, the Bay St. Louis Hurricane caused severe damage across Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, leaving behind the remains of shattered buildings and uprooted trees. Several vessels (from small boats to 60-ton brigs) were driven ashore by the hurricane's storm surge. One of them was the capsizing of the U.S. warship Firebrand, drowning 39 sailors. Several U.S. solders were caught off guard by the hurricane and perished in its midst. There were also reports of people being attacked by alligators, snapping turtles, and snakes, which further added to the death toll. The hurricane caused over $100,000 dollars (1819 US dollars) in damage, and killed between 43 to 175 people, some of them later found washed up across the Gulf Coast.

II. A tropical storm hit between New Orleans and Apalachicola in September.

III. Between September 19 and September 26, a hurricane tracked through the northeast Lesser Antilles and southwest of Bermuda. During September 21 and September 22, this hurricane hit the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, causing heavy damage and loss of life. 

IV. From October 13 to October 15, a hurricane passed through the Leeward Islands.

V. A hurricane is recorded to have impacted Cuba on October 27 before moving onward to the Bahamas on October 28.

It washed out all bridges between Darien and Savannah. Moving northward, it hit Savannah and South Carolina before going out to sea. Because hurricanes were somewhat frequent, residents were used to evacuating the area. Those who did not evacuate saw the destruction caused by this strong hurricane. This is likely one of the strongest hurricanes to hit Georgia in its history.

II. Between September 26 and September 27, a tropical storm moved south of Jamaica. 

I. A tropical storm formed south of Santo Domingo on May 28. It moved across Cuba on the 1st, and while moving across Florida it caused heavy winds.

III. This hurricane moved through the northern Leeward Islands a week after the last storm on August 27 before continuing westward into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, recurving northward to strike northwest Florida by September 5.

IV. A tropical storm moved through the southwest Atlantic between the West Indies and Bermuda from August 29 to September 8. 

A hurricane moved from the northern Lesser Antilles on September 15 northward by Bermuda on September 19, where it caused a "severe gale" and sank 3 ships, before moving into the north Atlantic shipping lanes. and from "Beware the Hurricane!"

I. A tropical storm moved through the Gulf of Mexico between July 9 and July 13.

II. A strong tropical storm moved through South Carolina and the Outer Banks of North Carolina before moving northwest of Bermuda during the last week of August.

1830–1839 Atlantic hurricane seasons

I. A hurricane moved from Trinidad to western Cuba between August 3 and August 9.

II. First noted in the Leeward Islands on August 11, a hurricane moved into the Caribbean in the middle of August. It moved west-northwestward, and approached the coast of Florida. It came close to present-day Daytona Beach on August 15, but recurved northeastward before landfall, although land was not spared from effects. It made landfall near Cape Fear on the 16th and went out to sea that night, eventually well to the north of Bermuda just offshore the Canadian Maritimes. The hurricane broke a three month drought, but caused heavy crop damage in the process.

III. A hurricane tracked north of the Leeward Islands on August 19 through the southwest and western Atlantic by August 26.

IV. A hurricane moved from north of Puerto Rico on September 29 to well northeast of Bermuda on October 1.

V. A tropical storm struck South Carolina on October 6. 

I. A tropical storm made landfall in northeast Florida on June 10.

II. A hurricane moved from south of Barbados to the Yucatán Peninsula between June 22 and June 28.

III. The Great Barbados Hurricane was an intense Category 4 hurricane that left cataclysmic damage across the Caribbean and Louisiana in 1831. It left 2,500 people dead and $7 million dollars (1831 dollars) in damage.

IV. A strong tropical storm/hurricane struck western Louisiana between August 27 and August 30.

V. A hurricane hit near the mouth of the Rio Grande, causing heavy rain over Texas and Mexico.

I. Early in the season, a hurricane moved through the Bahamas around June 5, causing 52 deaths. The gale began June 6 at 8 p.m. at Bermuda from the northeast, with the center passing quite close to the island as the wind shifted to southwest at 10:30 p.m. The storm lasted until 3 a.m. on June 7. Two schooners were damaged during the system. (from Beware the Hurricane)

II. On August 12, this hurricane was noted near Key West. The cyclone moved across the eastern Gulf of Mexico striking northwest Florida, then recurving through the Southeast to move through South Carolina by August 18.

III. On August 21 a tropical storm was witnessed to the west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands in the eastern tropical Atlantic.

IV. Between August 23 and August 27, a hurricane moved from the central Leeward Islands to the east of Jamaica.

V. On October 14, a tropical storm moved into South Carolina. 

A hurricane passed offshore of Norfolk in late August, keeping ships at harbor but causing no damage.

I. On September 4 a hurricane hit South Carolina, causing 37 deaths. It moved through North Carolina and Virginia, capsizing the ship "E. Pluribus Unum". The crew made it safely to shore.

II. A hurricane struck the island of Dominica on September 20, bringing heavy winds and a 12ft storm surge that devastated the capital of Roseau; 230 people are believed to have been killed by the hurricane's onslaught. Then the hurricane made its second landfall at Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic on the 23rd. About 170 sailors died when their ships sank in the Ozama River. On land the hurricane disrupted the funeral service of Padre Ruiz, a Roman Catholic priest. A total of 400 people were killed from the hurricane.

III. Also in September, a hurricane hit south Texas, causing heavy damage.

A hurricane was first detected near Antigua on August 12. It moved over Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and Cuba, causing at least 3 casualties. It moved across the Florida Straits and the Gulf of Mexico, hitting near the mouth of the Rio Grande on August 18. There, it destroyed small villages, caused strong storm surge, and killed 18 people.

Jay Barnes in "Florida's Hurricane History" pg 56, noted a hurricane, possibly the same, that smashed Cape Florida and Key Biscayne, creating the Norris Cut and knocking over the Ponce de Leon lighthouse. From there, the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico and took a hard northeast tack, damaging Fort Brooke in Tampa, terrorizing the city, and then ambling northward into Georgia and the Carolinas, making the trip "all the way into New England."

A hurricane hit the Cayman Islands during this season.

I. On July 26 a storm hit Martinique. It caused 57 deaths.

II. On August 2, a hurricane hit Puerto Rico, causing 141 deaths.

III. A tropical system was observed east of the West Indies on August 13. It moved through the islands, and passed the Bahamas on the 16th. As it was recurving, it hit the North Carolina coast on the 18th. It slowly moved over land, causing 48 hours of strong winds, and moved offshore on the 20th. This is known as the Calypso Hurricane.

IV. The 10th known tropical storm in the 1837 season, nicknamed Racer's Storm, was first observed in the Western Caribbean during late September. It moved across the Yucatán Peninsula and the western Gulf of Mexico, where it hit Brownsville, Texas on October 2.

II. A late season hurricane hit the east coast of Mexico on November 1, sinking 2 U.S. ships.

I. A hurricane hit Charleston, South Carolina on August 28. It passed over North Carolina and Virginia before going out to sea on the 30th.

II. This cyclone is known as Reid's Hurricane. The system moved from east of the West Indies into the southwest Atlantic. Swells were noted as early as September 9 at Bermuda. During late on the September 11 and early on September 12, this hurricane struck Bermuda. The storm tide was measured as 11 feet/3.3 meters. Thousands of trees were downed. The tower on Tower Hill was levelled. Damage done to private property totalled 8000 pounds sterling (1839 pounds). This cyclone later swept western Ireland as an extratropical storm, which they called The Great Wind of 1839. This was one of the first hurricanes to be studied by William Reid in person, in this case as governor of the island the year after his publication of "The Law of Storms". (from Beware the Hurricane)

III. During the middle of September, a hurricane approached the coast of Louisiana. It struck near Lake Charles, then known as Charley's Lake, on September 15.

IV. A late season hurricane hit Galveston, Texas on November 5.

Jigglypuff

Jigglypuff is one of the 493 fictional species of Pokémon from the "Pokémon" media franchise owned by Nintendo and Game Freak. Since it was introduced early in the "Pokémon" anime, it has become one of the most famous Pokémon. 

Jigglypuff is perhaps most famous for the song it sings which puts everyone who hears it into a deep sleep. Jigglypuff then becomes upset because it assumes everyone is very bored by the song, and it draws all over their faces with a marker.

Jigglypuff is a small Pokémon, slightly shorter than Pikachu. It is shaped like a balloon and has a pink body with blue eyes, catlike ears, and a strange tuft of fur on its forehead.

In the "Pokémon" video games, Jigglypuff is famous among players because it learns the move Sing, which puts enemy Pokémon to sleep. This often causes them to lose the battle, and many players find it very annoying.

Jigglypuff was introduced in "Pokémon Red and Blue", the first "Pokémon" games. It has appeared in most of the games since then. It evolves into Wigglytuff, an "upgraded" form of Jigglypuff. Starting with "Pokémon Gold and Silver", Jigglypuff has a pre-evolved evolutionary form, Igglybuff. Igglybuff was one of the 100 new Pokémon introduced in "Gold" and "Silver". Previously there were only 151.

Jigglypuff has also appeared in "Super Smash Bros.," "Super Smash Bros. Melee", and "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" as a light and fast character. Its attacks include Rollout, Pound, Sing, Rest, and its Final Smash, Puff Up.

Jigglypuff is one of the most famous Pokémon, alongside Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Mewtwo, mostly because it has appeared many times in the still-running "Pokémon" anime. It usually appears unexpectedly and puts Pokémon and humans near it to sleep for a few minutes by singing its trademark song. It has a black permanent marker, similar to a Sharpie, with which it often draws on people and Pokémon's faces while they are asleep. This is an act of revenge, because everyone falls asleep when they hear Jigglypuff's song and Jigglypuff assumes it's because they are very bored by it. Since people are upset when Jigglypuff puts them to sleep, and Jigglypuff is upset when they fall asleep, it is a vicious circle.

In one episode, a Jigglypuff was trapped in a Blastoise's cannon. When it finally escaped, it put everyone to sleep and drew on their faces.

Muhammad al-Qaim Bi-Amrillah

Muhammad al-Qaim Bi-Amrillah (893 - 17 May, 946) () was the second Caliph of the Fatimids in Ifriqiya and ruled from 934 to 946. He is the 12th Imam according to Isma'ili Faatemi faith.

Al-Qaim (sometimes also spelled Ka'im) was born in Salamya in Syria in 895 with the name Abd ar-Rahman. After his father Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah (910-934) seized power in Ifriqiya he was named heir to the throne in 912, and helped put down several revolts. But campaigns into Egypt failed because of the resistance of the Abbasids (914-915 and 919-921).

In 934 Al-Qaim succeeded his father as Caliph. The Fatimid realm became an important power in the Mediterranean. After the re-conquest of Sicily the Byzantine province of Calabria and the coast of Italy and France were . 

But from 944 to 947 there was a crisis by the revolt of Abu Yazid, who had united the Kharijite Berber tribes of eastern Algeria and overrun Ifriqiya. Imam Al-Qaim was able to hold out in Mahdia with the help of the navy for over a year, but died (17 May 946) before the revolt could be put down. 

He was succeeded by his son Ismail al-Mansur (946-953).
He died on 13 th Shawwal 334 AH (Mahdiyya)/ 17th May 946 AD

Anti-nuclear movement

Many people who are anti-nuclear, are against the use of nuclear power for electricity generation, since they think nuclear power is dangerous. They consider the risk of a nuclear accident unacceptable and generally believe that radioactive waste cannot be disposed of safely. Many also see uranium mining and nuclear reprocessing as bad, because of the environmental risks of these activities. The 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents have "revived anti-nuclear passions worldwide, putting governments on the defensive and undermining the nuclear power industry's recent renaissance".

Anti-nuclear groups believe that nuclear power is a risk to people and the environment. These include health risks and environmental damage from uranium mining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation, the unsolved problem of nuclear waste, and the possibility of further serious accidents. Anti-nuclear critics see nuclear power as a dangerous, expensive way to boil water to generate electricity.

Opponents of nuclear energy make connections between the international export and development of nuclear power technologies and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The facilities and expertise to produce nuclear power can be readily adapted to produce nuclear weapons. Greenpeace suggests that nuclear power and nuclear weapons have grown up like Siamese twins. 

Nuclear power plants are very expensive. Making reliable cost estimates is difficult, and estimates for new reactors in the USA range from $5 billion to $10 billion per unit. Building nuclear plants is seen to be "a risky business", according to several notable credit rating agencies and investment analysts. 

Nuclear accidents are often cited by anti-nuclear groups as evidence of the inherent danger of nuclear power. The most well-known nuclear accident, a mishandled safety test at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986 in Kiev, Ukraine, "killed at least 4056 people and damaged almost $7 billion of property". Radioactive fallout from the accident concentrated near Belarus, Ukraine and Russia and at least 350,000 people were forcibly resettled away from these areas. After the accident, "traces of radioactive deposits unique to Chernobyl were found in nearly every country in the northern hemisphere". Other serious nuclear accidents include the Mayak disaster, Soviet submarine K-431 accident, Soviet submarine K-19 accident, Chalk River accidents, Windscale fire, Church Rock Uranium Mill Spill and the SL-1 accident. 

Especially since the September 11 attacks, people have become concerned that terrorists or criminals could bomb a nuclear plant and release radioactive material. Building more plants would create more targets to protect.

There is an international consensus that spent nuclear fuel should be stored in deep geological disposal sites. However, no country has opened such a site yet. The demise of the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada leaves the USA with no plan for the long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel.

Anti-nuclear groups generally claim that reliance on nuclear energy can be reduced by adopting energy conservation and energy efficiency measures. Energy efficiency can reduce the consumption of energy while providing the same level of energy "services".

Anti-nuclear groups also favour the use of renewable energy, such as wind power, solar power, geothermal energy and biofuel. According to the International Energy Agency, renewable energy technologies are essential contributors to the energy supply portfolio, as they contribute to world energy security and provide opportunities for mitigating greenhouse gases.

Australia has no nuclear power stations and the current Gillard Labor government is opposed to nuclear power for Australia, as are the Greens, the party with the current balance of power in the upper house. However, Australia does have a small research reactor (OPAL) in Sydney, and it does export uranium. Australia has 40% of the world's known uranium deposits as well as similar deposits of the other potential fission reactor fuel thorium, and sells uranium to members of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 

Uranium mining and export and nuclear issues have often been the subject of public debate, and the anti-nuclear movement in Australia has a long history. It all began with the 1972–73 debate over French nuclear testing in the Pacific, which involved several groups, and the 1976–77 debate about uranium mining in Australia.

In the 1970s, an anti-nuclear movement in France, consisting of citizens' groups and political action committees, emerged. There were many large anti-nuclear protests and demonstrations. More recently, targeted campaigns have been conducted, mainly by Greenpeace, and Sortir du nucléaire (France) has called for an official safety inspection of Areva facilities. 

The anti-nuclear movement in Germany has a long history dating back to the early 1970s, when large demonstrations prevented the construction of a nuclear plant at Wyhl. Anti-nuclear success at Wyhl inspired nuclear opposition throughout Germany, in other parts of Europe, and in North America.

In January 2008 the UK government announced plans to build new nuclear power stations, and the anti-nuclear movement in the United Kingdom has voiced concerns. There are also public concerns about the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Many different groups and individuals have been involved in demonstrations and protests over the years.

For many years the anti-nuclear movement in the United States succeeded in delaying or halting commitments to build some new nuclear plants. Anti-nuclear campaigns that captured national public attention in the 1970s involved the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, Diablo Canyon Power Plant, Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, and the Three Mile Island accident. More recent targeted campaigning has related to the Indian Point Energy Center, Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station, Salem Nuclear Power Plant, Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant, Idaho National Laboratory, proposed Yucca Mountain waste repository, the Hanford Site, the Nevada Test Site, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and transportation of nuclear waste from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Many different groups have been involved in various protests and demonstrations over the years.

More than fifty anti-nuclear groups are operating, or have operated, in the United States. These include: Abalone Alliance, Clamshell Alliance, Greenpeace USA, Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, Musicians United for Safe Energy, Nevada Desert Experience, Nuclear Control Institute, Nuclear Information and Resource Service, Public Citizen Energy Program, Shad Alliance, and the Sierra Club. 

Many well-known scientists and engineers have expressed reservations about nuclear power. These people include: Barry Commoner, S. David Freeman, John Gofman, Amory Lovins, Arjun Makhijani, Gregory Minor and Joseph Romm.

On April 21, 2010, a dozen environmental groups called on the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission to investigate possible problems in the AP1000 reactor design.

On April 24, 2010, about 120,000 people built a human chain (KETTENreAKTION!) between the nuclear plants at Krümmel and Brunsbüttel. In this way they were protesting against the plans of the German government to extend the period of producing nuclear power.

In May 2010, some 25,000 people, including members of peace organizations and 1945 atomic bomb survivors, marched for about two kilometers from downtown New York to a square in front of United Nations headquarters, calling for the end to nuclear weapons.

In September 2010, German government policy shifted back toward nuclear energy, and this created some new anti-nuclear sentiment in Berlin and beyond. On September 18, 2010, tens of thousands of Germans surrounded Chancellor Angela Merkel’s office in an anti-nuclear demonstration that organisers said was the biggest of its kind since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. 

In October 2010, tens of thousands of people protested in Munich against the nuclear power policy of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government. The action was the biggest anti-nuclear event in Bavaria for more than two decades.

In November 2010, there were violent protests against a train carrying reprocessed nuclear waste in Germany. Tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Dannenberg to signal their opposition to the cargo. Around 16,000 police were mobilised to deal with the protests.

In December 2010, some 10,000 people (mainly fishermen, farmers and their families) turned out to oppose the Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project in western Maharashtra state in India, amid a heavy police presence.

In December 2010, five anti-nuclear weapons activists, including octogenarians and Jesuit priests, were convicted of conspiracy and trespass in Tacoma, USA. They cut fences at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor in 2009 to protest submarine nuclear weapons, and reached an area near where Trident nuclear warheads are stored in bunkers. Members of the group could face up to 10 years in prison when they are sentenced.

In January 2011, five Japanese young people held a hunger strike for more than a week, outside the Prefectural Government offices in Yamaguchi City, to protest site preparation for the planned Kaminoseki Nuclear Power Plant near the environmentally sensitive Seto Inland Sea.

Following the Fukushima I nuclear accidents, anti-nuclear opposition intensified in Germany. On 12 March 2011, 60,000 Germans formed a 45-km human chain from Stuttgart to the Neckarwestheim power plant. On 14 March, 110,000 people protested in 450 other German towns, with opinion polls indicating 80% of Germans opposed the government's extension of nuclear power. On March 15, 2011, Angela Merkel said that seven nuclear power plants which went online before 1980 would be temporarily closed and the time would be used to study speedier renewable energy commercialization.

In March 2011, around 2,000 anti-nuclear protesters demonstrated in Taiwan for an immediate end to the construction of the island's fourth nuclear power plant. The protesters were also opposed to plans to extend the lifespan of three existing nuclear plants.

In March 2011, more than 200,000 people took part in anti-nuclear protests in four large German cities, on the eve of state elections. Organisers called it the biggest anti-nuclear demonstration the country has seen. Thousands of Germans demanding an end to the use of nuclear power took part in nationwide demonstrations on 2 April 2011.

After the Fukushima I nuclear accidents, environmental activists at a U.N. meeting in April 2011 "urged bolder steps to tap renewable energy so the world doesn't have to choose between the dangers of nuclear power and the ravages of climate change".

In mid-April, 17,000 people protested at two demonstrations in Tokyo against nuclear power.

In India, environmentalists, local farmers and fishermen have been protesting for months over the planned Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project six-reactor complex, 420km south of Mumbai. If built, it would be one of the world's largest nuclear power complexes. Protests have escalated in the wake of Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster and during two days of violent rallies in April 2011, a local man was killed and dozens were injured.

Fallout 3

Fallout 3 is an action/role-playing game computer game. It was created by Bethesda Game Studios. The game is the third in the "Fallout" series of games. It is set in a world where nuclear bombs have ruined the surface and people are fighting to survive. "Fallout 3" was released on October 28, 2008 in North America, October 30, 2008 in Australia, and October 31, 2008 in the United Kingdom.

The player controls a character on the screen with two different view points. One point of view is from the character's head and another is from behind the character. The player may make their character different by changing their name, gender, how they look, and using skill points to make their character better at doing certain things. 

The character may use either close-up weapons, guns or grenades to fight enemies. These need to be repaired in order to stay good. The player can also create weapons using drawings found in the game. There are two modes of fighting. The player may either aim and shoot at enemies or use a special system, called the "Vault-tec Assisted Targeting System" (VATS), to attack an enemy's arms and legs. 

The character has a limited number of Health Points. If these are lost due to damage, the character will die. However, the player can dress their character in armor so that the character takes less damage. The character may also get sick from radiation.

The character can also be good or bad, and earns "Karma points" for being good and doing nice things or loses Karma points for being mean or killing people who do not deserve it.

Because of the nuclear war the world was radiated very badly. The people who were not safe turned into Ghouls, living zombies. The player also has to fight against Raiders, Super Mutants and animals like radiated cockroachs, scorpions, and vicious dogs.

Many normal people are alive, though. For example, a city made of airplane parts, "Megaton", has normal humans, "Tenpenny Tower" has wealthy people and "Paradise Falls" that has slaves and slavers. There is also a city made of Ghouls called "Underworld" which is an old museum.

In the "Fallout" games, the world after 2050 destroyed itself because all the nations bombed each other with nuclear bombs. A few people in the United States hid underground in shelters called "Vaults". The player comes from Vault 101 in Washington, D.C. They leave the vault because their father has gone missing.

The game does not have a required story as the player can play any missions, called "quests", whenever they want. The main story involves the player interacting with what used to be the Army, the Brotherhood of Steel, and the evil Enclave, which used to be the government.

In October 2008 though, brought the proposal back up, and also started working on a draft system. Input was soon found from the community, including and and the process began to take shape! Although it was based off en-wp, the aim from the start was to create something new and related to Simple Wikipedia.

Since creation, the system has had 5 successful updates, and can be seen on the Main Page. It was recently the subject of some controversy over how to format the suggestions and also whether or not it was too complex, but this has now been laid to rest. Discussions are now underway as to how to improve it both rules wise and also how to credit nominators.

Zwentendorf power plant

The Zwentendorf power plant is a nuclear power plant in Zwentendorf an der Donau in Austria. It has never been used. This is because the people of Austria voted against using it in 1978. 

Today, the plant is used to get replacement parts to other plants of the same type (mainly in Germany), and for staff training. It is not possible to visit the power plant. Because the nuclear power plant was never in use, a coal power plant was built in 1987 to replace it.

The plant is now owned by Austrian energy company and used as a Solar Power Plant.

Outside of Wikipedia, my main publication at the moment is Tramways Monthly.

I write articles for Simple News. I normally write about random things that have happened at Simple Wikipedia, and they often relate to things I am involved with, such as DYK?.

The QandA section, pilfered from as he left!

Just a section where I will add reserve or emergency content in the event that the publishing deadline gets close and we haven't got enough content.

Georges Cuvier

Baron Georges Léopold Chrétien Frédéric Dagobert Cuvier (23 August 1769–13 May 1832) was a French naturalist and zoologist. He was the older brother of Frédéric Cuvier (1773–1838), also a naturalist. He was a very important figure in scientific circles in Paris during the early 19th century and helped establish the fields of comparative anatomy and paleontology by comparing living animals with fossils. He is well known because he proved extinction was a fact. He was the most influential person believing in catastrophism in geology in the early 19th century. He opposed early evolutionary theories. His most famous work is the "Règne animal distribué d'après son organisation" (1817; translated into English as "The Animal Kingdom"). He died in Paris of cholera.

George W. Campbell

George Washington Campbell (February 9, 1769–February 17, 1848) was an American statesman. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives as the Representative from Tennessee's at-large congressional district in 1803. He served in the House from 1805-1809, in the 8th, 9th, and 10th Congresses. During the 10th Congress, he was the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. He was also one of the managers appointed in 1804 to conduct the impeachment hearings for John Pickering, judge of the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, and later in the same year, the impeachment hearings against Samuel Chase, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

Born in Scotland, he immigrated to North Carolina in 1772 with his parents. He graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1794 and began studying law. He was admitted to the bar in North Carolina and began practicing in Knoxville, Tennessee. 

He left Congress in 1809 to become judge of the Tennessee Supreme Court, serving until 1811.

He served as a United States Senator from Tennessee twice, once from 1811 to 1814, having been elected to fill the seat of Jenkin Whiteside, and again from 1815 to 1818. His first service was from October 8, 1811 to February 11, 1814, when he resigned to accept appointment as the United States Secretary of the Treasury. He returned to the Senate on October 10, 1815. He served as the first chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and its predecessor from December 4, 1815, until his resignation from the Senate on April 20, 1818; on this occasion to accept appointment as United States Ambassador to Russia, a position he held from 1818-1821. Campbell served as a member of the French Spoliation Claims Commission in 1831.

Appointed Secretary of the Treasury by James Madison, he faced national financial disorder brought on by the War of 1812. Congress had failed to recharter the First Bank of the United States after its charter expired in 1811, and appropriations for the war were unavailable, so Campbell had to convince Americans to buy government bonds. He was forced to meet to lenders terms, selling government bonds at exorbitant interest rates. In September, 1814 the British occupied Washington, D.C. and the credit of the government was lowered even further. Campbell was unsuccessful in his efforts to raise money through additional bond sales and he resigned that October after only eight months in office, disillusioned and in bad health.

He died in 1848 and is buried at Nashville City Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee.

Campbell County, Tennessee, is named in his honor.

Chloroform

Chloroform (also called trichloromethane) is a chemical substance. It is an organic compound. Chloroform is one of the intermediate substances that occur in the production of Polytetrafluoroethylene, better known as "Teflon". 

The first who reported to have produced Chloroform was the French chemist Eugène Soubeiran, in 1831. Soubeiran took acetone and ethanol, and used bleach powder for the reaction. The American physician Samuel Guthrie prepared gallons of the material and described its "deliciousness of flavor." Independently, Justus von Liebig also described it. Chloroform was named and chemically characterised in 1834 by Jean-Baptiste Dumas.

The main uses of Chloroform are:

Chloroform was used as an anaesthetic during childbirth and surgery, from about 1847. It replaced ether which was used before.
Chloroform is very poisonous, and can cause breathing problems, and problems with the heart. Death from chloroform can come from cardiac arrest. When Chloroform is stored for a longer time period, it can decay into Phosgene. Phosgene was a chemical weapon (poison gas) used during the First World War. Chloroform can cause birth defects and lead to miscarriages. It may cause cancer.

Arithmetic logic unit

In computing, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit that performs arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU is one of basic building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer, even the simplest microcontrollers contain one for purposes such as timing. 

Now, modern microprocessors, microcontrollers and CPUs have very powerful and very complex ALUs, also a CPU may contain up to more than 4 ALUs (see superscalar CPUs).

Mathematician John von Neumann proposed the ALU concept in 1945.

Floating point unit

A floating point unit (FPU) is a part of a computer system specially designed to carry out operations on floating point numbers. Typical operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root. 

Some systems can also perform more advanced functions as exponential or trigonometric functions calculations, however in most modern processors these functions are done with software library routines not by hardware.

In most modern general purpose CPUs, one or more FPUs are integrated inside the CPU; however many embedded microcontrollers, especially older designs, do not have hardware support for floating point operations. 

In the past, some systems as the Intel 8086 have implemented floating point via a coprocessor that is controlled by the CPU rather than as an integrated unit.

Most modern computers have integrated FPU hardware; but not all. In the absence of an FPU, many FPU functions can be emulated, which saves the added hardware cost of an FPU but is significantly slower.

Derealization (DR) is a change in the way someone views the world so that it seems unreal. Derealization can also make someone feel as if their environment does not have emotion or depth. This is a symptom of other problems, such as sleeping disorders, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. It can also be caused by drug intoxication.

Similar to derealization is depersonalization, but the two are different. Depersonalization is a sense of unreality about oneself. Derealization is a sense of unreality of the outside world.

Derealization often happens during a traumatic or tragic event.

Paresthesia (pron. ; paraesthesia in British English, pron. ) is a feeling of tingling, prickling, or numbness with no permanent effects. It is commonly called "pins and needles". This feeling may last a short while, or may be more long-lasting. A long-term effect means there is something wrong with neurons in the body.

An example of this can be felt when sitting cross-legged for a long time and your foot "falls asleep". The tingling feeling you get when you move is paresthesia.

Paresthesia has many known causes, including the following:

Perfectionism is the belief that one can and should be perfect. A person who believes this is called a "perfectionist". Perfectionists believe that anything less than perfect is unacceptable. While this can lead people to achieve great accomplishments and give people motivation, it is considered to be a mostly unhealthy belief. Perfectionism can lead to procrastination ("I can't do this project until I can do it the "right" way."). This can mean low productivity. Perfectionism may also cause low self-esteem and anxiety.

Women's suffrage

Women's suffrage refers to women fighting to gain the right to vote and to hold official office. Before 1893, no women had the right to have their say about how the country was run. In 1893, after Kate Sheppard and her work mates had been demonstrating and raising awareness of the suffragette's fight, New Zealand women were given the right to vote after parliament (which was all men) voted for it. Many countries followed soon after, following similar battles. Women like Susan Brownell Anthony helped to make women's rights come true. Emmeline Pankhurst was one of the many women who wanted to be able to vote and gain the same responsibilitys that men had. She believed that women and men were equal individuals. She was arrested frequently with one of her daughters Christabel. Emily Wilding Davison also believed very strongly about suffrage and went to the extreme of killing herself by standing in front of King George V's horse, called Anmer, at the Epsom Derby on June 4, 1913. She died a few days later, on June 8. In 1893, women in New Zealand were allowed to vote. By the 1920's most women could vote and, in 1970, the fist Swiss woman was voted prime minister. Still today, some Muslim countries will not allow women to vote, despite the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

The Grenfell area was the home of the Wiradjuri Aborigines. Europeans first settled when gold was found at Emu Creek. The town was renamed after John Grenfell, the Gold Commissioner at Forbes. He had been killed in 1866 when bushrangers attacked a stagecoach on which he was travelling.

By 1870-71 more gold was found at Grenfell than in any other town in NSW. By the middle of the 1870s the gold was running out. Wheat was first grown in the area in 1871. The railway reached Grenfell in 1901.

The Grenfell area has been badly affected by drought since 2001. 

The poet and story writer Henry Lawson was born on the gold fields at Grenfell. On the Queen's Birthday weekend in June every year, the town has "The Henry Lawson Festival of Arts". Thousands of people come from all over Australia for the art, poetry and writing competitions. Over the years, famous visitors have included Chips Rafferty, Barry Humphries, Patrick White and Sigrid Thornton.

In June 2007, the "Spirit of the Bush Concert" was held. It was organized by Australian of the Year, Lee Kernaghan, local and international star Steve Forde and the Flange, Adam Brand, Leo Sayer, Diesel, and The McClymonts.

Group (mathematics)

In mathematics, a group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with an operation. The operation is used to combine two elements to form a third element. There are a few rules the set and the operation must satisfy to qualify as a group. These are called group axioms:


One thing to note about groups is that it is not always the case that "a" • "b" = "b" • "a" for every "a" and "b" in the group. If a group does have the property that "a" • "b" = "b" • "a" we call it an "abelian" group.

The number of elements in a group is called its "order". 

One everyday example of a group is the set of integers and the addition operation. It is easy to see that when you add two integers, the result is always an integer. So closure is true. The identity element for this group is zero. Because the order of additions does not matter, associativity is true. And the inverse of any integer is its negative value. This group is also an abelian group. It has infinite order, because the integers are a countably infinite set.

Crich ( "kryech") is a village in the English county of Derbyshire. It is the home of the National Tramway Museum in the Crich Tramway Village. 

At the top of Crich Hill is a tower. The tower was built to remember members of the regiment who died in battle, particularly in World War I.

The tower was built in 1923 on the site of an older tower called Crich Stand. The Memorial Tower is the end of an annual pilgrimage on the first Sunday in July. It is above sea level. The tower has 52 steps to the top. From the top of the tower, eight counties and landmarks such as the "Humber Bridge" and Lincoln Cathedral can be seen.

Crich is mentioned in 1009 by Ethelred the Unready when he gives away Weston-on-Trent to his minister.

A workhouse opened in 1734 and had 40 people. The workhouse accepted poor people from places, including Melbourne, Pentrich, Willington, Mercaston and Denby.

The television series "Peak Practice" and the 2007 movie ""And When Did You Last See Your Father"" were filmed in Crich.

Edwardian period

The Edwardian period or Edwardian era in the United Kingdom is the period covering the reign of King Edward VII, 1901 to 1911. The period is often considered to extend beyond his death in 1910 to include the years up to the start of World War I in 1914. 

Queen Victoria had died in January 1901. While she had shunned society, Edward was the leader of a fashionable elite which set a style influenced by the art and fashions of continental Europe—perhaps because of the King's fondness for travel.

In the nineteenth century, the United Kingdom had seen great progress in science and industry. The British Empire was vast, and the British Navy was the most powerful in the world. Despite a growing threat from Germany, the Edwardians felt confident that progress would continue.

There was still a big gap in living standards between the rich and the poor. 
Most adult males had the right to vote, but women were still demanding this right. 

Primary education was compulsory. During this period, secondary education was made available to many more children, including those from working-class families.

King Edward had 2 older sister, Her name was Princess Vicky and princess lucy

Objectivity (philosophy)

Detached Objectivity is a philosophical method for a person separating their own ideas and opinions from the observations they make. Objective observations are true no matter who makes the observation. Being objective helps people focus on things that everyone can agree on. In science, being objective means you study things by making some kind of measurement, so your results are based on facts and not opinions.

The opposite of objectivity is subjectivity.

Flag of Australia

The flag of Australia is a national flag. In 1901, Australia became a single country, instead of six separate colonies. A competition was held to design a new flag for the new country. The winning flag has a blue background, the Union Jack, and six stars. Five stars are in the shape of the constellation the Southern Cross, the other is the Commonwealth Star. The flag has been used from 1903, but did not become the official flag of Australia until 1953.

On 29 April 1901, some private companies with the support of the Australian Government set up a competition to design a new flag for Australia. The prize money was ₤200 including ₤75 from a magazine and ₤50 from a tobacco company. There were 32,823 designs entered into the competition. These were put on show in Melbourne at the Royal Exhibition Building. The judges, from the army, navy, merchant navy, and pilot service, to choose the best flag were:
The judges took eight days to choose a winning flag.

Five flags were almost the same, and they shared first prize. The Prime Minister of Australia, Edmund Barton, announced the winners on 3 September 1901. The winners were:
The winning flag was flown from the top of the Exhibition Building. The Prime Minister Edmund Barton wrote to the Governor-General to get approval from the King for the new flag. This was officially announced on February 20, 1903. 

Some of the winning flags had different numbers of points on the stars of the Southern Cross. This was simplified to seven points for the four largest stars and five for the small one. The Commonwealth Star had six points for the six states. This was the design in 1903. In 1912, an extra point was added to the Commonwealth Star for the Territories of Australia. 
In 1934, the government published how the Australian flag should be made. The flag of the United Kingdom, the Union Jack was still the official flag in Australia until 1954. By law, only the Australian government was allowed to fly the blue Australian flag. Everyone else that wanted to use an Australian flag used the red one, called the Red Ensign. In 15 March 1941, the Prime Minister of Australia, Robert Menzies, gave permission for the blue flag to be used on public buildings, schools and by the public. Australian ships would use the Red Ensign.

In 1954, the Australian Flag became the official Australian National Flag. The Australian flag is the most important flag flown in Australia, and must be given more importance than flags from other countries. When it is raised or lowered people should face the flag and not talk. It should only be used properly, for example, it can not be used to cover a table or a seat, and it can not be allowed to touch the ground.

The Royal Australian Navy has had its own flag from 1 March 1967. This looks like the national flag but has a white background with blue stars, called the Australian White Ensign. The Royal Australian Air Force got its own flag in 1949. This was changed in 1981 to feature a red kangaroo.

The Queen of Australia has her own flag for use when she visits Australia. The Governor-General of Australia also has a flag which is flown from his or her official house and from his or her car.

The United States presidential election of 2004 was held on Tuesday, November 2, 2004, to elect the President of the United States. It was the 55th consecutive quadrennial election for President and Vice President. Republican Party candidate and the current President George W. Bush won against Democratic Party candidate John Kerry, the junior U.S. Senator from Massachusetts. Foreign policy was the biggest issue during the election campaign, as well as how Bush handled the War on Terrorism and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. 

As in the previous election, there were concerns about voting, and concerns of irregularities emerged during and after the vote. The winner was not determined until the following day, when Kerry decided not to dispute Bush's win in the state of Ohio. The state held enough electoral votes to determine the winner of the presidency. Both Kerry and Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean have stated their opinion that voting in Ohio did not proceed fairly and that, had it done so, the Democratic ticket might have won that state and therefore the election. 

Only three states changed allegiance. New Mexico and Iowa voted Democratic in 2000, but voted Republican in 2004. New Hampshire voted Republican in 2000 but voted Democratic in 2004. In the Electoral College, Bush received 286 votes, and Kerry 252.

Register renaming

In computer engineering, register renaming refers to a technique used to avoid unnecessary serialized execution of program instructions because of the reuse of the same registers by those instructions.

Programs are composed of instructions which operate on values. The instructions must name these values in order to distinguish them from one another. A typical instruction might say, add X and Y and put the result in Z. In this instruction, X, Y, and Z are the names of storage locations.

In order to have a compact instruction encoding, most processor instruction sets have a small set of special locations which can be directly named. For example, the x86 instruction set architecture has 8 integer registers, x86-64 has 16, many RISCs have 32, and IA-64 has 128. In smaller processors, the names of these locations correspond directly to elements of a register file.

Different instructions may take different amounts of time (e.g., CISC architecture). For instance, a processor may be able to execute hundreds of instructions while a single load from main memory instruction is in progress. Shorter instructions executed while the load is outstanding will finish first, thus the instructions are finishing out of the original program order. Out-of-order execution has been used in most recent high-performance CPUs to achieve some of their speed gains.

Consider this sequance of instructions running on an out-of-order CPU:

Instructions 4, 5, and 6 are independent of instructions 1, 2, and 3, but the processor cannot finish 4 until 3 is done, because 3 would then write the wrong value.

We can remove this restriction by changing the names of some of the registers:

Now instructions 4, 5, and 6 can be executed in parallel with instructions 1, 2, and 3, so that the program can be executed faster.

When possible, compilers do this renaming. But compilers are limited by the number of register inside the CPU. Many high performance CPUs have more physical registers than may be named directly in the instruction set and they can rename registers in hardware to achieve better instruction level parallelism.

Anything that is read and written can be renamed. While the general-purpose and floating-point registers are the most, flag and status registers or even individual status bits are commonly renamed as well.

Memory locations can also be renamed, although it is not commonly done to the level used in register renaming.

When more than one instruction references a particular location for an operand, either reading it (as an input) or writing it (as an output), executing those instructions in an order different from the original program order can cause to three kinds of problems, also known as hazards:

Formation and evolution of the Solar System

The formation and evolution of the Solar System is the name for the many ideas describing how the Solar System began and how it will carry on changing. The accepted idea is that 4.6 billion years ago, there was a very big cloud of gas in our area of space, known as a nebula. The Nebula eventually became so big that gravity pulled all the gas to the center. Eventually because of all the gas it became so hot there that some hydrogen atoms fused together to make helium. 

Scientists think that solar systems are created out of a huge cloud of gas. The process by which the solar systems are created is called the Nebular Theory.

As they did this a lot of energy was let out. All this energy eventually made our star: the Sun. The leftover gas created the Gas Giants-also known as Jovian Planets. The rock and dust went off to make the Rocky or Terrestrial planets, their moons, asteroids and all other objects in the Solar System.

Because of the sun's huge mass, it had very strong gravity that caused all of the surrounding celestial objects to stay in place an orbit around the sun.

The solar system was now formed.

Microarchitecture

In computer engineering, microarchitecture (sometime abbreviated to µarch or uarch) is a description of the electrical circuitry of a computer, central processing unit, or digital signal processor that is sufficient for completely describing the operation of the hardware. 

In academic circles, the term computer organization is used, while in the computer industry, the term microarchitecture is more often used. Microarchitecture and instruction set architecture (ISA) together constitute the field of computer architecture.

Since the 1950s, many computers used microprogramming to implement their control logic which decoded the program instructions and executed them. The bits inside the microprogram words controlled the processor at the level of electrical signals.

The term: microarchitecture was used to describe the units that were controlled by the microprogram words, in contrast to the term: architecture that was visible and documented for programmers. While architecture usually had to be compatible between hardware generations, the underlying microarchitecture could be easily changed.

The microarchitecture is related to, but not the same as, the instruction set architecture. The instruction set architecture is near to the programming model of a processor as seen by an assembly language programmer or compiler writer, which includes the execution model, processor registers, address and data formats etc. The microarchitecture (or computer organization) is mainly a lower level structure and therefore manage a large number of details that are hidden in the programming model. It describes the inside parts of the processor and how they work together in order to implement the architectural specification.

Microarchitectual elements may be everything from single logic gates, to registers, lookup tables, multiplexers, counters, etc, to complete ALUs, FPUs and even larger elements. The electronic circuitry level can, in turn, be subdivided into transistor-level details, such as which basic gate-building structures are used and what logic implementation types (static/dynamic, number of phases, etc) are chosen, in addition to the actual logic design used built them.

A few important points:



A very simplified high level description — common in marketing — may show only fairly basic characteristics, such as bus-widths, along with various types of execution units and other large systems, such as branch prediction and cache memories, pictured as simple blocks — perhaps with some important attributes or characteristics noted. Some details regarding pipeline structure (like fetch, decode, assign, execute, write-back) may sometimes also be included.

The pipelined datapath is the most commonly used datapath design in microarchitecture today. This technique is used in most modern microprocessors, microcontrollers, and DSPs. The pipelined architecture allows multiple instructions to overlap in execution, much like an assembly line. The pipeline includes several different stages which are fundamental in microarchitecture designs. Some of these stages include instruction fetch, instruction decode, execute, and write back. Some architectures include other stages such as memory access. The design of pipelines is one of the central microarchitectural tasks. 

Execution units are also essential to microarchitecture. Execution units include arithmetic logic units (ALU), floating point units (FPU), load/store units, branch prediction, and SIMD. These units perform the operations or calculations of the processor. The choice of the number of execution units, their latency and throughput is a central microarchitectural design task. The size, latency, throughput and connectivity of memories within the system are also microarchitectural decisions. 

System-level design decisions such as whether or not to include peripherals, such as memory controllers, can be considered part of the microarchitectural design process. This includes decisions on the performance-level and connectivity of these peripherals. 

Unlike architectural design, where achieving a specific performance level is the main goal, microarchitectural design pays closer attention to other constraints. Since microarchitecture design decisions directly affect what goes into a system, attention must be paid to such issues as:


In general, all CPUs, single-chip microprocessors or multi-chip implementations run programs by performing the following steps:

Complicating this simple-looking series of steps is the fact that the memory hierarchy, which includes caching, main memory and non-volatile storage like hard disks, (where the program instructions and data reside) has always been slower than the processor itself. Step (2) often introduces a delay (in CPU terms often called a "stall") while the data arrives over the computer bus. A big amount of research has been put into designs that avoid these delays as much as possible. Over the years, a central design goal was to execute more instructions in parallel, thus increasing the effective execution speed of a program. These efforts introduced complicated logic and circuit structures.
In the past such techniques could only be implemented on expensive mainframes or supercomputers due to the amount of circuitry needed for these techniques. As semiconductor manufacturing progressed, more and more of these techniques could be implemented on a single semiconductor chip.

What follows is a survey of micro-architectural techniques that are common in modern CPUs. 

The choice of which Instruction Set Architecture to use greatly affects the complexity of implementing high performance devices. Over the years, computer designers did their best to simplify instruction sets, in order to enable higher performance implementations by saving designers effort and time for features which improve performance rather than wasting them on the complexity of instruction set. 

Instruction set design has progressed from CISC, RISC, VLIW, EPIC types. Architectures that are dealing with data parallelism include SIMD and Vectors.

One of the first, and most powerful, techniques to improve performance is the use of the instruction pipeline. Early processor designs performed all of the steps above on one instruction before moving onto the next. Large portions of the processor circuitry were left idle at any one step; for instance, the instruction decoding circuitry would be idle during execution and so on.

Pipelines improve performance by allowing a number of instructions to work their way through the processor at the same time. In the same basic example, the processor would start to decode (step 1) a new instruction while the last one was waiting for results. This would allow up to four instructions to be "in flight" at one time, making the processor look four times as fast. Although any one instruction takes just as long to complete (there are still four steps) the CPU as a whole "retires" instructions much faster and can be run at a much higher clock speed.

Improvements in chip manufacturing allowed more circuitry to be placed on the same chip, and designers started looking for ways to use it. One of the most common ways was to add an ever-increasing amount of cache memory on-chip. Cache is a very fast memory, memory that can be accessed in a few cycles as compared to what is needed to talk to main memory. The CPU includes a cache controller which automates reading and writing from the cache, if the data is already in the cache it simply "appears," whereas if it is not the processor is "stalled" while the cache controller reads it in.

RISC designs started adding cache in the mid-to-late 1980s, often only 4 KB in total. This number grew over time, and typical CPUs now have about 512 KB, while more powerful CPUs come with 1 or 2 or even 4, 6, 8 or 12 MB, organized in multiple levels of a memory hierarchy. Generally speaking, more cache means more speed.

Caches and pipelines were a perfect match for each other. Previously, it didn't make much sense to build a pipeline that could run faster than the access latency of off-chip cash memory. Using on-chip cache memory instead, meant that a pipeline could run at the speed of the cache access latency, a much smaller length of time. This allowed the operating frequencies of processors to increase at a much faster rate than that of off-chip memory.

Pipeline stalls and flushes due to branches are the two main things preventing achieving higher performance through instruction level parallelism. The from time that the processor's instruction decoder has found that it has encountered a conditional branch instruction to the time that the deciding jumping register value can be read out, the pipeline might be stalled for several cycles. On average, every fifth instruction executed is a branch, so that's a high amount of stalling. If the branch is taken, its even worse, as then all of the subsequent instructions which were in the pipeline needs to be flushed. 

Techniques such as branch prediction and speculative execution are used to reduce these branch penalties. Branch prediction is where the hardware makes educated guesses on whether a particular branch will be taken. The guess allows the hardware to prefetch instructions without waiting for the register read. Speculative execution is a further enhancement in which the code along the predicted path is executed before it is known whether the branch should be taken or not.

The addition of caches reduces the frequency or duration of stalls due to waiting for data to be fetched from the main memory hierarchy, but does not get rid of these stalls entirely. In early designs a "cache miss" would force the cache controller to stall the processor and wait. Of course there may be some other instruction in the program whose data "is" available in the cache at that point. Out-of-order execution allows that ready instruction to be processed while an older instruction waits on the cache, then re-orders the results to make it appear that everything happened in the programmed order.

Even with all of the added complexity and gates needed to support the concepts outlined above, improvements in semiconductor manufacturing soon allowed even more logic gates to be used. 

In the outline above the processor processes parts of a single instruction at a time. Computer programs could be executed faster if multiple instructions were processed simultaneously. This is what superscalar processors achieve, by replicating functional units such as ALUs. The replication of functional units was only made possible when the integrated circuit (some times called "die") area of a single-issue processor no longer stretched the limits of what could be reliably manufactured. By the late 1980s, superscalar designs started to enter the market place. 

In modern designs it is common to find two load units, one store (many instructions have no results to store), two or more integer math units, two or more floating point units, and often a SIMD unit of some sort. The instruction issue logic grows in complexity by reading in a huge list of instructions from memory and handing them off to the different execution units that are idle at that point. The results are then collected and re-ordered at the end.

Register renaming refers to a technique used to avoid unnecessary serialized execution of program instructions because of the reuse of the same registers by those instructions. Suppose we have to groups of instruction that will use the same register, one set of instruction is executed first to leave the register to the other set, but if the other set is assigned to a different similar register both sets of instructions can be executed in parallel.

Due to the growing gap between CPU operating frequencies and DRAM access times, none of the techniques that enhance instruction-level parallelism (ILP) within one program could overcome the long stalls (delays) that occurred when data had to be fetched from main memory. Additionally, the large transistor counts and high operating frequencies needed for the more advanced ILP techniques required power dissipation levels that could no longer be cheaply cooled. For these reasons, newer generations of computers have started to utilize higher levels of parallelism that exist outside of a single program or program thread.

This trend is sometimes known as "throughput computing". This idea originated in the mainframe market where online transaction processing emphasized not just the execution speed of one transaction, but the capacity to deal with big numbers of transactions at the same time. With transaction-based applications such as network routing and web-site serving greatly increasing in the last decade, the computer industry has re-emphasized capacity and throughput issues.

One technique of how this parallelism is achieved is through multiprocessing systems, computer systems with multiple CPUs. In the past this was reserved for high-end mainframes but now small scale (2-8) multiprocessors servers have become commonplace for the small business market. For large corporations, large scale (16-256) multiprocessors are common. Even personal computers with multiple CPUs have appeared since the 1990s.

Advances in semiconductor technology reduced transistor size; multicore CPUs have appeared where multiple CPUs are implemented on the same silicon chip. Initially used in-chips targeting embedded markets, where simpler and smaller CPUs would allow multiple instantiations to fit on one piece of silicon. By 2005, semiconductor technology allowed dual high-end desktop CPUs "CMP" chips to be manufactured in volume. Some designs, such as UltraSPARC T1 used a simpler (scalar, in-order) designs in order to fit more processors on one piece of silicon.

Recently, another technique that has become more popular is multithreading. In multithreading, when the processor has to fetch data from slow system memory, instead of stalling for the data to arrive, the processor switches to another program or program thread which is ready to execute. Though this does not speed up a particular program/thread, it increases the overall system throughput by reducing the time the CPU is idle.

Conceptually, multithreading is equivalent to a context switch at the operating system level. The difference is that a multithreaded CPU can do a thread switch in one CPU cycle instead of the hundreds or thousands of CPU cycles a context switch normally requires. This is achieved by replicating the state hardware (such as the register file and program counter) for each active thread.

A further enhancement is simultaneous multithreading. This technique allows superscalar CPUs to execute instructions from different programs/threads simultaneously in the same cycle.

Southampton Corporation Tramways

Southampton Corporation Tramways was a transport company that opened in 1879 and closed in 1949. At first the trams were horse-drawn, but later they were powered by electricity.

Southampton, a city of the United Kingdom located in Hampshire, was becoming bigger in the nineteenth century. The population was 27,000 people in 1841. This was because the docks were becoming much more used. Also, a railway openened in 1839 and a horse-drawn omnibus service started at as well. By 1843 a regular service was running from the station to Millbrook, Eling, Bitterne, Shirley, Portswood, Totton and Romsey. Because of this, by 1861 the population had become 42,000.

By 1872 tramways were a lot more popular. The British and Foreign Tramway Company contacted Southampton Corporation with an idea to set up a tramway in the town. Lots of people were against the idea. The Corporation did not allow tram tracks to be put in the High Street and Above Bar. The British and Foreign Tramway Company stopped thinking about the idea.

In 1876 Southampton Corporation saw that their public transport was not as good as the public transport in other cities. The Southampton Tramways Company was made to build a new tramway system. The tramway started to be built in the summer of 1878.

The first tram ran on 5 May 1879. The tramway made £26. Many people did not want the trams to run on a Sunday, and 3,500 people put their names on a petition to stop the trams running on a Sunday. The company's manager said that there were lots of people who rode on the trams on Sunday and that the service would continue. If the service made money on a Sunday, then the trams would keep running. The first tram route that opened was Stag Gate - Holy Rood. A second route opened on 6 May 1879 which was Alma Road - Canute Road - Oxford Street - High Street - Floating Dock and Stag Gates - Lodge Road - Portswood. The Tramway Junction - Commercial Road - Shirley route opened on 9 June 1879.

The company got into some trouble soon after it opened. One of the managers ran away with some money to America in 1881. Another manager got the sack in 1882 because there was a problem with the company's money. By 1887 though the company had recovered. It had a good financial base to stand on, and it was paying divedends of 8% a year to its shareholders. On the 22 October 1889, the Portswood route ran via Spear Road and Avenue Road. Fares cost less money in 1896 because they changed from 3 to 2 for "through routes". The tram times became two times as fast to every 5 minutes from Stag Gates to Holy Rood. Four new trams and forty horses were needed to run this service.

The Southampton Tramway Company was bought by Southampton Corporation on 30 June 1898 for £51,000.

The tramway had twenty-three tramcars when it was bought in 1898. They were:

Southampton Corporation bought the Southampton Electric Light and Power Company in 1896. Two years later in 1898 it bought the Southampton Tramway Company two years later in 1898. This allowed them to change the town's tramway system to electricity instead of horse power. In 1899 a group of people from the Corporation visited tram systems in Bradford, Dover, Glasgow, Liverpool and London for ideas. They decided that Southampton's was going to be based on Liverpool's. The first electric tram route from Junction to Shirley opened on 22 January 1900. The second route from Stag Gates to Holy Road via Prospect Place opened on 29 May 1900. Over the next 3 years the system slowly got bigger. The following routes opened:
The last route to open as part of the first stage of the electrified system was Portswood - Hampton Park on 25 July 1903.

Before World War One more routes were added:

After the war, more new routes were added:

After thiese additions, the system was at its biggest. The only new lines opened after this were to miss out the Bargate Arch in Southampton. The east side opened on 24 April 1932 and the west side on 5 June 1938. 

Before World War 2, two routes were also closed. Roberts Road - Millbrook closed on 2 October 1935 except for workmen's services. It did however re-open whilst the war was happening. The second route to close was Clock Tower - Northam Bridge, which closed on 4 June 1926.

When the electrified system opened it needed some new tramcars to replace the horse drawn ones. The first trams used on the system were built by G F Milnes & Co., Birkenhead. They had open upper deck had back-to-back "knifeboard" seats so that they could fit under Bargate arch. No.2 was changed into a ""toastrack"" car in 1916. It was sold to Portsmouth in 1919 where it became Number 104. In 1903 twelve trams were built by Hurst, Nelson & Co. The trams originally had three windows on each side on the bottom deck. This was later chnged to have four windows on each side because the original design did not give enough support for the top deck. Two bogie trams were ordered in 1910. This order was later cancelled. The system also bought six ex-London County Council Tramways cars with enclosed upper decks. These were numbered 75-80. A final sixteen trams were bought in 1918. As well as these, a number of trams were built by the tramway:

Before 1932, the only road route between Southampton High Street and Above Bar was through the arch in the centre of the Bargate. In 1923 a new design of enclosed double deck tram was built by P.J Baker, General Manager of the tramways. It had a rounded top that would fit through the arch. These trams had smaller wheels to help reduce the tram's height. They were driven by high speed motors which produced more torque. However, the roadway through the arch in the Bargate still had to be lowered to allow the trams to pass through the arch. Some secret changing of the profile of the arch's masonry was also needed at the last minute. Trams started to pass around the East of the Bargate on 24 April 1932. The last tram to pass through the central archway did so on 4 June 1938. By this time part of Southampton ancient walls had been demolished so that the Bargate was passable on both sides.

Southampton Tramways were mainly affected by staffing issues during World War I. To try and stop this women were allowed to become "conductorettes". Because of this toastrack tram No.2 had a gangway cut through the middle of it. In the early years of the war a tram went round Southampton for two hours twice a week. It had a military band playing on the top deck. This was an effort to try and boost recruitment.

World War II affected Southampton much more than World War One. Women were again employed by the company. Unlike in World War I though they were allowed to drive the trams this time.

Car No.31 was destroyed by an incendiary bomb on 30 November 1940. It was the only tram to be destroyed during the war. To save the fleet of trams from the intensive bombing of Southampton during World War II they were painted grey. Regular services stopped at 7pm and they were parked up overnight in Cemetery Road on Southampton Common for the same reason.

In November 1942, a tram was accidentally set in motion whilst parked up overnight. It took two other trams with it. The unmanned convoy of trams was stopped by a lorry before anybody was hurt. The incident caused some worry locally because it was thought that saboteurs were responsible. It later emerged that the incident was due to a young boy playing on the trams.

The trams in Southampton made good profits for Southampton Corporation. However the Corporation had not put those profits back into the tram system. Because of this the whole system needed modernisation by the end of the Second World War. This included the trams, the power supply and the track.

It was decided that buses were a better alternative to modernising the trams. The tramway system therefore closed. The first line to close was Bitterne Park - St. Mary's - Docks on 15 May 1948. Swaythling - Portswood - Lodge Road - Stag Gates closed on 30 October 1948. Swaythling - Burgess Road - Bassett Crossroads - Avenue Junction closed on 5 March 1949. Floating Bridge - Shirley, Holy Rood - High Street - Royal Pier and Roberts Road - Millbrook all closed on 31 December 1949. The last movement of a tram in Southampton was on 4 February 1950 when cars No.21 and No.101 were moved from Shirley depot to Portswood depot under their own power. After the system closed some trams were sold to Leeds. The majority though were sent to A F Harris's scrapyard at Bevois Valley for scrapping. A few were sold on from there to be used as sheds or summer houses. This allowed some trams to be preserved.

Three Southampton trams have survived.

European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo

The European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo also called EULEX Kosovo is a contract between the European Union and Kosovo. With this, certain states of the European Union will send police forces as well as lawyers to help make Kosovo more secure. This is what was agreed by the Ahtisaari plan. The idea is to continue the presence of foreign police forces to help the police in Kosovo, as planned under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. Russia and Serbia see this mission as illegal. The plan is to have 2.000 police force and lawyers on the ground. The mission started to deploy its forces on 16 February 2008. Currently only 400 of the some 1,900 police officers and judges foreseen by the EULEX mission are in place.

The European Council agreed on sending 1800 to 1900 people on 14 December 2007. Because of the unstable political climate, this force was later increased to 2000 people. This was mainly done because it was impossible to reach an agreement with Serbia. The force is made up mainly of police officers. Some of the officers have received training how to control rioting crowds. Some people of the force are prosecutors and judges. Because the force is so big, there will soon be the most EU civil servants doing their job there, rather than in Brussels. Chief of the mission is Yves de Kermabon, who is accountable to the European Union Special Representative in Kosovo, Pieter Feith. The mission is expected to cost €165 million in its first year.

The final decision on the mission was planned to be taken on 28 January 2008. This was postponed due to concerns over possible negative effects on the second round of the presidential election in Serbia on 3 February 2008 and the possible signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia on that date. The officially voiced reason for the postponement is the lack of a legal basis (through a UNSC resolution or something similar) for the mission. A Joint Action was approved on 4 February 2008, meaning that only the final approval is required; it is expected to be given on 18 February 2008.

There are still questions on how this mission should replace the UN administration in Kosovo. Until these are answered, Spain will not take part in the mission. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos told a meeting of European Union Foreign Ministers that Spain will not send its contingent to the EULEX mission until there has been a formal transfer of powers from the United Nations.

Apart from EU members, third parties Croatia, Turkey, Switzerland, Norway and the United States will also take part.

The countries of the European Union are currently divided. Some recognise Kosovo, others do not. The current Presidency of the European Council said
that countries could send people to take part in the mission, even without recognising Kosovo as an independent state.

According to the EU, the mission will be based on United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. This resolution introduced international rule in Kosovo, in 1999. The EU force has so far not received a new UN Security Council directive, because Russia opposed it. Russia blocked the transfer of the UN mission to the EU. According to Serbia, the mission implies that the EU recognises Kosovo as an independent state..

Beige is a very pale yellowish-cream color. 

The name comes from "beige cloth", a woolen fabric left in its natural color. It then came to be used for a range of light tints of yellow chosen for their neutral or pale warm colored appearance. 

In the 1920s, the meaning of the term "beige" expanded to the point where it is now also used for not only for pale yellows but also for a wide range of pale brown shades.

The first recorded use of "beige" as a color name in English was in 1887.

Digital signal processor

A digital signal processor (DSP or DSP micro) is a specialized microprocessor designed specifically for digital signal processing, generally used in real-time computing.

Digital signal processing algorithms require a large number of mathematical operations to be performed quickly on a set of data. Signals are converted from analog to digital, manipulated digitally, and then converted again to form digital to analog, as shown in the diagram. Many digital signal processing applications have real-time constraints; that is, for the system to work, the DSP operation must be completed within some time constraint.

The microarchitecture of a digital signal processor is optimized specifically for digital signal processing applications.

Lies for the Liars is a full-length album released in 2007 by The Used. It is currently their most recent album.


"Smother Me" ends at 4:20 but runs to 6:17 due to the addition of a hidden track titled "Queso". "Queso" is a 30 second song that is about a quesadilla. Though it was first released on The Used's MySpace in late 2006, most fans talked about it on message boards and thought of it as a joke - it was not expected to actually be on the album.

"Lies for the Liars" contains emotive, heartfelt and sometimes sarcastic or Gothic lyrics. It has more swearing than previous The Used albums, but this is used on fewer songs. For example, "Liar Liar (Burn in Hell)" swears 10 times.

The first song "The Ripper" has an ending that makes the CD appear to be stuck, but its only part of the song.

Digital signal processing

Digital signal processing (DSP) is concerned with the processing of digital signals or analog signals after converting from analog to digital format.
DSP includes subfields like: communication signals processing, radar signal processing, sensor array processing, digital image processing, etc. 

DSP is usually used with real-world analog signals found in our lives, the first step is usually to convert the signal from an analog to a digital form, by using an analog-to-digital converter. Often, the required output signal is another real-world analog signal, which requires a digital-to-analog converter.

This stadium should not be confused with Blumenau's stadium, which is also called Estádio Aderbal Ramos da Silva, however it is nicknamed DEBA, and has a maximum capacity of 4,000 people.

In 1982, to replace the old Estádio Adolfo Konder, Avaí bought a groundplot close to the city's airport (Hercílio Luz International Airport). The construction works were led by Cairo Bueno, and the stadium was designed by the architect Davi Ferreira Lima.

The inaugural match was played on November 15, 1983, when Vasco da Gama beat Avaí 6-1. The first goal of the stadium was scored by Vasco da Gama's Wilson Tadei.

On May 31, 1986, the stadium lights were inaugurated.

The stadium's attendance record currently stands at 19,000, set on July 17, 1988 when Avaí beat Blumenau 2-0, for the Campeonato Catarinense final.

Opel Sintra

The Opel Sintra is an Large MPV produced by the german automaker Opel
from 1996 to 2000. The Sintra is branded as Opel in Europe (except for GB), South Africa, China, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, Vauxhall in Great Britain, Holden in Australia and in New Zealand, and Chevrolet in Latin America, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, depending on the market.

The reason for the Sintra to end production was because EuroNCAP tested a 1998 model and found it only scored 2.5 Stars, forcing Opel to drop the model in 1999. Because the Astra-Based Zafira MPV debuted when the Sintra finished production in 1999, sometimes it is said that the Zafira replaced the Sintra,but actually Opel never had another Large MPV after the Sintra, and then eventually Opel abandoned the Large MPV style in Europe.

Poison dart frog

Poison dart frog is the common name of a group of frogs in the family Dendrobatidae. They are native to Central and South America. 

Unlike most frogs, these are active during the day. They often have brightly-coloured bodies, which act as warning colouration. Although all dendrobatids are at least somewhat toxic in the wild, levels of toxicity vary greatly from one species to the next, and from one population to another. Many species are critically endangered. Blue poison dart frogs are poisonous because they eat ants and other small insects that have toxins in their bodies. If an animal eats the frog, it will become very sick.
