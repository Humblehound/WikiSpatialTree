Character actor

A character actor is an actor who plays a particular kind of character in a play or in a film, opera or ballet. The character actor is not the main part. He is not the lover or hero. He has a character which helps to support the main characters and therefore the story.

Character roles may be roles such as: the faithful servant, the maid, the villain, the mother-in-law, the priest etc. They may or may not be comic characters.

For example: in "The Wizard of Oz" the main character is Dorothy. The Scarecrow, the Lion and the Tin Man are character roles.

Some actors or singers prefer character roles to main roles. It may be because this kind or role suits their personality or their singing voice. Some people nearly always play the same kind of character role. We say that people like that are "typecast". Some actors are happy to remain typecast. Others may wish to broaden their repertoire and take on different roles.

Giulio Caccini

Giulio Caccini (born Rome, 8 October 1551; died Florence, 10 December 1618), also known as Giulio Romano, was an Italian composer and singer. He lived at the very end of Renaissance period and the beginning of the Baroque period. It was the time when opera was starting, and he was one of the first composers to write an opera. His son, Francesca Caccini, also became a composer.

We do not know much about his life. He was born in Rome. His father was a carpenter. He learned to play the lute, the viol and the harp, and soon became known as a singer. In the 1560s, Francesco de' Medici, Grand Duke of Florence, was impressed with his talent, so he took him to Florence to study.

By 1579, Caccini was singing at the Medici court. He was a tenor, and he was able to accompany himself on the viol or the archlute; he sang at weddings and other important occasions. He worked closely with the Florentine Camerata, a famous group of people who met at the home of Count Giovanni de' Bardi, and tried to bring the tradition of Greek dramatic music back to life. They liked monody, which means a tune with a simple accompaniment. This was different from polyphony in which several things are being sung at once. Monody made it easy to tell a story because the words could be heard clearly. This was necessary for opera, where it became heard in a simple form called recitative.

Caccini went to Rome, but in Rome the musicians were not so interested in change.

Caccini often got involved in arguments because he was envious and jealous. He often got people into trouble, and he rushed his own opera "Euridice" into print before Peri's opera on the same subject could be published, while telling his own singers not to have anything to do with Peri's opera.

He died in Florence and is buried in the church of St. Annunziata.

Free Soil Party

The Free Soil Party was, for a short time, a political party in the United States. It was active in the 1848 and 1852 president elections, and in some state elections. It got lots of its strength from New York. Most of the important party members were former anti-slavery members of the Whig Party and the Democratic Party. Its main purpose was stopping slavery from spreading into the western lands, arguing that free men on free soil had a morally and economically better system than slavery.

The party membership was largely taken over by the Republican Party in 1854.

<doc id="236478" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=236478" title="The Jungle">
The Jungle

The Jungle is a 1906 novel written by journalist Upton Sinclair. Sinclair wrote this book to show the sufferings of the working class and to show the corruption of the American meatpacking industry during the early-20th century. The book writes about the poverty, bad living and working conditions, and sorrow among the working class. The sad state of turn-of-the-century work is placed for the American public to see, suggesting that something needed to be changed to get rid of American "wage slavery". The novel is also an important example of the "muckraking" tradition begun by journalists such as Jacob Riis.
Upton Sinclair came to Chicago with hopes of writing "The Jungle". When he came to the lobby of the Chicago Transit House, a hotel, he was quoted as saying, "Hello! I'm Upton Sinclair, and I'm here to write the "Uncle Tom's Cabin" of the Labor Movement!". He rented living quarters and immediately began walking its streets, talking to its people and taking pictures. One Sunday afternoon, he worked his way into a group of Lithuanian immigrants getting together for a wedding party, "Behold, there was the opening scene of my story, a gift from the gods". He was welcomed there and was with them until two in the morning.

"The Jungle" was first published in a series in 1905. "After five rejections", its first edition as a book was published by Doubleday, Page & Company on February 28, 1906, and it became an immediate best seller and has been in print ever since.

Emperor Keikō

No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty. 

Keikō is almost certainly a legend; but the "Kojiki" and "Nihonshoki" record his name.

The limited information about Keikō does not imply that no such person ever existed. Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei. 

In "Kojiki", Keikō sent his one of his sons to Kyūshū to fight battles on his behalf. In "Nihonshoki", Keikō fought and won these battles against local tribes. According to both sources, he sent Yamatotakeru to Izumo province and eastern provinces to expand his territory.

This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Keikō.

The actual site of his grave is not known. According to the Imperial Household Agency, this emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Nara. The "kami" of Emperor Keikō is also venerated at Anaho jinja in Anaho, Ōmi province.

Prince James, Prince of Wales (James Francis Edward Stuart; "The Old Pretender" or "The Old Chevalier"; 10 June 1688 – 1 January 1766) was the son of James II of England (James VII of Scotland). Because of this, he claimed the English, Scottish and Irish thrones (as James III of England and Ireland and James VIII of Scotland) from the death of his father in 1701, when he was proclaimed king of England, Scotland and Ireland by his cousin Louis XIV of France.

<doc id="236493" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=236493" title="Prince of Orange">
Prince of Orange

Prince of Orange is a title of nobility.

The title is used by members of the House of Orange-Nassau, as heirs to the crown of the Netherlands. It also used by members of the House of Hohenzollern. At the moment, the title is used by Prince Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands (Orange-Nassau), Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia (Hohenzollern) and Guy, Marquis de Mailly-Neslé, Prince d'Orange.

The title was at first related to a self-ruling state called the Principality of Orange. It lies in the south of what we now call France. The land was the property of the house of Orange and from 1544 of the house of Orange-Nassau. 

The last of the original princes, René of Nassau, left the principality to his cousin William the Silent after he died. William the Silent was not related to the original house of Orange, but was the legal heir.

In a war in 1673, Louis XIV of France took over the lands of the principality and added them to his own royal domain. This was part of the war against the stadtholder William III of Orange. Louis XIV then gave the principality to Louis of Mailly-Nesles, marquis of Nesles (1689–1764), a very remote relation of the original princes of Orange. His descendant still claims the title today. In 1714, Louis XIV allowed Prince Louis Armand of Bourbon-Conti to use the land of the Principality to make money. Prince Louis Armand died in 1727 and the principality was merged in the Crown in 1731.

William III died without legitimate children. This meant that the principality was seen as inherited by his closest cognate relative on the basis of the testament of Frederic-Henry, Frederick I of Prussia . He handed over the principality's lands but not the title to France in 1713. France supported his claim. In this way, the territory of the principality was no longer a separate state, but became a part of France. Through the Treaty of Utrecht. A new "Principality of Orange" was created by the King of Prussia as part of the duchy of Gelderland.. The kings of Prussia and the German emperors styled themselves Princes of Orange till 1918.

John William Friso of Nassau was chosen as the heir to the princes of Orange in the Netherlands by the last will of William III. John William Friso was also related to William the Silent through the female line. Several of his descendants became stadtholders. They claim the principality of Orange on the basis of agnatic inheritance (inheritance of lands to the brother rather than the sons of the king) . This way of inheriting is similar to the way William the Silent inherited from his cousin René. The claim to the title is also on basis of the testament of Philips William, Maurice and William III. Although they claimed the title "Prince of Orange", France never allowed them to obtain anything of the lands of the principality itself. It is from this tradition that later stadtholders of the Netherlands, and the present-day royal family of the Netherlands, also hold the title.

Until 1340, it was customary for all sons of the prince of Orange to inherit the title. 
Only the direct line of descent to Raimond V is shown here.

Invitation to William

The Invitation to William was a letter sent by seven famous Englishmen. They were later named the Immortal Seven. They sent this letter to William III, Prince of Orange, received by him on 30 June 1688 (Julian calendar, 10 July Gregorian calendar). In England a Catholic male heir to the throne, James Francis Edward Stuart, had been born. The letter asked William to force the ruling king, his father-in-law James II of England to make William's Protestant wife Mary, James's oldest daughter, the heir. This might possibly be done by saying that the newborn Prince of Wales was not really James' son. 

The letter told William that if he were to land in England with a small army, they would rise up and support him. The Invitation shortly told him about their complaints against King James. They said that the King's son was not really the King's son and that the English people generally believed him to be false. They complained that William had sent a letter to James him with the birth of his son. It was carried to William in The Hague by Rear Admiral Arthur Herbert (the later Lord Torrington) disguised as a common sailor. It was read by a secret code. 

The invitation made William decide to carry out his existing plans to land with a large Dutch army. This ended in the Glorious Revolution during which James was taken off king and replaced by William and Mary as joint rulers.

A royal house or royal dynasty is a family title, or family name of sorts. It is used by royalty. It usually means the members of a family in old and young people, who are loosely related. Unlike most western people, a great number of the world's royal families do not have family names, and those that have them do not use them often. They are referred to instead by their titles, often related to an area ruled or once ruled by that family. Royal Houses still exist today.
The majority of these nations are now republics or part of republics. The Princely Houses of Germany often have given their own names to the states they ruled.

Understudy

In theater, an understudy is an actor or singer who learns the part of one of the main actors or singers in case they are ill.

If there is an emergency and a main performer is unable to perform, the understudy will take their place. Very often the understudy is a member of the chorus who might have had a small part in the performance anyway. Sometimes an understudy is called a "standby". A standby is usually not a member of the chorus or ensemble. They may be required to be present in the theatre during the performance, or part of it, in case of an emergency.

Sometimes an understudy will become famous when they unexpectedly have to perform instead of the usual lead person.

She was born on 12 March 1638 (Old Style) or 22 March 1638 (New Style), at Windsor, Berkshire of the Hyde family.

The royal family for some time remained in exile after the English Civil War. Anne's father served as the Royalist chief adviser to the future King Charles II of England, James's older brother. Anne was Maid of Honour to Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, sister of Charles and James. It was during this time that James seduced Anne while she was in his sister's service and Charles forced James to marry Anne. He said that her strong character would be a good influence on his weak-willed brother.

The couple went through an official marriage ceremony on 3 September 1660, in London, following the English Restoration of the monarchy. Anne was not a beautiful woman. In fact, Samuel Pepys slights her as being quite plain. However, the French Ambassador described her as having "courage, cleverness, and energy almost worthy of a King's blood".

Wilhelm Steinitz

Wilhelm (later "William") Steinitz (Prague, 17 May 1836 – New York, 12 August 1900) was an Austrian chess grandmaster who emigrated first to London, then to the USA. 

He was the first undisputed World Chess Champion, and held it from 1886 to 1894. 

Steinitz won the title by beating Johannes Zukertort in a match in 1886. He lost it to Emanuel Lasker in 1894. He also lost a rematch with Lasker in 1897.<ref name="H/W">Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. "The Oxford companion to chess". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.</ref>

Born a Jew in Bohemia, Steinitz studied mathematics at the Vienna Polytecnic, and won the Vienna chess championship in 1861 with a score of 31/32. After playing in the London 1862 tournament, he stayed in London as a professional player in clubs and coffee houses. He won a series of matches against all the best English and other players living in London. This established him as one of the best player in the world.

Steinitz beat Adolf Anderssen in 1866, and some think he should be regarded as world champion from this date. 

Apart from the chess, this match was a landmark in chess organisation. It was the first event to be timed by clocks. The time for each move was recorded by hand. The totals for each player could then be added. This was the first practical step taken to make sure each player had the same total thinking time available. It had always been a problem that some players took much longer than others, unfairly so. Timimg also helped to keep the total time for play within bounds. Eventually, special chess clocks were designed, and the idea has spread to other two-person games such as Go.

Steinitz beat Johannes Zukertort in 1872, and again later in 1886. This last match all agree was for the world championship. Zukertort was a brilliant and boastful player, who was also resident in London for many years. Both the men wrote for chess magazines, and there was a good deal of rivalry. 

Steinitz did not win a really strong tournament until London 1872, and did not finish above Andersson until Vienna 1873. He came equal first at Vienna 1882, and second (to Zukertort) in London 1883, both top-class events. In general, his tournament play was not so outstanding as his match play. In match play he was the best of his day: he won 24 matches running until Lasker beat him.

As a younger man, Steinitz played in the all-out attacking style that was common in the 1860s. Later, he developed a new positional style of play and demonstrated that it was superior to the previous style. His new style was controversial, and some even branded it as 'cowardly'. Some of Steinitz's games showed that it could also set up attacks as ferocious as those of the old school. 

Steinitz was argumentative, and was often in disputes with other chess writers. He was a prolific writer in chess magazines, and defended his ideas vigorously. The debate was bitter and sometimes abusive: it became known as the 'Ink War'. By the early 1890s, Steinitz' approach was more widely accepted and the next generation of top players acknowledged their debt to him, especially his successor as world champion, Emanuel Lasker.

Lasker summed up the new style as: 

Steinitz left England for the United States in 1886, and became an American citizen in 1888. 

He was given an enthusiastic reception, played several exhibitions, many casual games, a match for stakes of £50 with a wealthy amateur, and slightly more serious matches with New World professionals. The match with the Cuban champion Celso Golmayo Zúpide was abandoned when Steinitz was leading (eight wins, one draw, one loss). His hosts even arranged a visit to New Orleans, where Paul Morphy lived.

While based in New York he played matches against Zukertort (St Louis 1883), twice against Russia's Mikhail Chigorin (Havana 1889 & 1892), Isidor Gunsberg (New York 1890/91). Finally, there were the two losing matches against Emanuel Lasker, (Philadelphia/New York/Montreal 1894 and Moscow 1896/97). These were all for the world championship. There were also a dozen matches against lesser masters, including four against J.H. Blackburne, the leading English professional.

The book of the Hastings 1895 chess tournament, written collectively by the players, described Steinitz as follows:

Steinitz died in poverty, having spent some of his last years in a New York mental institution. His second wife and their two young children survived him, and a fund of $1050 was raised to help them.

List of chess terms: in alphabetical order.

When the game is paused temporarily. Less common today, as most games are played to a finish. If a game is adjourned, a sealed move is necessary so the player to move does not have any advantage.

Method to decide the result of an unfinished game. It is done by an expert who judges the position on the board. The expert is often appointed before the tournament or match starts. The method is only used if games are not played to a finish, and there are no adjournments.

See J'Adoube

System of chess notation in which each square has one name. From White's left, each file is labelled from a to h. From White's bottom rank, each rank is labelled 1 to 8. Thus the bottom left square is a1, and the top right square is h8.

Commentary on a game using a combination of written comments, and chess notation.

Pawn on an otherwise open file, on the 2nd or 3rd rank, which cannot be supported by another pawn, or advanced.

Bishop blocked long-term by pawns on squares of its own colour.

Endgames with few pawns or pieces. Set positions and ideas which can be taught to learners, and which every player should know. 

A bind is a hold on the opponent's position which stops him freeing it. Usually by means of pawns; a severe type of restraint.

Chess played by a strong player without being able to see the board. The player is not blind, but sits with his back to the boards, or wears a blindfold. Moves are called out in notation.

Defined by FIDE (Appendix C) as a game where all the moves must be made within a set time of less than 15 minutes for each side. They are always played with clocks. Some special rules are required. Players need not write down the moves; touch & move does not apply. Instead, a move is completed only when the player starts the opponent's clock. There is usually a provision for a player to stop the clock and claim a draw when there is no way for the opponent to win. Wins on time must be claimed by the player; games are drawn if both flags fall.

The obstruction of an enemy pawn by placing a piece in front of it so that it cannot move. 

Also, more generally, the severe restraint of an opponent's position so that it is difficult for him to find active play.

A type of chess played by four players on two boards. Pieces can be moved from one board to another. A checkmate on either board wins the game.

A simultaneous move (the only one in chess) whereby king and rook move past each other. See page for details.

The earliest form of chess. See History of chess.

Any deliberate violation of the Laws of Chess. The most frequent accusations of cheating include violations of the touch and move law (Article 4) and 'no outside help' (Article 12) rules.

A move which attacks the opposing king.

A move which attacks the opposing king, and which the opponent cannot get out of.

Clocks control the timing of chess games. They show separately the time taken by each player. Electronic clocks can also count the moves made, and apply the set time limits for a game.

A forcing sequence of moves, usually a sacrifice, to gain the advantage. In the diagram White wins with 1.Nh6+ Kh8 2.Qg8+ Rxg8 3.Nf7#. This is both a combination and a smothered mate.

Chess with moves sent by mail. Once popular, especially in remote areas, but now not so popular. It has been hurt by the invention of computer chess engines.

A bishop which moves on the dark squares.


A fundamental concept of opening theory. The number of pieces in active play. Can be assessed comparatively, by counting the number of active pieces developed by each side. To some extent, development is reactive. What one player does is affected by what the opponent does. Therefore, development proceeds differently in different openings.

The squares on which bishops move, at 45 to the ranks and files.

A check given by a line-piece when a shielding piece or pawn is moved out of the way.

The basis of all tactics. It occurs when one move attacks two places at the same time, as might happen with a discovered check, or a fork.

Two pawns of the same colour on the same file. Can only happen after a capture by one of the pawns.

The rating system invented by the late Professor Arpad Elo, and used by FIDE since 1970. The system gives a four-figure number which shows how well a player has scored in those games which have been entered into the database. It is an estimate of strength based on results, and is widely used to place players into categories. 2500 and above is grandmaster level.

The stage of the game with few pieces or when queens are exchanged and the middle game is over.

A special method of capturing, only available to a pawn on its fifth rank. See "En passant" rule.

May mean:

Developing the bishop at the squares b2, g2, b7 or g7. Also, moving a pawn one square forward to allow this. It is a hallmark of the hypermodern openings: the bishops there do not occupy the centre, but influence it.

"Fédération Internationale des Échecs": the International Chess Federation. The overall governing body of the game.

The game is drawn if 50 moves are played "with no captures and no pawn moves". This is to prevent a player forcing his opponent to play on in a position where no win is possible, yet where three-fold repetition has not happened. The rule is ancient: the Arabic version of the game, Shatranj, had a 70-move rule.

There is an exception to the 50-move rule. There are some positions which require more than 50 moves to win, yet have no captures or pawn moves. They are rare, and many players never see such an event in their lifetime. The circumstance is as follows. Suppose a computer study has shown that a particular position can be won in 58 moves (without pawn moves or captures), but not fewer. This is proved because a computer can try out every alternative. Then the case is published (so FIDE can list it for arbitrators). The cases listed by FIDE in 1988 were:

What FIDE did for these cases was to extend the 50-move rule to 75 moves. However, still more cases were found, many with far more moves needed. At that, FIDE decided to cancel the extension. Now the 50-move rule applies to all games without exception.

Little images of pieces used in diagrams and printed chess scores (moves). Software is available which permits chess authors to compose text with diagrams and figurines. Together with standard symbols, this makes texts available for international sale. For this to apply, the text should have little or no prose, or use a widely understood language like English.

The eight vertical columns on the board, numbered a to h. The phrase "open file" is used when no pawn blocks a file.

A double attack when one piece, such as a knight, attacks two or three pieces at once.

A method for recording positions. The board is read from a8 to h8, and rank by rank from the black side to the white side. Then the result is written down by hand, putting numbers for blank squares. rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR is the starting position.

A chess opening in which a player offers a pawn (or more) for fast development and an attack. Examples:

Grading or rating: a number which indicates how likely one player is to beat another. A competitive ranking list based solely on results.

A group of players in the early 1920s who had new ideas on openings; and any of the openings they promoted.

An IQP is an isolated queen's pawn, one of the most common types of isolated pawn. Openings with an IQP lead to distinctive middlegame strategies.

Isolated pawns do not have a pawn of the same colour on either of the adjacent files.

Means 'I adjust'; said before adjusting a piece on the board during a game. Usually occurs when a player has made a move, and carelessly left the piece overlapping the square.

Kriegspiel ('War game') is an unorthodox chess game in which the players only know for certain the moves of their own pieces. They have to deduce where the opponent's pieces are by questioning an umpire. It is played on three boards with partitions between them. The umpire sits with the middle board with the true position. Players are permitted to ask two kinds of question. "Can I move here?" and "Are there any?" (meaning pawn captures). The umpire replies accordingly. Checks and captures are announced by the umpire, and provide more clues. The game was invented by Henry Michael Temple (1862–1928).

Chess played with human beings as pieces on a giant board. A spectacle which has been performed since the 15th century. Usually, masters or other celebrities decide the moves, and a steward with a stick instructs the 'pieces' where to move.

Queen or rook.

Not a game, but a series of games. Used of team events or a series of games between two players.

The part of the game which follows the opening. Plans are formed, based on the position, and put into action.

Bishop or knight.

The method of writing down chess moves. See also Forsyth notation.

The start of the game, about a dozen moves. Openings have names, and extensive theory has been worked out by masters. Traditionally, the opening ends when minor pieces (knights and bishops) have been developed, and players have castled. However, modern openings go much further, into the early middlegame. See development.

When a piece does not move because to do so would expose a more valuable piece to capture. Pins against the king are absolute because it is illegal to move the pinned piece.

Play dominated by long-term manoeuvring, not short-term attacks and threats. It needs judgement more than calculation. The term is contrasted with tactics.

A chess problem is an artificial construction, not part of the game, but using a board and pieces. It is a separate intellectual activity. Chess problems have a history as long as the game itself, and their own terminology. The Arabs (9th/10th centuries) used specially composed positions ("mansurbat") as teaching devices; the idea of specifying a set number of moves to mate is European. Problem solving tournaments are held, and there is a World Championship for problem solvers. There are also international prizes for problem composers.

Promotion is what happens when a pawn reaches the 8th rank. Then it must be changed for a piece: a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same colour (player's choice). Normally, the pawn is "queened", but in some cases another piece is chosen, called 'under-promotion'.

A key concept of positional chess. It is a move, or sequence of moves, to deal with an opponent's plan before it starts. Sometimes one can completely stop the threat; sometimes one just makes the plan relatively harmless. The idea was spelled out in detail in Nimzovich's books "My system" and "Chess praxis". Prophylactic moves are often seen in games by Capablanca, Petrosian and Karpov. 

A prophylactic move might prevent a pawn move which would free the opponent's pieces or might simply protect one's own weak points.

The idea of choosing the layout of the pieces on the back row at random. The point is to avoid opening knowledge. White picks the pieces out of a bag and places them left to right; Black places his pieces on the corresponding squares. Alternatively, each player places his own pieces at random, producing two different arrays. The idea has been tried several times in the last 200 years, but has never caught on. There are problems. Usually special rules are needed for the king (castling?) and the bishops (no two bishops on the same colour squares). More serious is the great difficulty players experience in getting the pieces to work together. 

The horizontal eight lines on the board, labelled 1 to 8.

Rapidplay (FIDE Laws, Appendix B) is a game where each player has a set time for all the moves. That time can be from 15 to 60 minutes. Players need not record the moves. The touch & move rule is usually put aside by the organiser; if so starting the opponent's clock is the official end of a move. In other words, a player can change his mind so long as his own clock is running.

To concede loss of the game. A resignation is usually done by stopping the clock, and sometimes by offering a handshake or saying "I resign".

The intentional loss of material to get a more important result. Often the start of a combination.

The sheet of paper used to write down the moves of a game in progress. During formal games both players must record the game using a score sheet.

Made when a game is adjourned. Score sheet with move and position are placed in an envelope, and played on the board when the game is resumed.

When a master plays a number of opponents at the same time. Usually arranged as a ring of tables, with the master moving round inside, and the opponents outside. Players move when the master arrives at their board, master replies and moves on.

Like a pin, but the valuable piece is in front. So black B, white K and white R on a diagonal in that order wins the rook.
Unlike the fork, a skewer only works with a line piece (B, R, Q).

A chess or endgame study is a position which is made to show an interesting point. It is usual for studies to be endgame positions. Unlike chess problems, studies are connected to the game.

A term in positional chess, where a player loses ground because he/she has to make a move. See Zugzwang.

A series of symbols are in wide use. They help annotate games of chess.

Short-term attacks requiring exact calculation, sometimes called 'forcing sequences'. It is contrasted with positional play, which is long-term strategy.

In chess, a single move. A loss of a tempo would be taking two moves where one would do. This may, or may not, be critical in the early stages of a game.

Article 4 of the Laws of Chess. If the player to play touches a piece, it must be moved if possible. If there is no legal move, then the player may make any legal move. See also J'adoube, which permits adjustment of pieces without penalty.

To arrive at the same position from different move orders. Common in certain openings, such as the Modern defence.

A position, usually in an ending, where the player to move loses because he/she must move. A more complex definition is given by Hooper:

Emperor Chūai

No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty. 

Chūai is almost certainly a legend; but the "Kojiki" and "Nihonshoki" record his name. He was a grandson of Emperor Keikō. 

Chūai's wife is known as Empress Jingū. Her son would become known as Emperor Ōjin.

The limited information about Chūai does not imply that no such person ever existed. Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei. 

This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Chūai.

The actual site of his grave is not known. According to the Imperial Household Agency, this emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Nara.

The limited information about Jingū does not imply that no such person ever existed. Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.

After the death of Chūai, Jingū also served as regent until her son was old enough to be emperor. 
This empress' official name after his death (her posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Jingū.

According to the Imperial Household Agency, the empress's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun"). Jingū is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Nara. 

In the centuries before the Meiji period, Jingū was known as the 15th Japanese imperial ruler, according to the traditional order of succession. However, Jingū's name is now removed from the official list of emperors of Japan. Jingū's son, Emperor Ōjin, is today considered to have been the 15th emperor in the order of succession.

<doc id="236580" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=236580" title="Hypermodern">
Hypermodern

The hypermoderns were a school of chess players who set out to rethink some of the principles of chess openings. The name was given to them by the Polish-French grandmaster Tartakower.

The key idea was, in reaction to the older ideas of Siegbert Tarrasch, to dispute control of the centre by more subtle methods. Whereas old theory was to occupy the centre with two or three pawns immediately, the hypermoderns concentrated more on attacking the opponent's centre. A characteristic first move was 1Nf3 with White, or 1...Nf6 with Black, especially in reply to 1d4. To 1e4 they favoured an asymmetric defence such as 1...e6 or 1...c5 rather than the classical reply 1...e5. 

Nimzovich was the founder, and Alekhine, Tartakower, Réti, Grünfeld, and Bogolyubov all took part. All were top grandmasters of the 1920s and 30s. Several modern openings owe their popularity to this group: Alekhine's Defence (1e4 Nf6); Réti's Opening (1Nf3); the King's Indian Defence (1d4 Nf6 2c4 g6 3Nc3 Bg7); the Grünfeld Defence (1d4 Bf6 2c4 g6 3Nc3 d5) and the Modern Defence (1...g6).

<doc id="236592" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=236592" title="Confidence interval">
Confidence interval

In statistics a confidence interval is a measurement of how good, or how accurate a certain parameter is. Statistics is concerned with estimating values. In the case of confidence intervals, an interval is given instead of a single parameter, together with a likelihood that the observed value will be in the interval. The likelihood that the parameter will be in the interval given is called confidence level. Very often, this is given at a percentage. The confidence interval is always given together with the confidence level. People may speak about the "95% confidence interval". 
The end points of the confidence interval are referred to as confidence limits. For a given estimation procedure in a given situation, the higher the confidence level, the wider the confidence interval will be.

The calculation of a confidence interval generally requires assumptions about the nature of the estimation process – it is primarily a "parametric" method. One common assumption is that the distribution of the population from which the sample came is normal. As such, confidence intervals as discussed below are not robust statistics, though changes can be made to add robustness.

The term "confidence" has a different meaning in statistics, than it has in common use. This often confuses people and is one of the critiques to the concept of confidence intervals: If they are used by other people than statisticians, the term "confidence" is misleading. 

In common usage, a claim to 95% confidence in something is normally taken as indicating virtual certainty. In statistics, a claim to 95% confidence simply means that the researcher has seen something occur that only happens one time in twenty or less. If one were to roll two dice and get double six (which happens 1/36th of the time, or about 3%), few would claim this as proof that the dice were fixed, although statistically speaking one could have 97% confidence that they were. Similarly, the finding of a statistical link at 95% confidence is not proof, nor even very good evidence, that there is any real connection between the things linked.

When a study involves multiple statistical tests, some laymen assume that the confidence associated with each test is the confidence one should have in the results of the study itself. In fact, the results of all the statistical tests done during a study must be judged as a whole in order to determine what confidence one may place in the positive links it produces. For example, say a study is conducted which involves 40 statistical tests at 95% confidence, and which produces 3 positive results. Each test has a 5% chance of producing a false positive, so such a study will produce 3 false positives about two times in three. The confidence one can therefore have that any of the study's positive conclusions are correct is only about 32%, well below the 95% the researchers have set as their standard of acceptance.

A machine fills cups with margarine. For the example, the machine is adjusted so that the content of the cups is 250 g of margarine. As the machine cannot fill every cup with exactly 250 g, the content added to individual cups shows some variation, and is considered a random variable X. This variation is assumed to be normally distributed around the desired average of 250 g, with a standard deviation of 2.5 g. To determine if the machine is adequately calibrated, a sample of "n" = 25 cups of margarine is chosen at random and the cups are weighed. The weights of margarine are "X", ..., "X", a random sample from "X".

To get an impression of the expectation μ, it is sufficient to give an estimate. The appropriate estimator is the sample mean: 

The sample shows actual weights "x", ..., "x", with mean:

If we take another sample of 25 cups, we could easily expect to find values like 250.4 or 251.1 grams. A sample mean value of 280 grams however would be extremely rare if the mean content of the cups is in fact close to 250g. There is a whole interval around the observed value 250.2 of the sample mean within which, if the whole population mean actually takes a value in this range, the observed data would not be considered particularly unusual. Such an interval is called a confidence interval for the parameter "μ". How do we calculate such an interval? The endpoints of the interval have to be calculated from the sample, so they are statistics, functions of the sample "X", ..., "X" and hence random variables themselves.

In our case we may determine the endpoints by considering that the sample mean from a normally distributed sample is also normally distributed, with the same expectation "μ", but with standard error "σ"/√"n" = 0.5 (grams). By standardizing we get a random variable

dependent on the parameter μ to be estimated, but with a standard normal distribution independent of the parameter "μ". Hence it is possible to find numbers −"z" and "z", independent of "μ", where "Z" lies in between with probability 1 − α, a measure of how confident we want to be. We take 1 − α = 0.95. So we have:

The number "z" follows from the cumulative distribution function:

and we get:

This might be interpreted as: with probability 0.95 we will find a confidence interval in which we will meet the parameter "μ" between the stochastic endpoints 

and

This does not mean that there is 0.95 probability of meeting the parameter μ in the calculated interval. Every time the measurements are repeated, there will be another value for the mean  of the sample. In 95% of the cases "μ" will be between the endpoints calculated from this mean, but in 5% of the cases it will not be. The actual confidence interval is calculated by entering the measured weights in the formula. Our 0.95 confidence interval becomes:

As the desired value 250 of "μ" is within the resulted confidence interval, there is no reason to believe the machine is wrongly calibrated.

The calculated interval has fixed endpoints, where μ might be in between (or not). Thus this event has probability either 0 or 1. We cannot say: "with probability (1 − α) the parameter "μ" lies in the confidence interval." We only know that by repetition in 100(1 − α) % of the cases μ will be in the calculated interval. In 100α % of the cases however it does not. And unfortunately we do not know in which of the cases this happens. That's why we say: "with confidence level 100(1 − α) %, "μ" lies in the confidence interval."

The figure on the right shows 50 realisations of a confidence interval for a given population mean μ. If we randomly choose one realisation, the probability is 95% we end up having chosen an interval that contains the parameter; however we may be unlucky and have picked the wrong one. We'll never know; we are stuck with our interval.

Some scholars identify him with King San in the Book of Song. King San sent messengers to the Song Dynasty at least twice in 421 and 425; and this historical person was succeeded by his younger brother.

No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty. 

According to "Nihonshoki" and "Kojiki", he was the first son of Emperor Nintoku.

Richū had two sons; but he was followed on the throne by his brother, who would become known as Emperor Hanzei. The enthronement of Hanzei by-passed Richū's two sons. Few other details have survived.

Two of Richū's grandsons would attain the throne as Emperor Kenzō and as Emperor Ninken.

Very little is known about the events of Richū's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei. 

In his sixth year of his reign, Richū died. 

This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Richū. 

According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun") at Sakai. Richū is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") which is associated with the burial mound.

Jacobitism

Jacobitism was (and, to a much smaller extent, is) the political movement that tried to put the Stuart kings back onto the thrones of England, Scotland, and Kingdom of Ireland. The movement took its name from the Latin form "Jacobus" of the name of King James II and VII. 

Jacobitism began after the deposition of James II and VII in 1688. He was replaced by his daughter Mary II jointly with her husband and first cousin William of Orange. The Stuarts lived on the European mainland after that, sometimes trying to get back the throne with the help of France or Spain. The most important places of Jacobitism were Ireland and Scotland, especially the Scottish Highlands. In England, Jacobitism was strongest in the north, and some support was also in Wales.

A great number of Catholic people liked Jacobitism. They hoped the Stuarts would end bad laws. Lots of different helped the military campaigns for all sorts of reasons. In Scotland the Jacobite cause became a lasting romantic memory.

John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough

John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (26 May 1650 – 16 June 1722) was an important English soldier and statesman. He lived through the rules of five monarchs through the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Rising from a lowly page at the court of the House of Stuart, he faithfully served the Duke of York through the 1670s and early 1680s. This gave him military and political advancement through his brave, clever skill. Churchill helped secure James on the throne. However, just three years later he left his Catholic teacher for the Protestant Dutchman, William of Orange. He was honored for his services at William's coronation with the earldom of Marlborough (pronounced /'mɔ:l bɹə/). He served in the early years of the Nine Years' War and became famous. However, charges of Jacobitism made him fall from office. For some time, he was in the Tower. When Queen Anne came to throne in 1702, however, Marlborough secured his fame and lots of money. 

His marriage to the quick-tempered Sarah Jennings – Anne's close friend – helped Marlborough's rise. He first became the Captain-Generalcy of British forces. Then he became a duke. Later, he became the richest of all Anne's subjects. Although in the end he could not completely crush his enemies, his victories allowed Britain to rise to very great power. Through him, the country grew more and more rich through the 18th century.

The Baboon is the largest type of monkey. It is a noisy, ferocious, ground-dwelling Old World monkey that lives in groups called troops. Troops vary in size from a few individuals to up to several hundred members.

Baboons live in savannas, open woods, grasslands, rocky areas, and dry lands, in Africa and on the Arabian Peninsula. These intelligent primates are endangered due to loss of habitat.

Baboons are omnivores (they eat both plants and meat). They eat grasses, roots, insects and other small animals, including lizards, small mammals, and snakes.

Leopards, cheetahs, wild dogs, and people hunt the baboon. When a baboon is threatened by a predator, it will run away or bark loudly and bare its large teeth.

Irukandji jellyfish

The Irukandji Jellyfish, "Carukia barnesi", is a species of jellyfish. It lives in the waters of northern Australia. It is a very deadly jellyfish. The Irukandji is only 2.5 centimeters (with bell and tentacles) in diameter. This makes it hard to find. The Irukandji is believed to be the most poisonous in the world. Some people are not sure if that is true. 

The Irukandjis' name comes from an Australian Aboriginal tribe. The tribe lived in the Palm Cove region of North Queensland. When the Irukandji people were stung by the Irukandji, there are many . This includes:

Sometimes, people may also get on their lungs (pulmonary oedema), hypertension, and heart failure.

The Irukandji has killed at least two swimmers in Australia. In 2002, Richard Jordon came to Australia as a tourist. He was a 58 year old British man. He was stung while swimming off Hamilton Island. Jordon died a few days later. There may have been more deaths which doctors did not know were caused by the jellyfish.

The Irukandji is related to another jellyfish. This is the box jellyfish, "Chironex Fleckeri". Irukandji was identified in 1964 by a Cairns doctor, Jack Barnes. Because of this, its scientific name is named after him. When people were getting hurt in the sea, Barnes was sure it was because of a jellyfish. He put on diving equipment and lay on the sea floor for six days until he discovered it. When Barnes discovered the Irukandji jellyfish, he tested its sting on himself, his son, and a lifeguard. They all had to be taken to the hospital.

Irukandji has stingers - not only on its tentacles, but also on its bell. It is very small and weak. Because of this, sudden force may kill it. So, it cannot be kept in a normal aquarium. The first Irukandji jellyfish in was born in Townsville, Queensland.

The AWB also wants to get back the apartheid, or at least some of them want it. And they want to end the killing of white people by black people. The organisation is not violent, but it used to be back in the 1990s.

He played matches for the World Chess Championship twice against Alekhine, losing 15.5–9.5 in 1929, and 15.5–10.5 in 1934.

He represented Germany at first board in the 4th Chess Olympiad at Prague 1931, winning the individual silver medal (+9 –1 =7). Bogoljubov continued to have good tournament results throughout the 1930s.

During World War II, he lost a match to Euwe (+2 –5 =3) at Krefeld 1941, and drew a mini-match with Alekhine (+1 –1 =0) at Warsaw 1943. He also played in numerous tournaments held in Nazi-held territorry throughout the war. After the war, he lived in West Germany. In 1947, he won in Lüneburg, and Kassel. In 1949 he won in Bad Pyrmont (3rd West GER-ch), and tied for 1st-2nd in Oldenburg. In 1951, he won in Augsburg, and Saarbrücken.

Adelong, New South Wales

Adelong is a small town in the Snowy Mountains region of New South Wales, Australia. It is a part of the Tumut Shire. About 1400 people live in the Adelong district, and 829 people live in the town. The town is about 160 kilometres west of Canberra on the Snowy Mountains Highway. The town's name comes from an Aboriginal word meaning "along the way" or "plain with a river".

Hamilton Hume and William Hovell were the first Europeans in to visit the area on their way back to Sydney in 1825. They described it as "rough and difficult country."
Adelong was settled between 1840 to 1850. Gold was discovered at Adelong by a William Williams in 1857. The gold was on the top of Victoria Hill and was part of the Old Hill Reef. Alluvial gold was found in both Adelong Creek and Golden Gully in the same year. Adelong quickly became an important goldfield. Adelong Post Office opened on 1 January 1859. 

By 1859 a number of gold reefs were being mined, including the Old Reef and the Great Victoria Mine. Between 1859 and 1876, 3,798 kilograms of gold was mined. During the gold rush the population grew to more than 30,000 people. Over 25 tonnes of gold was mined from 1857 to the close of the mines in 1914. The National Trust of Australia has listed the main street of Adelong and a number of buildings as being important historical places.

A number of narrow tramway tracks were built in the mine area. Adelong is one of the only two gold mining areas in New South Wales known to have used a steam locomotive on its tramways.
During the gold rush many Chinese people worked in the mines. Many died and were buried in a special part of the Adelong cemetery. The Chinese part of the cemetery was destroyed in the early 1900s. One or two old Chinese and Indian people still lived in Adelong in the 1950s. A small town, Cornishtown, was about a mile west of Adelong till the 1940's .

After the gold rush, farming became the main business in the area. This was mainly Merino sheep and beef cattle. Over the last 20 years a tourists have come to visit because of the pleasant scenery and gold mining history. The famous Adelong Falls, with its rich gold-mining past, is an ideal spot to for a picnic or to explore the local area.

Johan Anthoniszoon "Jan" van Riebeeck (April 21, 1619 – January 18, 1677) was a Dutch colonial administrator and founder of Cape Town.

Van Riebeeck was born in Culemborg in the Netherlands as the son of a surgeon. He grew up in Schiedam, where he married 19-year old Maria de la Quellerie on 28 March 1649. (She died in Malacca, now part of Malaysia, on 2 November 1664, at the age of 35). The couple had eight children, most of whom did not live through . Their son Abraham van Riebeeck, born at the Cape, later became Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies.

Joining the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1639, he served in many posts, like an assistant surgeon in the Batavia in the East Indies. He then went to Japan. His most important position was that of head of the VOC trading post in Tonkin, Vietnam. However, he was called back from this post as it was found that he was working trade for his own account.

In 1651 he was asked to undertake the command of the initial Dutch settlement in the future South Africa. He landed three ships "Drommedaris", "Reijger" and "Goede Hoop" at the future Cape Town on 6 April 1652 and strongly make the site as a way-station for the VOC trade route between the Netherlands and the East Indies. The "Walvisch" and the "Oliphant" came later, having had 130 burials at sea.

Measles

Measles is an infectious disease, caused by a virus. People catch measles from other people. It is passed on in tiny drops of water when people breathe. People with measles have a sore throat, a fever, a cough, red eyes and a runny nose. They also have a bumpy red rash all over their body.

Measles is very infectious, which means it is easy to catch. If someone in a house has measles, it is very likely that other people in the house will also get it. In developed countries, lots of children have a vaccination (injection) to stop them from getting measles. Often they are given the MMR vaccine, to stop them getting measles, mumps and rubella. The three vaccinations are all in one injection.

Measles is sometimes also called "rubeola", but it is not the same as rubella (German measles).

There is no cure for measles. People with measles may rest and take medicines to make them feel better, to stop pain and make fevers go away. Most people that have measles recover, but some people die from it.

Emperor Seinei

No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.

According to "Kojiki" and "Nihonshoki", Seinei was a son of Emperor Yūryaku. 

Seinei fathered no children. He adopted two grandsons of Emperor Richū. Each would attain the throne; and they would become known as Emperor Ninken and as Emperor Kenzo

Very little is known about the events of Seinei's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei. 

After the death of his father, Seinei overcame others in the struggle for power. 

This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Seinei. 

According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun"). This emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") which is associated with the burial mound.

Xiphactinus

Xiphactinus (from Latin and Greek for "sword-ray") was a large, 4.5 to 5 m (15 to 20 feet) long predatory bony fish that lived in the Western Interior Sea, over what is now the middle of North America, during the Late Cretaceous. Skeletal remains of Xiphactinus have come from Kansas, Alabama, and Georgia in the United States, as well as Europe and Australia.
Above all else, "Xiphactinus" was a great swimmer, able to speed towards or away from virtually anything else in the seas of the time. It may have been able to leap above the waves at times to help dislodge parasites from its skin. It was not however immune from attack. If injured, its large size meant it was easy to spot and could become prey for sharks.

Chess and computers

Chess and computers have been connected since the earliest days of the computer. In the 19th century Charles Babbage had thought of the idea, and in modern times Alan Turing, the mathematician and Bletchley Park codebreaker, put some thought into the idea. He was not a very good chess player, but was one of the creators of the first British computer. He is also credited with the creation of Computer science.

There are two types of chess programs. One plays against a human opponent; the other helps the user become a better player. The two types can be made to work together, though they have different functions and work in different ways.

Chess engines are computer systems that can play chess games against human opponents. Many have been created; they can play at master level, though their processes are quite different from those of a human being.<ref name="H/W">Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. "The Oxford companion to chess". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.</ref> The best engines on the fastest computers have won matches against both Kasparov and Kramnik, but the software can be used at an easier level for a learner.

Competitions are run by putting engines against each other, and the results are published. There is a World Computer Chess Championship, in which the details of the rules may determine which software wins. Software may also be rated on other scales, such as ease of usage.

Fritz is a German chess program by Frans Morsch and Mathias Feist, published by ChessBase. It is the current market leader. There is also a different kind of Fritz called "Deep Fritz" that is made for multi-processing. The latest kinds of the consumer products are Deep Fritz 12 and Fritz 12. They came with reviews by Josh Waitzkin, who said that "Fritz is like a woman that you can't get with. It just drives (makes) you to think in ways you've never thought before".

Shredder is a leading engine. It is also owned by ChessBase. It comes in various forms: Shredder 12, Deep Shredder 12; Shredder Classic. It has a reputation of being hard.

Rybka, a product by Vasik Rajlich, is Shredder's main rival. Rybka 4 is their latest version.

Chess databases do not actually play. They give access to the recorded history of master chess. There are two components. First, there is the software, which lets one search and organise the database material. Then there is the actual database, typically one to four million games.

In practice, databases are used for two purposes. First, for a player to train his/her ability at specific openings. Second, to look up specific opponents to see what they play, and prepare against them beforehand.

The existence of chess databases is one way that young players can achieve mastery at an early age.

ChessBase is the biggest database, and widely used by masters. Although it can be used online, most users download the software and data onto their laptop. Then they take the laptop to tournaments, to help prepare for games. Players may not use computers or any other aid during games, but much preparation goes on behind the scenes. ChessBase has to be purchased, and it is not cheap.

This is a Dutch magazine for advanced players, which runs an on-line database called NicBase as part of its services. NicBase is free, and has over a million games.

Chessgames.com runs an on-line database of games. It is partly free, but requires registration. Full access to all its facilities is by a fairly modest subscription. It has over half a million games on its database.

There are websites which a player can join (for a fee) and play on line. In this case, the subscriber will play against other subscribers, not a computer. All standards of players are amongst the members, and various events are on offer at different rates of play. The two leaders in this market are:

Chess notation

Chess notation is a method for writing down chess moves. It is compulsory for payers in competitions to do this. The system must have these elements: the move number, the piece moved, the square it starts from (optional), the square it goes to, and other relevant information such as captures, and castles.<ref name="H/W">Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. "The Oxford companion to chess". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.</ref> There are other notations for recording positions.

There have been ways of describing moves from quite early on. Manuscripts with move descriptions are known in Arabic (9th century) and from Europe (13th century). These early notations are usually quite cumbersome; "The pawn of the king forward two houses". This kind of notation is called "descriptive". In a descriptive notation each player describes squares from his own point of view, e.g. 1 P–K4 P–K4. A notation which uses labels for the ranks and files is called "algebraic". In this notation a square has only one label, e.g. 1 e4 e5.

The moves of a chess game are written down by using a special notation. Usually algebraic chess notation is used. In algebraic notation, each square has one and only one name (whether you are looking from White's side of the board or Black's). Here, moves are written in the format of: abbreviation of the piece moved – file where it moved – rank where it moved. For example, Qg5 means "queen moves to the g-file and 5th rank" (that is, to the square g5). If there are two pieces of the same type that can move to the same square, one more letter or number is added to show the file or rank from which the piece moved, e.g. Ngf3 means "knight from the g-file moves to the square f3". The letter P showing a pawn is not used, so that e4 means "pawn moves to the square "e4"".

If the piece makes a capture, "x" is written before the square in which the capturing piece lands on. Example: "Bxf3" means "bishop captures on f3". When a pawn makes a capture, the file from which the Pawn left is used in place of a piece initial. For example: exd5 means "pawn captures on d5."

If a pawn moves to its eighth rank, getting a promotion, the piece chosen is written after the move, for example e1Q or e1=Q. Castling is written by the special notations 0–0 for kingside castling and 0–0–0 for queenside. A move which places the opponent's king in check normally has the notation "+" added. Checkmate can be written as # or ++. At the end of the game, 1–0 means "White won", 0–1 means "Black won" and ½-½ is a draw.

Chess moves can also be shown with punctuation marks and other annotation symbols. For example: ! means a good move, !! means a very good move, ? means a bad move, ?? a very bad move (sometimes called a "blunder"), !? a creative move that may be good, and ?! a doubtful move. For example, one kind of a simple "trap" known as the Scholar's mate, as in the diagram to the right, may be recorded in full notation:

1. e2-e4 e7-e5<br>
2. Qd1-h5?! Nc8-c6<br>
3. Bf1-c4 Ng8-f6?? (3...Qe7 is better)<br>
4. Qh5xf7# 1–0

Here is a famous short game in the more usual short notation:

This is algebraic notation with little figurines instead of initial letters for the pieces. Figurine notation is used in print and computer chess. Since it avoids initial letters for pieces, it is more international.


In addition to the Forsyth notation, positions may be recorded in this simple fashion:

<doc id="236889" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=236889" title="Akiba Rubinstein">
Akiba Rubinstein

Akiba Rubinstein (Stawiski, Poland, 12 December 1882 – 15 March 1961, Antwerp, Belgium) was a Polish chess Grandmaster in the first part of the 20th century. Around 1910 he was one of the three best players in the world.

Rubinstein was Jewish, and his family planned for him to become a rabbi. However, he did not finish his studies, and chose to devote himself to chess entirely. The decision came in 1903 after he won fifth place at a tournament in Kiev. He learned to play chess when he was 16,<ref name="H/W">Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. "The Oxford Companion to Chess". Oxford.</ref> and played with the strong master Gersz Salwe in Łódź. 

Rubinstein's best period was from 1907 to 1912. It began with his win at Karlovy Vary in 1907, and a shared win at St. Petersburg in the same year. It closed in a string of wins in 1912. He won five consecutive major tournaments that year: San Sebastian, Piešťany, Breslau (the German championship), Warsaw and Vilnius (although none of these events included Lasker or Capablanca). Some believe that he was better than World Champion Emanuel Lasker at this time. Ratings from "Chessmetrics" support this conclusion, placing him as world #1 between mid 1912 and mid 1914. Others believe he was not quite so strong as Lasker, and was eclipsed by José Raúl Capablanca after 1911.

Rubinstein was never given a chance to play Lasker for the world chess championship: he was unable to raise enough money to meet Lasker's financial demands. In the 1909 St. Petersburg tournament, he had tied with Lasker and won his individual encounter with him. However, he had a poor result at St. Petersburg tournament 1914, not reaching the final pool of five players. A match with Lasker was arranged for October 1914, but it never took place because of the outbreak of World War I.

After the war Rubinstein was still an elite grandmaster, but his results lacked their previous formidable consistency. Nevertheless, he won at Vienna in 1922, ahead of future world champion Alexander Alekhine, and was the leader of the Polish team that won the Chess Olympiad at Hamburg in 1930 with a superb record of thirteen wins and four draws. A year later he won an Olympic silver. 

After 1932 he withdrew from tournament play, mostly because his symptoms of schizophrenia prevented normal life. He suffered from a fear of people and society. He lived then in a sanitorium, and later rejoined his family. 

Rubinstein lived on for almost 30 years afterwards. He left behind no literary works (perhaps because of his mental problems), but a great heritage in his games. During World War II he was placed in an asylum. One account says that when the Nazis eventually arrived to haul the aged Jewish grandmaster from his asylum to the death camps, he was so patently insane that they abandoned the attempt.

He was one of the earliest chess players to take the endgame into account when choosing and playing the opening. He was exceptionally talented in the endgame, particularly in rook endings, where he broke new ground. Silman ranks him as one of the five best endgame players of all time, and a master of rook endgames.

He originated the Rubinstein System against the Tarrasch variation of the Queen's Gambit declined: 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 c5 3.c4 e6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.g3 Nf6 7.Bg2 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qb6 (Rubinstein - Tarrasch, 1912). He is also credited with inventing the Meran variation, which stems from the Slav defence.

Today, he certainly has no shortage of lines named for him. 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3. is the Rubinstein variation of the Nimzo-Indian defence.

The Rubinstein Trap, a trap in the Queen's Gambit declined is named after him because he fell into it twice. One version of the trap runs 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Bg5 Be7 6.e3 0-0 7.Nf3 Nbd7 8.Bd3 c6 10.0-0 Re8 11.Rc1 h6 12. Bf4 Nh5? 13. Nxd5! Now 13...cxd5?? is met by 14.Bc7, winning the queen, while 13...Nxf4 14.Nxf4 leaves White a pawn ahead. 

The Rubinstein Memorial tournament in his honor has been held annually since 1963 in Polanica Zdroj, with a glittering list of top-flight winners.

Martín Chambi

Martín Chambi Jiménez was a photographer who came from the south of Peru. He was also known as Martín Chambi de Coaza. He was the only well known indigenous Latin American photographer of his time. He was born November 5, 1891 in Puno (a city in Peru) and died September 13, 1973 in the city of Cusco.

He is considered one of the great figures of American photography.

Chambi is famous for the historic and social value of his photographs. He was a portrait photographer in the cities and the countryside of the Peruvian Andes. He was the leading portrait photographer in the Andean city of Cusco. Chambi also took many landscape photographs, and he sold these photographs as postcards. He was one of the first to use the postcard format in Peru. 

In 1979, MOMA in New York had a Chambi exhibition. The exhibition later moved to various locations. It inspired other international exhibitions of his work.

"It is wrong to focus too much on the "testimonial" (historical) value of his photos. They have that, indeed, but, in equal measure they express the "milieu" (society) in which he lived and they show (...) that when he was behind a camera, he became a giant, a true inventor, a force of invention, a recreator of life."
- Mario Vargas Llosa

"I've read that in Chile they think that the indigenous South American peoples have no culture, that they are not civilised, that they are intellectually and artistically inferior to European white peoples. The artworks are a graphic testament that is more eloquent than my own opinion, always. I hope that this testament will be examined fairly and objectively. I feel I am representing my race; my people will speak through the photographs."
- Martín Chambi, 1936

Martín Chambi was born in a poor Quechua family. He was born in one of the poorest parts of Peru, at the end of the nineteenth century. His father worked in a gold mine by the River Inambari. Martín sometimes went to work with his father too. He saw his first photographer there at the mine. Chambi learned the basic techniques from a photographer at the Santo Domingo Mine. This meeting fired his ambition.

Chambi tried to work as a professional photographer after this. He traveled to the city of Arequipa in 1908, where photography was more developed. Many professional photographers lived in Areqiupa. They had developed individual photographic styles and professional techniques.

Chambi was an apprentice in the studio of Max T. Vargas. After nine years he created his own studio in Sicuani in 1917. He published his first postcards in November 1917. 

In 1923 he moved to Cusco and opened a studio there. In Cusco he photographed rich society people and poor indigenous people. During his career, Chambi also travelled all over the Andes. He photographed the landscapes, Inca ruins, and local people. Chambi was with the American explorer Hiram Bingham when Bingham "discovered" Machu Picchu, the great Inca monument.

1977 - Chambi's photographs are archived and restored for the first time, financed by the Earthwatch Foundation (Belmont, Massachusetts). This marks the beginning of international fame.

1979 - Retrospective exhibition at MOMA in New York City.

1981 - Latin American photography exhibition in Zurich.

1986 - BBC Arena film "Martín Chambi and The Heirs of the Incas" is shown worldwide.

Reception history of Jane Austen

The reception history of Jane Austen shows how Austen's works, at first having modest fame, became wildly popular. Her books are both the subject of great study and the center of various fan culture. Jane Austen, the writer of such works as "Pride and Prejudice" (1813) and "Emma" (1815), has become one of the most famous novelists in the English language.

During her lifetime, Austen's books did not make her very famous. Like a great number of women writers at that time, she chose to publish her books secretly. Only among people in the aristocracy, her writing was an open secret. At the time they were published, Austen's works were thought fashionable by members of high society. However, they received only a few good reviews. By the mid-nineteenth century, her works were respected by people who were learned in literature. They thought that liking her works was a sign that they were clever. In 1870, her nephew published "Memoir of Jane Austen". This showed her to a wider public as "dear, quiet aunt Jane". After this, her works were published again in popular editions. By the twentieth century, lots of groups had formed. Some praised her and some defended her from the " masses". However, they all claimed to be true Janeites, or people who really appreciated Austen.

Early in the twentieth century, scholars made a collection of her works (the first for any British novelist). But it was not until the 1940s that Austen was widely accepted as a "great English novelist". In the second half of the twentieth century, people began studying Austen more and more, and in different ways. For example, they studied her works artistically, ideologically, and historically. The university English departments began developing in the first half of the twentieth century. As they grew, criticism of Austen split into remarkable high culture and popular culture trends. In the late twentieth century, fans made Jane Austen societies and clubs. They praised Austen, her time, and her works. In the early twenty-first century, Austen fans support an industry of printed sequels and prequels. They also support Austen's work in television and film.

Jane Austen lived her entire life as part of a large and close family. Her family was in the lower part of the English gentry. Her family's steady support was very important to Austen's development as a writer. For example, Austen read her first drafts of all of her books to her family. In this way, she received encouragement and help. In fact, it was her father who first tried to put her book in print. Austen's training as a writer lasted from when she was a teenager until she was about 35. During this time, she experimented with different literary forms. This included the epistolary novel (novel in letters), which she tried and did not like. She wrote and revised three important novels and began a fourth. When "Sense and Sensibility" (1811), "Pride and Prejudice" (1813), "Mansfield Park" (1814) and "Emma" (1815) came out in print, she became a successful writer.

However, novel-writing was not easy for women in the early nineteenth century. This was because it made them famous. It also made people think them . So like a great number of other female writers, Austen published her books secretly. In time, though, her writing became an open secret among the aristocracy. In one of her visits to London, the Prince Regent invited her to his home. His librarian showed her around and said that the Regent liked her books very much. The librarian added that "if Miss Austen had any other Novel forthcoming, she was quite at liberty to it to the Prince". Austen did not like the prince, who spent a lot of money. She did not want to follow this suggestion. However, her friends persuaded her to follow it. Therefore, "Emma" was dedicated to him. Austen refused the librarian's suggestion after that to write a historical romance for the prince's daughter's marriage.

In the last year of her life, Austen revised "Northanger Abbey" (1817) and wrote "Persuasion" (1817). She also began another novel, which was later titled "Sanditon". She could not finish it before her death. Austen did not have time to see "Northanger Abbey" or "Persuasion" through the press. However, her family published them as one book after she died. Her brother Henry included a "Biographical Notice of the Author". This short biography made people think of Austen as a quiet aunt who wrote in her free time. "Neither the hope of fame nor profit mixed with her early motives (purposes) ... [S]o much did she from , that no accumulation of fame would have induced (made) her, had she lived, to affix (put) her name to any productions of her public she turned away from any allusion to the character of an authoress." However, Austen shows excitement in her letters about getting her books in print. She was also interested in how much money the books would make. Austen was a professional writer.

Austen's works are noted for their realism, biting social commentary, and clever use of free indirect speech. They are also remarkable for their burlesque and irony. They criticize the novels of sensibility of the second half of the eighteenth century. They are part of the change to nineteenth-century realism. As Susan Gubar and Sandra Gilbert explain, Austen laughed at "love at first sight, the primacy (first importance) of passion over all other emotions and/or duties, the of the hero, the sensitivity of the heroine, the lovers' proclaimed (declared) indifference to financial considerations, and the cruel of parents". Austen's stories, though comic, focus on the way women depend on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. She was also concerned with moral problems, like Samuel Johnson, who strongly influenced her.

Austen's books quickly became fashionable. Aristocrats who liked to set the fashion and taste of the day especially liked them. Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough wrote about "Sense and Sensibility" in a letter to a friend. She said: "it is a clever novel.  ... tho' it ends stupidly, I was much amused by it." The 15-year-old daughter of the Prince Regent, Princess Charlotte Augusta, compared herself to Marianne Dashwood. She remarked, "I think Marianne & me are very like in "disposition", that certainly I am not so good, the same , &tc". "Pride and Prejudice" was enjoyed by Richard Sheridan, a person who wrote plays. He told a friend to "[b]uy it immediately" for it "was one of the cleverest things" he had ever read. Anne Milbanke, future wife of Lord Byron, wrote that "I have finished the Novel called Pride and Prejudice, which I think a very superior (good) work." She added that "is the most "probable" fiction I have ever read" and had become "at present the fashionable novel". The Dowager Lady Vernon told a friend that "Mansfield Park" was "[n]ot much of a novel, more the history of a family party in the country, very natural". Lady Anne Romilly told her friend, the writer Maria Edgeworth, that "["Mansfield Park"] has been pretty generally admired here". Edgeworth later said that "we have been much entertained with Mansfield Park".

High society liked and approved of Austen's novels. However, they received few reviews while she was alive. There were two for "Sense and Sensibility". "Pride and Prejudice" received three. "Mansfield Park" received none. There were seven for "Emma". Most of the reviews were short, careful, and approving. They mostly focused on the moral lessons of her books. Brian Southam writes about these reviewers: "their job was merely to provide brief (short) notices, extended with quotations, for the benefit (good) of women readers compiling their library lists and interested only in knowing whether they would like a book for its story, its characters and moral". 

Famous writer Walter Scott wrote the longest and deepest of these reviews. He was asked by publisher John Murray to review "Emma". "Emma" had come out in print (without saying who the writer was) in the March 1816 issue of the "Quarterly Review". Using the review as a way to praise the novel, Scott praised Austen's works. He praised her ability to copy "from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the correct and striking of that which is daily (every day) taking place around him". Modern Austen scholar William Galperin has noted that "unlike some of Austen's lay readers, who recognized her divergence (difference) from realistic practice as it had been prescribed and defined at the time, Walter Scott may well have been the first to install Austen as the realist par excellence". Scott wrote in his private journal in 1826 about Austen. This later became a widely quoted comparison:

Also read again and for the third time at least Miss Austen's very finely written novel of "Pride and Prejudice". That young lady had a talent for describing the and feelings and characters of ordinary life which is to me the most wonderful I ever met with. The Big Bow-wow strain I can do myself like any now going, but the exquisite touch which renders (makes) ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting from the truth of the description and the sentiment is denied to me. What a pity such a gifted creature died so early!

"Northanger Abbey" and "Persuasion" were published together in December 1817. They were reviewed in the "British Critic" in March 1818 and in the "Edinburgh Review and Literary Miscellany" in May 1818. The reviewer for the "British Critic" felt that Austen's great use of realism was proof of a limited imagination. The reviewer for the "Edinburgh Review" thought differently. He praised Austen for her " invention". He was also pleased with Austen's stories because they mixed familiar scenes with surprising twists. Austen scholars have pointed out that these early reviewers did not know what to make of her works. For example, they wrongly understood her use of irony. Reviewers thought "Sense and Sensibility" and "Pride and Prejudice" were stories of virtue overcoming vice.

In the "Quarterly Review" in 1821 another review came out. Richard Whately was an English writer and theologican. He published the most serious early review of Austen's work. Whately compared Austen and great writers such as Homer and Shakespeare with favor. He praised the dramatic quality of her stories. He also said that the novel was a real, respectable genre of literature. He argued that imaginative literature, especially , was very valuable. He even said they were more important than history or biography. When it was well done, as Austen's works were, Whately said that novels wrote about human experience that the reader could learn from. In other words, he believed that it was moral. Whately also addressed Austen's position as a female writer. He wrote: "we suspect one of Miss Austin's ["sic"] great merits in our eyes to be, the insight she gives us into the peculiarities of female heroines are what one knows women must be, though one never can get them to acknowledge (admit) it." No better criticism of Austen was put in print until the late nineteenth century. Whately and Scott had begun the Victorian era's view of Austen.

Austen had a great number of readers who liked and respected her in the nineteenth century. According to critic Ian Watt, they liked her " to ordinary (usual) social experience". However, Austen's works were not exactly what her Romantic and Victorian British audience liked. They wished for "powerful emotion [be] authenticated by an egregious display of sound and color in the writing". Victorian critics and audiences liked the work of writers like Charles Dickens and George Eliot. Compared to them, Austen's works seemed narrow and quiet. Austen's works were put in print again beginning in late 1832 or early 1833. Richard Bentley printed them in the "Standard Novels" series, and remained in print for a long time after that. However, they were not bestsellers. Southam describes her "reading public between 1821 and 1870" as "minute beside the known audience for Dickens and his contemporaries".

The people who read Austen saw themselves as clever readers. They were the few. This became a well-known theme of Austen criticism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. George Henry Lewes was a philosopher and literary critic. He spoke about this theme in a series of articles in the 1840s and 1850s. "The Novels of Jane Austen" was put in print in "Blackwood's Magazine" in 1859. In there, Lewes praised Austen's books for "the economy of easy adaptation of means to ends, with no aid (help) from superfluous elements". He also compared her to Shakespeare. He argued that Austen was not good at making up plots. However, he still enjoyed the dramatic quality of her works. He said: "The reader's pulse never throbs, his curiosity is never intense (very strong); but his interest never wanes (stops) for a moment. The action begins; the people speak, feel, and act; everything that is said, felt, or done tends towards the entanglement or disentanglement of the plot; and we are almost made actors as well as spectators (viewers) of the little drama."

Writer Charlotte Brontë liked Austen's writing because they were truthful about everyday life. However, Brontë called her "only shrewd (clever) and observant". She said there was not enough passion in her work. To Brontë, Austen's work seemed formal and narrow. In a letter written to G.H. Lewes in 1848, Brontë said that she did not like "Pride and Prejudice". She said:

Soon after Austen's works were printed in Britain, they appeared in some European countries. They began appearing in 1813 with a French translation of "Pride and Prejudice". It was quickly followed by German, Dutch, and Swedish editions. They were not always easy to get in Europe. Austen was not well known in Russia. The first Russian translation of an Austen novel did not appear until 1967. Austen’s works were translated into various European languages. However, Europeans did not see her works as part of the English novel tradition. This was partly because of the changes made by translators. They put in sentimentalism into Austen's works. They also failed to put in her humor and irony. Therefore, European readers more often thought of Walter Scott's style as the English novel.

The great changes made by her translators made the Continent receive Austen differently than in Britain. For example, the French writer Isabelle de Montolieu translated several of Austen's novels into the French sentimental novel. In Montolieu's "Pride and Prejudice", conversations (talks) between Elizabeth and Darcy were replaced by calm, proper ones. In Jane Austen's work, Elizabeth said that she has "always seen a great similarity in the turn of [their] minds" (her and Darcy's). She says this is because they are "unwilling to speak, unless [they] expect to say something that will amaze (surprise) the whole room". However, this becomes "Moi, je garde le silence, parce que je ne sais que dire, et vous, parce que vous aiguisez vos traits pour parler avec effet." ("Me, I keep silent, because I don't know what to say, and you, because you excite your features for effect when speaking.") Cossy and Saglia explained, "the equality of mind which Elizabeth takes for granted is denied (not given) and gender distinction introduced". Austen’s works were seen in France as part of a sentimental tradition. Because of this, people were more interested in the works of French realists like Stendhal, Balzac, and Flaubert. Austen was also treated as a romantic writer in Germany.

For years, people thought the same of Austen as Scott and Whately. Only a few people actually read her novels. In 1870 the first important Austen biography, "A Memoir of Jane Austen", was written by Jane Austen's nephew, James Edward Austen-Leigh and printed. This changed the way people thought of Austen. When it came out in print, Austen's popularity and critical standing increased greatly. The "Memoir" made people think of an untrained writer who wrote . People thought Austen was a quiet, middle-aged unmarried aunt. This made them feel that her works were safe for respectable Victorian families to read. The "Memoir" made Austen's books be printed again in great numbers. The first popular editions came out in 1883. They were a cheap series printed by Routledge. This was followed by editions with pictures, collectors' sets, and scholarly editions. However, critics still said that only people who could really understand the deep meaning of Austen's books should read them. However, after the "Memoir" was printed, much more criticism about Austen was printed. More came out in two years than had come out in the last 50 years.

In 1913, William Austen-Leigh and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh printed a family biography. It was titled: "Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters—A Family Record". William and Arthur were both part of the Austen family. It was based mostly on family papers and letters. It is described by Austen biographer Park Honan as ", staid (steady), , and at times vivid and suggestive". The authors moved away from the sentimental tone of the "Memoir". However, they did not go much beyond the family records and traditions they always had. Therefore, their book offers only facts. It does not offer much interpretation.

In the last part of the nineteenth century, the first critical books about Austen's works were printed. In 1890 Godwin Smith printed the "Life of Jane Austen". This began a "fresh phase in the critical ". This began "formal (official) criticism". People began focusing on Austen as a writer and analyzing the ways that made her writing special. Southam said that there was much more Austen criticism around 1780. He also said that the reviews became better. However, he was troubled at the "certain uniformity" in them:

We see the novels praised for their elegance of form and their surface 'finish'; for the realism of their fictional world, the variety and vitality (strength) of their characters; for their pervasive humour; and for their gentle and undogmatic morality and its unsermonising delivery. The novels are prized for their 'perfection'. Yet it is seen to be a narrow perfection, achieved within the bounds of domestic comedy.

Richard Simpson, Margaret Oliphant, and Leslie Stephen were some of the best reviewers. In a review of the "Memoir", Simpson said Austen was a serious but ironic critic of English society. He began two interpretative themes: using humor to criticize society and irony as a means of moral study. He continued Lewes's comparison to Shakespeare, and wrote that Austen:

began by being an ironical critic; she manifested her by direct censure, but by the indirect method of imitating and exaggerating the faults of her , humour, irony, the judgment not of one that gives sentence but of the mimic who quizzes while he mocks, are her characteristics.
Simpson's essay was not well-known. It did not a lot of influence until Lionel Trilling quoted it in 1957. Margaret Oliphant was another important writer whose criticism of Austen did not have much influence. She described Austen as "armed with a 'fine vein of feminine cynicism,' 'full of subtle power, keenness, finesse, and self-restraint (control),' with an 'exquisite sense' of the 'ridiculous,' 'a fine stinging yet soft-voiced contempt,' whose works are very 'calm and cold and keen'". This kind of criticism was not fully developed until the 1970s. This was when feminist literary criticism began.

Austen's works had been in print in the United States from 1832. However, it was only after 1870 that Americans began seriously considering Austen's works. As Southam says, "for American literary nationalists Jane Austen's cultivated scene was too , too constrained, too refined, too downright unheroic". Austen was not democratic enough for Americans. Also, her books did not have the frontier themes that often came out in American literature. The way Americans thought about Austen was represented in an argument between William Dean Howells and Mark Twain. Through his essays, Howells helped make Austen much more popular. Twain, however, used Austen to argue against the Anglophile tradition in America. In his book "Following the Equator", Twain described the library on his ship: "Jane Austen's absent from this library. Just that one omission alone would make a fairly good library out of a library that hadn't a book in it."

The "Encyclopædia Britannica's" changed the way they described Austen as she became more and more popular. The eighth edition (1854) called her "an elegant novelist". The ninth edition (1875) praised her as "one of the most distinguished (remarkable) modern British novelists". Austen novels began to be studied at universities. Her works also began to come out in histories of the English novel. Most people still thought of her as "dear aunt Jane", the way she was first presented in the "Memoir". Howells had made this picture of Austen famous by his essays in the "Harper's Magazine". Writer and critic Leslie Stephen described a mania for Austen that grew in the 1880s as "Austenolatry". It was only after the the "Memoir" was printed that readers grew to like Austen as a person. Until then, literary elites had said their enjoyment of Austen showed how clever they were. However, around the 1990s, they grew troubled at how popular Austen's works became. They began calling themselves "Janeites". They wanted to show that they were different from the people who they thought did not understand Austen properly.

American novelist Henry James liked Austen. Once he said she was as great as Shakespeare, Cervantes, and Henry Fielding—"the fine painters of life". But James thought Austen was an "unconscious" artist who was "instinctive and charming". In 1905, James said he did not like the public interest in Austen. He said it was more than Austen's "intrinsic merit (worth) and interest" deserved. James said that this was mostly because of the "stiff breeze of the special bookselling body of publishers, editors, illustrators, producers of the pleasant twaddle of magazines; who have found their 'dear,' our dear, everybody's dear, their material pretty reproduction in every variety of what is called tasteful, and in what seemingly proves to be salable, form."

Reginald Farrer, a British travel writer, did not like the sentimental image of "Aunt Jane". Instead, he wanted to study Austen's fiction in a new way. In 1917, he published a long essay in the "Quarterly Review". Jane Austen scholar A. Walton Litz called it the best single introduction to her works. Southam calls it as a "Janeite" piece without the worship. Farrer claimed that Jane Austen was not unconscious (disagreeing with James). He said that she was a writer of great concentration and a sharp critic of her society. He called her "radiant and remorseless", "dispassionate yet pitiless", with "the steely quality, the incurable rigor of her judgment". Farrer was one of the first critics who saw Austen as a writer.

The light of Austen scholarship was beginning to shine through several important early works. These works helped Austen become well accepted in the . The first was Oxford Shakespearean scholar Andrew Cecil Bradley's 1911 essay. This essay was "generally (largely) regarded (seen) as the starting-point for the serious academic approach to Jane Austen". Bradley pointed out Austen's ties to eighteenth-century critic and writer Samuel Johnson. He argued that she was a moralist as well as a humorist. According to Southam, this argument was "totally (completely) original". Bradley separated Austen's works into "early" and "late" novels. Scholars still separate Austen's works as Bradley did today. The second original early-twentieth-century critic of Austen was R. W. Chapman. His edition of Austen's works was the first scholarly edition of the works of any English novelist. The Chapman edition has been the basis for all editions of Austen's works after that.

After Bradley and Chapman, Austen scholarship grew very quickly in the 1920s. British writer E. M. Forster pointed out Austen's works for his idea of the "round" character. It was with the 1939 publication of Mary Lascelles' "Jane Austen and Her Art"—"the first full-scale historical and scholarly study" of Austen—that the academic study of her works matured. Lascelles included a short essay about her, a study of the books Austen read and their influence on her writing, and a study of Austen's style and "narrative art". Lascelles felt that critics before her had all worked in a way "so small that the reader does not see how they have reached their conclusions until he has patiently found his own way to them". She wished to study all of Austen's works, style, and techniques together. Critics after Lascelles agreed that she studied them well. Lascelles was interested in Austen's connection to Samuel Johnson and her desire to discuss morality through fiction. In this she was much like Bradley before her. But around this time, some fans of Austen began to worry that her works were being enjoyed by only a few people. They were fearful that Austen was being criticized only by academics. This was an argument that continued to the beginning of the twenty-first century.
Mid-century revisionist views started to become popular, and scholars began studying Austen more sceptically. D. W. Harding, adding to Farrer, wrote an essay called "Regulated Hatred: An Aspect of the Work of Jane Austen". He argued that Austen did not support society's customs, and that her irony was not funny but bitter. He also claimed that Austen wanted to show the faults of the society she wrote about. Through her use of irony, Austen tried to protect herself as an artist and a person from the behavior and practices she disliked. Almost at the same time, British critic Q. D. Leavis printed "Critical Theory of Jane Austen's Writing" in "Scrutiny" in the early 1940s. In there, Leavis argued that Austen was a professional, not an amateur (untrained), writer. Harding's and Leavis's articles were followed by "Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery" (1952). This was written by Martin Mudrick, who saw Austen as lonely, defensive, and critical of her society. He carefully described the connection between Austen's attitude towards the literature of her time and how she used irony to show the difference of how society was, and how she thought it could be. An important British critic, F. R. Leavis, said in "The Great Tradition" (1948) that Austen was one of the great writers of English fiction. Ian Watt agreed, and helped shape the arguments about the genre of the novel. The revisionist views and Leavis's words helped Austen to have a great reputation among academics. They agreed that she "combined (put together) <nowiki>[</nowiki>Henry Fielding's and Samuel Richardson's<nowiki>]</nowiki> qualities of interiority and irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to (better than) both".

After the Second World War, people began studying Austen more deeply, and in different ways. A great number of people have studied Austen as a political writer. Critic Gary Kelly explains, "Some see her as a political 'conservative' because she seems to defend the established social order. Others see her as sympathetic to 'radical' politics that challenged the established order, especially in the form of critics see Austen's novels , criticizing aspects of the social order but supporting and an open class hierarchy." In "Jane Austen and the War of Ideas" (1975), perhaps the most important of these works, Marilyn Butler argues that Austen was greatly influenced by the principal moral and political arguments of her time, and that she had a partisan, firmly conservative and Christian position in these arguments. Alistair M. Duckworth in "The Improvement of the Estate: A Study of Jane Austen's Novels" (1971) argues that Austen used the concept of the "estate" to symbolise all that was important society, which should be conserved (kept), improved, and passed down to future generations. As Rajeswari Rajan notes, "the idea of a political Austen is no longer seriously challenged". The questions scholars now study include: "the Revolution, war, nationalism, empire, class, 'improvement' [of the estate], the clergy, town versus (against) country, abolition, the professions, female emancipation; whether her politics were Tory, Whig, or radical; whether she was a conservative or a revolutionary, or occupied (kept) a reformist position between these extremes".

In the 1970s and 1980s, Austen studies was influenced by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar's "The Madwoman in the Attic" (1979). "The Madwoman in the Attic" explores the "explosive anger" of nineteenth-century female English writers under their "decorous (proper) surfaces". This work, together with other feminist criticism of Austen, has made people see her as a "woman" writer. The interest these critics showed in Austen made people discover and study other women writers in Austen's time. Also, when Julia Prewitt Brown's "Jane Austen's Novels: Social Change and Literary Form" (1979), Margaret Kirkham's "Jane Austen: Feminism and Fiction" (1983), and Claudia L. Johnson's "Jane Austen: Women, Politics and the Novel" (1988) were printed, scholars were no longer able to argue that Austen was firmly "apolitical, or '". Kirkham, for example, said that Austen's thought and that of Mary Wollstonecraft were quite similar. She called them both "Enlightenment feminists". Johnson also places Austen in an eighteenth-century political tradition. However, she notes the influence Austen received from the political novels of the 1790s written by women.

In the late-1980s, 1990s, and 2000s ideological, postcolonial, and Marxist criticism dominated Austen studies. Generating heated debate, Edward Said devoted a chapter of his book "Culture and Imperialism" (1993) to "Mansfield Park", arguing that the peripheral position of "Antigua" and the issue of slavery demonstrated that colonial oppression was an unspoken assumption of English society during the early nineteenth century. In "Jane Austen and the Body: 'The Picture of Health"', (1992) John Wiltshire explored the preoccupation with illness and health of Austen's characters. Wiltshire addressed current theories of "the body as sexuality", and more broadly how culture is "inscribed" on the representation of the body. There has also been a return to considerations of aesthetics with D. A. Miller's "Jane Austen, or The Secret of Style" (2003) which connects artistic concerns with queer theory.

Unclaimed territory, formally correct terra nullius, is a word from International law. It is used to talk about land which has never been under the rule of any state. It can also be that the previous owner has given up their ownership. This can be done either implicitly or explicitly. There is also the term No man's land, but it may have a slightly different meaning. Rule over "terra nullius" can be obtained by occupying the territory.

Two territories that are currently terra nullius are Bir Tawil between Egypt and Sudan, and Marie Byrd Land, in Antarctica.

The Free State (Afrikaans: Vrystaat, Sotho: Foreistata; before 1995, the Orange Free State) is a province of South Africa. Its capital is Bloemfontein, which is also South Africa's judicial capital. The current borders of the province date from 1994 when the Bantustans were destroyed and were put into the provinces of South Africa. It is also the only one of the older provinces of South Africa not to undergo border changes, not counting the incorporation of Bantustans.

Bir Tawil

Bir Tawil or Bi'r Tawīl (بيرطويل in Arabic; Bi'r or بير , meaning water well), is a small, , area. It is along the border between Egypt and Sudan. It is claimed by neither country right now. It is sometimes given the name the Land of the Vidya. The longer side is in the north of the area. It runs along the 22° north circle of latitude. 

The administrative boundary of Sudan and Egypt was made in 1902. Their political boundary was set in 1899. It was set as the 22° north circle of latitude. This area lies south of the 22° parallel. East-to-west, the area is between long in the south. It is long in the north. It is between and wide north-to-south. It is also in size. 

The Bir Tawil area came under Egyptian administration in 1902. This was because it was grazing land of the Ababda tribe based near Aswan, Egypt. At the same time, the Hala'ib Triangle north of latitude 22° north, and northeast of the area, came under Sudanese administration. This was because the tribes of this area were based in Sudan. The two "triangles" border at one point, a quadripoint.

In 1899, the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement for Sudan set the border between the territories at the 22nd parallel. At that time, the United Kingdom ruled the area. In 1902 the UK drew a separate "administrative boundary". Using this boundary, a triangle of land north of the parallel was placed under Sudanese administration. It was because its inhabitants were closer to Khartoum than Cairo, both geographically and culturally. The area was ruled by the British Governor in Khartoum.

Egypt claims the original border from 1899, the 22° north circle of latitude. This would place the Hala'ib Triangle within Egypt and the Bir Tawil area within Sudan. Sudan claims the administrative border of 1902. This would put Hala'ib within Sudan, and Bir Tawil within Egypt. As a result, both states claim the Hala'ib Triangle. Neither state claims the much less valuable Bir Tawil area, which is only a tenth the size and is landlocked. There is no basis in international law for Sudan or Egypt to claim both territories. It would also be difficult for any other state to claim the area. This is because only Sudan or Egypt border the land. As a result, Bir Tawil is one of the few land areas of the world which is not claimed by any state.

In the north of the area is the mountain Jabal Tawil (جبل طويل in Arabic, located at ). It has a height of 459 meters. In the east is Jabal Ḩajar az Zarqā'. It has a height of 662 meters.

In the south is the Wadi Tawil (وادي طويل in Arabic, also called "Khawr Abū Bard", located at ), near Nogaem Valley.

Siegbert Tarrasch

Siegbert Tarrasch (Breslau, now Wrocław, 5 March 1862 – Munich, 17 February 1934) was a doctor, and one of the strongest chess grandmasters of the day.

Tarrasch was born in Breslau, in Prussian Silesia. He left in 1880 to study medicine, and qualified as a physician. He lived most of his life in Nuremberg, Bavaria, and later in Munich. Tarrasch was born Jewish, and converted to Christianity in 1909. He was a patriotic German, who lost a son in World War I, but he faced antisemitism in the early stages of Nazism.
Tarrasch won more strong tournaments in the 1890s than any other player, and drew a 22-game match against Mikhail Chigorin, the leading Russian player. Tarrasch was also an influential chess writer, who summarised the chess ideas of the 1890s. It was his ideas against which the hypermoderns reacted in the early 1920s.<ref name="H/W">Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. "The Oxford companion to chess". 2nd ed, Oxford.</ref>

Occupied with his profession, Tarrasch did not challenge Steinitz, and turned down the young Emanuel Lasker's request for a match. This turned out to be a mistake, for Lasker then challended Steinitz, and won the world chess championship. Later Tarrasch unsuccessfully challenged Lasker for the world championship, in 1908. He was by then past his best, though he continued to play in tournaments for many years. His best result in later years was to reach the final pool in the strong St. Petersburg 1914 tournament. He came fourth, behind Lasker, Capablanca and Alekhine.

Tarrasch was a highly esteemed chess writer. His "Dreihundert Schachpartien" (1895; 300 chess games) was a landmark; it was the first game collection with in-depth annotations. In his later textbook "The game of chess" (1931) he wrote

Kwanzaa

Kwanzaa is a week long celebration held in the United States to honor universal African heritage and culture. People light a kinara (candle holder with seven candles) and give each other gifts. It takes place from December 26 to January 1 every year. It was created by Maulana Karenga and was first celebrated in 1966 - 1967. Non-African Americans also celebrate Kwanzaa. The holiday greeting is "Joyous Kwanzaa".

Kwanzaa is a celebration that started in the black nationalist movement of the 1960s. It was created as a way to help African Americans reconnect with their African cultural and historical heritage. 

The name Kwanzaa comes from the Swahili phrase "matunda ya kwanza", meaning first fruits of the harvest. 

During the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said that it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas, that Jesus was psychotic, and that Christianity was a white religion that black people should shun. However, as Kwanzaa became more popular, Karenga changed his position so that practicing Christians could also feel included. He stated in the 1997 "Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community, and Culture", "Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday."

Many Christian African Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa do so in addition to observing Christmas.

Kwanzaa celebrates what its founder called the seven principles of Kwanzaa, or "Nguzo Saba" (originally "Nguzu Saba"—the seven principles of blackness). Karenga said that this "is a communitarian African philosophy," . It consists of what Karenga called "the best of African thought and practice in constant exchange with the world." These seven principles comprise "Kawaida", a Swahili term for tradition and reason. Each of the seven days of Kwanzaa is dedicated to one of the following principles, as follows:


Kwanzaa symbols include a decorative mat on which other symbols are placed, corn and other crops, a candle holder with seven candles, called a kinara, a communal cup for pouring libations, gifts, a poster of the seven principles, and a black, red, and green flag. The symbols were designed to convey the seven principles.

During Kwanzaa, families also decorate their households with objects of art. They use colorful African cloth such as kente, especially the wearing of kaftans by women. Fresh fruits that represent African idealism are also used. It is normal to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors. Libations are shared, generally with a common chalice ("a shared cup"), "Kikombe cha Umoja", passed around to all people present. A Kwanzaa ceremony may include drumming and musical selections, libations, a reading of the African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness, reflection on the Pan-African colors, a discussion of the African principle of the day or a chapter in African history, a candle-lighting ritual, artistic performance, and, finally, a feast (Karamu). The greeting for each day of Kwanzaa is "Habari Gani?" which is Swahili for "What's the News?"

Cultural exhibitions include the Spirit of Kwanzaa, an annual celebration held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts featuring interpretive dance, African dance, song and poetry.

Interventional radiology is defined as the branch of medicine that diagnoses and treats a wide range of diseases using actions that are performed through the skin (for example an injection) or carried out with the least damage by x-rays, sonography, and so on.

Some of these procedures are done only for diagnostic purposes, while others are done for treatment purposes. Images are used to direct these procedures, which are usually done with needles or other tiny instruments like small tubes called catheters. The images provide road maps that allow the Interventional Radiologist to guide these instruments through the body to the areas containing diseases.

Chess Olympiad

Chess Olympiads are chess events open to all national teams. They have been run since 1927 by the world chess organisation, FIDE. Since 1950, they have been run every two years. Earlier events were all-play-all. Then, as numbers grew, a system of qualifying sections were used. In recent times, the format has been a Swiss system. This, in chess terms, is a method whereby opponents are chosen each round to have similar scores. It has been widely used for individual tournaments. 

Chess is a recognized sport by the International Olympic Committee with FIDE being the recognized International Sports Federation for chess since June 1999.
As a member of the International Olympic Committee, FIDE adheres to its rules, including controversially having doping tests. The prospects of chess becoming an Olympic sporting event at some future date remain unclear. The naming of FIDE's team championship as the "Chess Olympiad" is of historical origin and implies no connection between this event and the Olympic Games.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> In 1936 FIDE refused its approval on grounds of Nazi anti-semitism; however, the organisers accepted Jewish players, and many did play in the event.

Cassandra Austen

Cassandra Elizabeth Austen (9 January 1773 – 22 March 1845) was the older sister of Jane Austen. She was Jane's best friend and a beauty. Her fiance died; she never married.

Austen was born in 1773 in Steventon, Hampshire. Her father was the Rev. George Austen (1731–1805), and her mother was Cassandra, "née" Leigh (1739–1827). There were 8 Austen children. As Cassandra and Jane were the only girls they kept up an especially close friendship through their entire lives. Over 100 letters addressed to Cassandra from Jane are still kept. These letters have helped historians to find out more details about the life of Jane Austen. When Cassandra went to school, Jane followed her. At first it was arranged that Jane was not to go, as she was considered to be too young for schooling. However, she ended up going with Cassandra. In their mother's words, "if Cassandra's head had been going to be cut off, Jane would have hers cut off too".

When Jane died in 1817, Austen is reported to have destroyed many of her letters, most of them dated after 1795. Austen herself lived alone until her death on 22 March 1845, aged 72. She was buried at St. Nicholas' Church in Chawton, Hampshire.

"Pokémon Black" and "White" are role-playing games where the player captures creatures called Pokémon. They can use them to battle against other Pokémon. One of the new features in the games are triple battles, which allows players to battle three Pokémon against three Pokémon. Also new is that the seasons change, and areas in the game have falling leaves in the fall, and snow in the winter.

"Pokémon Black" and "White" take place in the Unova region, which is based on New York City and its surrounding area, unlike past games being based on regions of Japan. The plot of the game follows a new Pokémon trainer who is on a journey to become a Pokémon master. They do this by battling other trainers such as Gym Leaders, and finally the Elite Four. During this journey, the player meets an evil team known as Team Plasma, who look like knights. Team Plasma wants to make a new world where Pokémon are away from humans.

Adolf Anderssen

Karl Ernst Adolf Anderssen (Breslau, 6 July 1818 – Breslau, 13 March 1879) was a German chess master, and a teacher of mathematics. He was recognised as the best player in the world for much of the time between 1851 to 1870. He won three great international tournaments: the first in London 1851, then London 1862 and Baden-Baden 1870. Anderssen was somewhat less good in matches, and lost in 1858 to Paul Morphy and, narrowly, to Steinitz in 1866. He was also a chess problem composer.

Anderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered—including the Baden-Baden 1870 tournament, which is comparable to modern strong GM tournaments. His last success was at Leipzig in 1877 where he came second equal with Zukertort, behind Paulsen. He was then nearly 60.

He is still famous for his brilliant sacrificial attacking play, particularly in the 'Immortal Game' (1851) and the 'Evergreen Game' (1852). He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an elder statesman of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration.

Bayesian network

A Bayesian network is a kind of graph which is used to model events that cannot be observed. This can then be used for inference. The graph that is used is directed, and does not contain any cycles. The nodes of the graph represent random variables. If two nodes are connected by an edge, it has an associated probability that it will transmit from one node to the other.

Bayesian networks are mainly used in the field of (unassisted) machine learning. They have been used where information needs to be classified. Examples are image, document, or speech recognition, and information retrieval.

It is based on Reverend Thomas Bayes' discovery in the 1740's called Bayes' theorem.
The term "Bayesian networks" was made by Judea Pearl in 1985 to emphasize three aspects:

In the late 1980's the seminal texts "Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems" and "Probabilistic Reasoning in Expert Systems" summarized the properties of Bayesian networks and helped to establish Bayesian networks as a field of study. 

Informal variants of such networks were first used by legal scholar John Henry Wigmore, in the form of Wigmore charts, to analyse trial evidence in 1913. Another variant, called path diagrams, was developed by the geneticist Sewall Wright and used in social and behavioral sciences (mostly with linear parametric models).

The M1 Abrams is a modern main battle tank in United States service as well as exported to several countries. It is a well armed, well protected, and fast tank designed for modern armored ground warfare. Notable features of the M1 Abrams include the use of a powerful engine, layered armor, and a low profile. It is one of the heaviest tanks in service, weighing almost 70 short tons.

The M1 Abrams entered U.S. service in 1980, replacing the M60 Patton. Three main versions of the M1 Abrams have been deployed, the M1, M1A1, and M1A2, incorporating improved armament, protection and electronics. These improvements, as well as periodic upgrades to older tanks have allowed this long-serving vehicle to remain in front-line service. The M1A3 is currently under development. It is the principal main battle tank of the United States Army and Marine Corps, and the armies of Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Australia, and in 2010 Iraq. The M1 Abrams is anticipated to be in U.S. service until the 2050s, approximately 70 years after entering U.S. service.

<doc id="237113" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=237113" title="Sexual intercourse">
Sexual intercourse

Animals that reproduce sexually use sexual intercourse to have offspring. Sometimes sexual intercourse is called coitus or copulation and is more casually known as having sex or sleeping together. In sexual intercourse, the male reproductive organ enters the female reproductive tract. The two animals may be of opposite sexes or they may be hermaphroditic, as is the case with snails.

Sexual intercourse between animals other than humans is often called mating. Most animals only mate when the female is at the point of estrus, which is the most fertile period of time in its reproductive cycle. 

In certain animals, sexual intercourse is not only used for reproduction, but has taken other functions as well. These animals include bonobos, dolphins, and chimpanzees which also have sexual intercourse even when the female is not in estrus, and to engage in sex acts with same-sex partners. In most instances, humans have sex primarily for pleasure. This behavior in the above mentioned animals is also presumed to be for pleasure, which in turn strengthens social bonds.

Humans sometimes engage in behaviours that do not include the penetration of sexual organs, such as oral intercourse or anal intercourse or by non-sexual organs (fingering, fisting). These behaviours are sometimes included in the definition of "sexual intercourse". 

Sexual intercourse with a partner of the same sex is called homosexual sex.

Forcing someone to have sex who does not want to, called rape, is a serious crime in many countries.

Sexual intercourse is the natural and most common way to make a baby. It involves a man and woman having sex without birth control until the man ejaculates, or releases, semen from his penis into the woman's vagina. The semen, containing sperm (which is made in his testicles), moves to the Fallopian tubes, and if it finds an ovum on its way, it will try to fertilize it. If this works, the now fertilized ovum sticks to the side of the uterus and the woman becomes pregnant. The fertilized ovum then develops into a human. Medically, it is called a pregnancy until birth.

Certain species of animals also have sex for other purposes than to bear offspring. These include Humans, bonobos, chimpanzees and dolphins. These species also are among those known to engage in homosexual behaviors.
In both humans and bonobos, the female has a relatively concealed ovulation. Neither male or female partners commonly know whether she is fertile at any given moment. One reason for this may be that sex partners of these species form strong emotional bonds. The partners come together for more than just sexual intercourse. In the case of humans, long-term partnership is more important than immediate sexual reproduction.

Humans, bonobos and dolphins show cooperative behaviour. In many cases, this behaviour has shown better results than what an individual can achieve alone. In these animals, the use of sex has evolved beyond reproduction and has taken additional social functions. Sex reinforces intimate social bonds between individuals. Overall, such cooperation also benefits each member of the group in that they are better able to survive.

In humans, sexual intercourse seems to serve three types of purposes,which do not exclude one another:

In the late 20th century, very effective forms of contraception (birth control) were developed allowing a man and women to help prevent a baby from being made. One type of contraception is a condom. This is a piece of rubber that covers the penis that a man can wear during intercourse, which stops the man's semen from going into the woman's vagina. This does not always work though because the condom will rip or tear. Another well-known type of contraception is called the Pill, which a woman takes every day. When a woman is "on the Pill," she and her partner may have sex any time they wish with very little chance of making a baby. Contraception allows people to keep "sex for fun" separate from "sex to make children". For example, a fertile couple may use contraception to experience sexual pleasure (recreational). At the same time, this experience may strengthen their relationship, and a stronger relationship may mean that they will better be able to raise children in the future.

Who people like to have sex with depends on their sexuality. Men who like to have sex with women, and women who like to have sex with men are heterosexual or "straight". Men who only like to have sex with other men, and women who only like to have sex with other women are homosexual or "gay". A different word to describe a woman who only likes to have sex with other women is "lesbian". Some people likes both men and women, which is called being bisexual. Some people have fetishes in which they pleasure themselves sexually.

Some diseases can be caught by having sex. These diseases are called sexually-transmitted infections (STIs).

Some examples of STIs include chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhoea. A virus called HIV causes AIDS, which cannot be cured and can lead to death.

Using Latex condoms or oral dams reduce the chance that a few types of diseases will be passed on, but it not entirely effective for all STIs. Birth control (like "the Pill") can prevent pregnancy, but won't prevent sexual infections.

Some STIs can also be spread in ways other than having sex. For example, herpes simplex and hepatitis B could be caught by a virgin without having sex, but can also be caught through sex. Some types of STIs can spread from contact between the genitals, mouth, anus, skin, eyes, and (rarely) infected surfaces; this depends a lot on the type of STI and how it spreads. Some common diseases like HPV can cause warts and cancer in the genitals or anus or throat.

There exists an HPV vaccine that prevents some sexually-transmitted strains of HPV; however, the vaccine only works if you get vaccinated before becoming infected. The vaccine is approved of for both men and women, but is often not required in the U.S. due to politics.

There are many other kinds of sex. Two of them are oral sex and anal sex.

Oral sex is when one partner uses the tongue, mouth, or throat to excite the other partner's sex organs.

Slang for oral sex is common in Western cultures, for example: "going down on", "giving a blowjob", or "giving head". The technical term for oral sex is fellatio if performed on a male and cunnilingus if performed on a female. When a man performs fellatio on himself, it is called autofellatio.

People can get sexually transmitted infections from oral sex, such as herpes (which can be passed between the mouth and groin),HIV and even oral cancer.

Anal sex is when an erect penis or other device made for sexual pleasure is inserted into the sexual partner's anus. Anal sex with a female does not lead to pregnancy by itself, however, semen can leak out of the anus and enter into the vagina, and pregnancy may rarely occur. Anal sex can still pass sexually transmitted diseases from one partner to another. It can also be very unhealthy for the body because the skin around the anus can tear, bleed and get infected with bacteria. For safety and pleasure partners often use a condoms, female condoms and/or lubrication.

A painful sexual act is a condition of repeated or persistent genital pain before, during, or after sexual intercourse due to physical, psychogenic and emotional causes. Doctors call the condition as "dyspareunia". It occurs in women and men. The condition affects up to one-fifth of women at some point in their lives.

Gerontology

Gerontology (from Greek: γέρων, "geron", "old man" and -λογία, "-logy", "study of") is the study of the social, psychological and biological aspects of aging. It is distinguished from "geriatrics", which is the branch of medicine that studies the disease of the elderly. 

Gerontology includes these and other endeavors:

"Biogerontology" is the subfield of gerontology dedicated to studying the biological processes of aging. It includes "Biomedical gerontology," also known as "experimental gerontology" and "life extension", is a sub discipline of biogerontology that endeavors to slow, prevent, and even reverse aging in both humans and animals. Curing age-related diseases is one approach, and slowing down the underlying processes of aging with the help of physical exercises is another. Most "life extensionists" believe the human life span can be altered within the 21st century.

"Social gerontology" is a multi-disciplinary sub-field that specializes in studying or working with older adults. Social gerontologists may have degrees or training in social work, nursing, psychology, sociology, demography, gerontology, or other social science disciplines. Social gerontologists are responsible for educating, researching, and advancing the broader causes of older people by giving informative presentations, publishing books and articles that pertain to the aging population, producing relevant films and television programs, and producing new graduates of these various disciplines in college and university settings.

Emperor Kimmei's father was Emperor Keitai and his mother was Emperor Ninken's daughter, . He was the third son; and his older brother was Emperor Senka.

Kimmei had six wives and 25 Imperial children (16 sons and 9 daughters).

Complex sentence

Complex sentence are sentence with two or more of dependent sentences and independent sentences mixed together by subordinating conjunctions,such as "Although, after, until, while, when" and so forth.
For example:
"Before the curtain rose, Nick came out and took a took a bow,"

In this sentence, "before" is a subordinating conjunction. "before the curtain rose" is a dependent sentence. With its subordinating conjunction, it joins the independent sentence by being smootly contacted by its meaning. But without this independent sentence,"Nick came and took a bow", the dependent sentence cannot stay by it self. "Before the curtain rose" cannot stay by it self without an independent sentence joined togther.

Emperor Keitai

, also known as "Keitai okimi", was the 26th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Keitai to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Keitai"-tennō" was created for him posthumously by later generations. 

No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.

Some modern reference works of history call Keitai the "King Ohoto of Koshi". Koshi was a small regional entity in what would become Koshi Province in northern Japan.

According to the "Kojiki" and "Nihon Shoki", Ketai was a fifth generation grandson of Emperor Ōjin. 

When Emperor Buretsu died without a successor, Ketai attained the throne. 

There was a period of disputes over the succession after Keitai's death. One branch of the Yamato clan supported sons who would become Emperor Ankan and Emperor Senka. Another branch supported the third son who would become known as Emperor Kimmei.

Very little is known about the events of Keitai's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei. 

Keitai confronted rebellion in Kyūshū, which was then known as the . The emperor sent forces to calm the unrest.

It is not known how long Keitai lived after his abdication. Keitai abdicated in his favor of his eldest son who would become known as Ankan. Ankan died four years later, and Keitai's next oldest son would attain the throne. This son would come to be known as Emperor Senka.

Senka died after three years as emperor; and the throne would be vacant. The third son of Ketai would attained the throne, and he would become known as Emperor Kemmei. 

This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Keitai. 

According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun"). Keitai is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") which is associated with the burial mound.

Paul Morphy

Paul Morphy (22 June 1837 – 10 July 1884), called "the pride and sorrow of chess", was an American chess master. He was the greatest chess player of his era and an unofficial world champion. This was widely accepted when he defeated Adolf Anderssen, by 7 wins to 2 with 2 draws, in 1858. Morphy was also one of the first great chess prodigies in the modern era.<ref name="H/W">Hooper, David and Whyld, Kenneth 1992. "The Oxford companion to chess". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-866164-9</ref>

Morphy was a Creole of mixed inheritance. He was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, to a father of Portuguese, Irish, and Spanish ancestry, and a mother who was a French Creole. His father was a lawyer, and his mother was musically talented. Morphy grew up in an atmosphere of culture where chess and music were the typical highlights of a Sunday home gathering.

Morphy taught himself, and by nine he was good by the standards of the local players. At 12 he defeated the Hungarian professional Löwenthal in three casual games. Then he played little chess until he had qualified in law in April 1857. He then entered the first American Chess Congress in New York, and won it decisively. Next, he accepted an invitation to play in a tournament in Birmingham, England. That started his famous European tour. He beat everyone of note in England, though Staunton avoided a match.

In Paris he beat Harrwitz, the house professional, at the Café de la Régence. He then won easily against Anderssen, who was a bit out of practice. One of his feats was to play simultaneously against five masters, winning two, drawing two and losing one. In summary, he proved he was the best at that time. On his return home he toured the East Coast cities, accepting testimonials, banquets and applause. He wrote a chess column for a year in the New York Ledger in 1859–60. For this he was paid $3000, but he was lazy, and the work ended.

Quick and simple development leading to a direct attack: that was Morphy's method. His openings were first-rate for their time. He brought off some outstanding combinations and sacrifices, and his best games are still a model for young players. His games mark the high point of the romantic movement in chess, where players would play all out for direct attacks. This style was later squashed by better defensive technique, especially for the black side in the openings. Out of this came Dr Tarrasch's classical principles, and the idea that no game can be lost without a mistake being made. The chess of the 1890s came to look quite different from Morphy's games, partly because he had forced players to think more clearly about what they were doing.

Morphy soon gave up chess, but his law practice was disrupted by the American Civil War (1861–1865). He was opposed to secession, and did not serve in the Confederate Army. Morphy traveled to Havana and to Paris, where he had a married sister, but refused invitations to play in public. His law practice never took off, and he never worked or played chess again. The last years of his life were marred by mental illness bordering on paranoia. He suffered from distrust, obsessions and delusions, and showed erratic behavior.

Morphy died at 47, in his bathtub, perhaps of a stroke. He was the first of several great American players to have a short chess career. Pillsbury died young, reputedly of syphilis, and Bobby Fischer, like Morphy, stopped voluntarily, while still a young man. Fischer showed symptoms of mental illness of a similar kind to Morphy's.

Emperor Bidatsu

The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.

He was the second son of Emperor Kimmei by his consort Iwahime, who was a daughter of Emperor Senka.

Though he had many children, none of them would ever become emperor.

According to the "Nihonshoki" and "Gukanshō", Bidatsu had four empresses and 16 Imperial children (6 sons and 10 daughters).



Bidatsu's reign was marked by power struggles about the introduction of Buddhism in Japan. The emperor's first minister was Soga no Umako. His role grew in importance. 

Bidatsu suffered from an unknown disease which afflicted him with sores. Probably, he was the first royal victim of smallpox in Japan.

In the 14th year of Bidatsu's reign, he died; and the succession ("senso") were passed to his younger half-brother who became known as Emperor Yōmei. 
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Bidatsu. 

According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun"). Bidatsu is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") which is associated with the burial mound.

Café de la Régence

The Café de la Régence was for well over a century the most famous meeting-place for chess players. It was a spacious coffee-house in the centre of Paris, founded in 1688, and named in 1718. It was originally under the patronage of the Duc d'Orleans, and attracted a literary crowd. 

Chess players moved there en masse around 1740. The clientele included amateurs, such as Voltaire, Rousseau, Robespierre, Benjamin Franklin and Napoleon. The leading professionals, Deschapelles, La Bourdonnais, Verdoni, Philidor, were there on a daily basis, when in Paris. Staunton played his match against Saint-Amant there; Paul Morphy played there in the 1858, including his match with Anderssen. The café was relocated in 1855, and the chess room was finally closed in 1916.

Longevity

The word "longevity" is sometimes used as a synonym for "life expectancy" or to connote "long life", especially when it concerns someone or something lasting longer than expected.

Longevity usually includes thinking about methods to extend life. Longevity has been a topic not only for the scientific community but also for writers of science fiction and utopian novels.

Longevity stories are cultural traditions and lore about exceptional human longevity, with or without "eternal youth". These stories include sincere beliefs of claims of extreme age. Each category of belief is based on a different motivation for claiming exceptional age.

Stories of exaggerated longevity have been around since the earliest civilizations. The first longevity narratives were probably the patriarchal/matriarchal claims, which are often an attempt to link humans to the gods or to God due to fuller life. In some religious traditions there are claims that, if one follows a certain philosophy or practice, one can become immortal or at least live to an extreme age.

Fountain of Youth narratives describe some natural source that provides healing and particularly longevity and youthful health. An extension and adaptation of the fountain of youth concept is the idea that a particular place, rather than a substance, carries what is needed to attain extreme age, and that a person seeking extreme longevity needs to move to a special district.

The U.S. Census Bureau predicts that life expectancy in the United States will be in the mid-80s by 2050 (up from 77.85 in 2006) and will top out eventually in the low 90s, barring major scientific advances that can change the rate of human aging itself, as opposed to merely treating the effects of aging as is done today. The Census Bureau also predicted that the United States would have 5.3 million people aged over 100 in 2100. The United Nations has also made projections far out into the future, up to 2300, at which point it projects that life expectancies in most developed countries will be between 100 and 106 years and still rising, though more and more slowly than before. However, the UN has warned that these projections are uncertain, and caution that any change or advancement in medical technology could invalidate their projections .

Judit Polgár

Judit Polgár (born 23 July 1976) is a Hungarian chess grandmaster. She is by far the strongest female chess player in history, yet she has never played in the Women's World Chess Championship. In 1991 she got the title of Grandmaster (GM) at 15 years, 4 months. She was, at that time, the youngest person to do so. Polgár is now ranked number 51 in the world, the only woman on FIDE's "Top 100 Players" list; she has been ranked as high as eighth.

Judit and her two sisters were educated at home by their father. She always preferred playing in the open events, making it clear from the start that she wanted to become the true world chess champion regardless of gender. This considerably annoyed the Hungarian Chess Federation, which had visions of winning the Women's World Championship after decades of Soviet domination. Paid substantial appearance fees by the Hungarian Chess Federation, the family did play in two female-only events. The Hungarians (nicknamed 'Polgaria') won the Women's Chess Olympiads, with a team packed with Polgárs, in 1988 and 1990. Zsuzsa, Judit, Sofia (the least strong sister) and Ildiko Madl were the team which pushed the Soviet Union into second place for the first time. 

In 1994 Judit suffered a controversial defeat at the hands of then-world champion Garry Kasparov, the highest-rated chessplayer of all time. Kasparov changed his mind after making a losing move and then made another move instead. According to chess rules, once a player has released a piece s/he cannot make a different move, so Kasparov should have been made to play his original move. However, Polgár did not challenge this because she says there were no witnesses and an arbiter was not around. She was also unaware at the time that the re-move was caught on tape by a television crew. The tournament director was criticised for not forfeiting Kasparov when the videotape evidence was made available to him.

In the event, Polgar has not reached the top of the game (very few do), and now is the mother of two children. Nevertheless, she has broken the gender barrier in chess: she has proved that a woman can reach the top ten. Her sister, Susan Polgar, who now lives in the U.S.A., did become Women's World Champion, and also a full Grandmaster.

Ogyū Sorai

Sorai rejected the moral ways of Song Confucianism and looked at the older works instead. He argued that allowing human emotions to express themselves was important. For this reason, he tried to strengthen the position that Chinese literature had in Japan. Sorai had a large following with his teachings and created the Sorai school, which would become an influential force in Japanese Confucian scholarship.

Sorai was born the second son of a samurai (a warrior) who served as the personal physician of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi (徳川綱吉). Tsunayoshi would become the fifth shogun. Sorai studied the Zhu Xi version of Song Confucianism, and by 1690 he became a private teacher of Chinese classics. In 1696, he started serving Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu, a senior councilor to Tsunayoshi. Tsunayoshi died in 1709. At that time Sorai stopped using the teachings of Zhu Xi and started to develop his own philosophy and school. Sorai is credited with the creation of kō shōgi, an unusual form of chess.

Sorai wrote many influential works where he showed what he thought were the two basic problems of the philosophy of Song Confucianism. The first was with the bakufu-domain system, which by the eighteenth century was in trouble. Sorai doubted that it was enough that each person wanted to find their ethical good. He argued that solving the political crisis of the time required more than perfecting moral character. He also saw that the Chinese sage kings were not only concerned with morality, but also with government itself. The second point where Sorai disagreed with Song Confucianism was that he felt it was putting too much emphasis on morality and that it repressed human nature, because human nature was based on emotion. 

He felt that these weaknesses were not weaknesses of Confucianism; in his view, Song Confucianists interpreted the classic works of the Four Books and the Five Classics the wrong way. In Soraiu's view, they did this because they "did not know the old words". Sorai consulted the ancient works to get more reliable knowledge. He stated that the ultimate form of scholarly knowledge was history. For him, these works were the best source, even though the present was constantly changing. Sorai thought that study of philosophy began with the study of language. In this he was highly influenced by the Ancient Rhetoric school of the Ming period. This movement saw the Qin and Han periods as the model for prose, and the Tang period as a model for poetry. The Sorai school introduced in "Selections of Tang Poetry" to Japan, where it became very popular. This work is thought to have been edited by Li Panlong (李攀竜 1514-70), who was a founder of the Ancient Rhetoric school. As a result of this, Sorai's school is also known as the Ancient Rhetoric ("kobunji" 古文辞) school today. Sorai's school saw "Selections of Tang Poetry" mainly as a means of accessing the Five Classics. In this viewpoint it was different from other Confucianist schools. Sorai would also accuse other Confucianists in Japan, such as Hayashi Razan, of relying too heavily on Song sources such as Zhu Xi.

Sorai also did not agree with other teachings of Song Confucianism. One was that the "Way" was not a predetermined principle of the universe, but rather an establishment of men: the ancient sages had described it in the Confucianist classic works. These provided for the "Way", which was divided by rites ("rei" 礼) and music ("gaku" 楽). The rites gave social order and music gave inspiration for the heart. In this it directly allowed for the flow of human emotions, something that the moralist philosophy of Song Confucianism did not agree with. Sorai argued for the opposite, and wanted people to be enriched through music and poetry. He taught that literature should be cared for, because it was an important part of human expression. As a result, Chinese writing began to thrive in Japan and became an accepted art form. In this way, several great writers of Chinese composition of that time were followers of his school.

Sorai was a supporter of the samurai class. While most old institution decline because of leadership problems, the samurai, he felt, were best able to solve this problem with a system of rewards and punishment. Sorai also saw problems with the merchant class at the time: he accused them of conspiring to lock prices. He did not support the lower classes either, though. He argued, "What possible value can there be for the common people to overreach their proper station in life and study such books [as the Confucian classics]?"

"Master Sorai's Teachings" is a record of Sorai's teaching and his exchanges with his students. The text was edited by his own students and contained their questions followed by his answers. The work was not released until 1724, but it is thought to have actually been written around 1720. In it he writes that literature is not so much intended for instruction in morality or governance, rather it simply allows human's emotions to flow. From this, answers to the former topics may be found. While Sorai sought to redefine the sources of Tokugawa legitimacy, his purpose was clearly to strengthen the authority of the Tokugawa shogunate.

Some scholars criticised Sorai's work and found his teaching was impractical. Goi Ranshū believed that Sorai was motivated to surpass Itō Jinsai, another leading Confucianist. Goi thought that Sorai had used Itō's arguments to the level of absurdity. Goi felt that Sorai's teachings would cause a lot of damage to moral philosophy if they were followed. Another scholar critical of Sorai's teachings was Nakai Chikuzan, who was also familiar with Goi's opposition to Ogyū Sorai. Goi wrote his opposition to Sorai in his essay "Hi-Butsu hen". This essay was written in the 1730s, but not published until 1766. The published essay had been edited by Chikuzan and his brother. Nakai later wrote his own, highly emotional, response to Sorai's beliefs in his work "Hi-Chō" (1785). In this work he rejected the idea that individuals could not improve themselves through moral choices. He also claimed individuals were able judge if external ideas and actions were true or just. Denial of these morals, he felt, would leave only "rites and rules" to be followed.

Mercantilism

Mercantilism is the name given to a number of economic systems that were present in most parts of Europe between the 16th and the 18th century. The term was first used by Marquis de Mirabeau in 1763. Adam Smith made it known to a wider audience in 1766. At that time, absolutism was the main form of government in Europe. These regimes needed money to finance a large military, as well as many people that worked in the government. The monarchs and princes also needed money in order to finance their lifestyle. These governments were also very nationalistic. For this reason, mercantilism is seen as a form of economic nationalism, that holds that the prosperity of a nation is dependent upon its supply of capital, and that the global volume of international trade is "unchangeable". Economic assets (or capital) are represented by bullion (gold, silver, and trade value) held by the state, which is best increased through a positive balance of trade with other nations (exports minus imports).

The theory assumes that wealth and monetary assets are identical. Mercantilism suggests that the ruling government should advance these goals by playing a protectionist role in the economy by encouraging exports and discouraging imports, notably through the use of tariffs and subsidies. The theory dominated Western European economic policies from the 16th to the late-18th century.

Maimonides was born in Cordoba in Spain, in 1135. His Hebrew name was Moses ben Maimon. He is also known as the Rambam, from the intial letters of his title and name, Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon.

Maimonides was a doctor by profession. Maimonides was one of the most important Jewish philosophers of the Middle Ages. He tried to show that the philosophy of the ancient Greek thinker, Aristotle, and Judaism supported each other.

Maimonides' main philosophical work was called "The Guide for the Perplexed". He wrote it in Arabic by 1190. It has ideas from Aristotle's writings. "The Guide" influenced Christian Aristotelian theologians, for example, Thomas Aquinas. In 1168, Maimonides finished a commentary to the Mishnah, the written version of traditional Jewish oral law. Maimonides completed these books, called "Mishneh Torah", in about 1178. They one of the most important collections of Jewish laws. 

When Maimonides was thirteen years old, the Almohads took over Cordoba. The Almohads were Muslims who were taking over parts of Europe at the time. They forced all non-Muslims to leave, change their religion to Islam, or be killed. This forced Maimonides' family to leave Cordoba. They spent twelve years traveling and looking for a home. During these years, he wrote the commentary on the Mishnah. Finally, his family settled in Cairo, Egypt. In 1166, Maimonides' father died and his brother drowned on a shipwreck in the Indian Ocean. 

By this time, Maimonides was a very popular Jewish leader. He helped the Jewish community in Cairo, Egypt. He lived there for the last part of his life, and taught and wrote about Judaism. He died in Cairo on December 13, 1204.

The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.

Emperor Yōmei was the fourth son of Emperor Kimmei and his mother was Soga no Kitashihime, a daughter of Soga no Iname. 

Yōmei had three Empresses and seven Imperial sons and daughters.

Yōmei's son, Prince Umayado, is also known as Prince Shōtoku.




This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Yōmei. 

According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun"). Yōmei is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") which is associated with the burial mound.

Francis Crick

Francis Harry Compton Crick OM FRS (8 June 1916 – 28 July 2004) was a British physicist and biologist.

He is one of those who worked out the structure of DNA. Using X-ray crystallography results from Maurice Wilkins' biophysics team at King's College London, Crick and James Watson discovered that DNA has what is called a "double helix structure". 

This means that there are two spirals in DNA that have information. DNA is the basis of heredity for almost all forms of life today.

Crick, Watson and Wilkins won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1962. Their work sparked a huge amount of research in molecular and cell biology and, as a result, many subsequent Nobel awards have been made.

During the mid-to-late 1950s Crick helped sort out the way proteins are synthesized. In 1958, Crick's listed all the key features of the protein synthesis process:

The adaptor molecules were eventually shown to be tRNAs and the catalytic "ribonucleic-protein complexes" became known as ribosomes. An important step was later realization (in 1960) that the messenger RNA was not the same as the ribosomal RNA. 

The next fundamental question was the exact nature of the genetic code. In his 1958 article, Crick speculated, as had others, that a triplet of nucleotides could code for an amino acid. Crick also used the term "central dogma" to summarize an idea that implies that genetic information flow between macromolecules would be essentially one-way:

In his thinking about the processes linking DNA genes to proteins, Crick made clear the distinction between the materials involved, the energy required, and the information flow. Crick was focused on this third component (information) and it became the organizing principle of what became known as molecular biology. 

In the final phase of his career, Crick and Christof Koch published a series of articles on consciousness (1990–2005).

Crick decided to focus his work on how the brain generates visual awareness within a few hundred milliseconds of viewing a scene. Crick's book "The Astonishing Hypothesis" made the argument that neuroscience now had the tools required to begin a scientific study of how brains produce conscious experiences.

The Francis Crick Institute is a planned £660,000,000 biomedical research centre to be located in London. The Francis Crick Institute is a partnership between Cancer Research UK, Imperial College London, King's College London, the Medical Research Council, University College London (UCL) and the Wellcome Trust. Once completed in 2015, it will be the biggest centre for biomedical research and innovation in Europe.

Motion blindness

Motion blindness (also called Akinetopsia) is a medical condition where a person cannot see objects that are moving even though they can see the objects that do not move. The condition seems to be very rare, and related to the nerves. It may also be psychological. There is currently no treatment for this condition. A lot of information about this condition comes from different case studies done between 1913 and 2003. Most of what is known is from a single patient, called LM. LM was a 43 year old woman who was treated in a hospital in 1978, after she had suffered a stroke. 

Currently, motion blindness is thought to be caused by a change to the regions of the brain that are responsible for sight. This change is usually a result of damage done to the brain, and affects the way the brain "decodes" visual information. It is possible that only "visual" motion processing is affected because this is done in a separate area of the brain, which is different from the area that does motion processing in general. The same can happen to the perception of color, that is the patient can have a form of color blindness, which is known as achromatopsia. Unlike most other forms of color blindness, which are caused by changes in the eye, this one is caused by changes in the brain. 

People who suffer from motion blindness have "normal vision": They can see different objects sharply, can tell the distance between them (that one is "farther away" than the other) and they see the different colors the objects might have. This applies to shapes, objects and faces. They do, however, not see the objects move. Besides simple perception, akinetopsia also disturbs motoric tasks which rely on visual perception, such as reaching for objects and catching objects. When doing tasks, feedback of one's own motion appears to be important.

Patients with akinetopsia have problems with many tasks in their daily life. One patient, LM, described pouring a cup of tea or coffee difficult "because the fluid appeared to be frozen, like a glacier". She did not know when to stop pouring, because she could not perceive the movement of the fluid rising. LM and other patients have also complained of having trouble following conversations, because lip movements and changing facial expressions were missed. LM stated she felt insecure when more than two people were walking around in a room: "people were suddenly here or there but I have not seen them moving". LM and others have described crossing the street and driving cars to also be of great difficulty.

Currently, three conditions are known that cause motion blindness:

Emperor Sushun

The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty. 

Before he became the monarch, this prince's personal name ("imina") was Hatsusebe"-shinnō", also known as Hatsusebe no Waka-sazaki. His name at birth was Hatsusebe no Miko (長谷部皇子).

Sushun was the twelfth son of Emperor Kimmei. His mother was , a daughter of Soga no Iname, who was the chief of the Soga clan.

Sushun had one Empress and two Imperial children.



The emperor's first minister was his powerful uncle, Soga no Umako. Sushun planned to remove the head of the Soga clan from his office. When the plan was discovered, Umako ordered someone to murder Sushun. In the early history of Japan, this is the second time that an emperor is murdered.

This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Sushun. 

According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun"). Sushun is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") which is associated with the burial mound.

Wikipedia:Very good articles/Hurricane Vince (2005)

Hurricane Vince was an unusual hurricane that began in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. It was part of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. The waters where it formed were thought to be too cold for tropical cyclones to exist. Vince was the 20th named storm and 12th hurricane of the season.

The storm that became Vince started out as an extratropical cyclone. It became a subtropical storm on October 8 to the southeast of the Azores. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not officially give the storm a name until the next day. Vince grew into a hurricane before beginning to weaken at sea. On October 11, it made landfall on the Iberian Peninsula in Spain. At that time, it was a tropical depression. It may have been the first storm to hit the area since a hurricane in 1842. Vince died out over Spain. However, it dropped rain in the country. What was left of the storm passed into the Mediterranean Sea.

No. 3 Fighter Sector RAAF

No. 3 Fighter Sector (3FS) was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) unit during World War Two. No. 3FS was responsible for fighter aircraft control and coordination for the Townsville region. 3FS would collect all of the intelligence information from the various D/F stations and VAOC posts, decide on the what needed to be done and then tell the fighter or bomber squadrons to respond. 3FS was in telephone and radio contact with all of the anti-aircraft, searchlight, RDF and HF/DF stations in the Townsville area.

It was first set up at Townsville Grammar School, on 25 February 1942. The Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force members of 3FS lived at St Anne’s Girls School, Townsville. In 1942, a new headquarters for No. 3FS was built at Wulguru, Townsville. The site was a proper military camp site with its own power house, barracks, kitchens, toilets and recreation hall. There were as many as 62 different buildings in 3FS HQ. The camp was on the side of a hill near Mt Stuart, on the west side of the road to Charters Towers. It can still be seen today on the hill on the opposite side of the Stuart Shopping Centre.

No. 3FS was renamed 103 Fighter Control Unit (103 FCU) on 7 March 1944. The Stuart complex was complete and ready to use on 20 December 1944. The main operations building was a bunker made of 30-centimetre (12 in) thick reinforced concrete designed to withstand a direct bomb hit. It had a mezzanine floor and was air-conditioned. 3 Fighter Sector Headquarters had 32 rooms in the large rectangular concrete building with walls forming various passageways. The building still stands today and is 60 by 42 feet (18.3 m × 12.8 m). 
All air raid warnings were started from this bunker by red, yellow and white flares. There was also HQ located in North Ward, Townsville. 103 FCU was disbanded in Townsville on 21 January 1945.

After the war, the buildings were used to house new migrants to Australia. The buildings were still furnished at the time. In 1961 it was purchased by James Cook University of Queensland and was used as a temporary accommodation for students while their residential halls were being built. The bunker itself still had its communication and signals equipment. A few years later the inside of the bunker was destroyed by fire. In 1971 the rest of the buildings were demolished. The site is now owned by the Department of Environment and Resources.

In 1999, a group of people, had been raising money and getting the right equipment to fix this bunker after it was burned and destroyed by fire. They wanted to turn it into a museum. The Department of Environment and Resources have said that the building is not safe. In 2009 the bunker was fenced off. 

Many people in Townsville believe that the bunker may still have ammunition and chemical weapons left over from the war. They also think that the bunker is part of a network of tunnels built during the war in the hills around Townsville. The Department of Defence has said that neither of these claims are true.

A clipper was a very fast sailing ship of the 19th century. The word "clipper" comes from a word meaning: "fast". Clippers had several masts and a square rig. They were quite narrow for their length. Clipper ships were mostly made in British and American shipyards, but France, the Netherlands and other countries also made some. Clippers sailed all over the world, especially on the trade routes between the United Kingdom and its colonies in the east, in trans-Atlantic trade, and the New York-to-San Francisco route round Cape Horn during the California Gold Rush. Dutch clippers were built beginning in 1850s for bringing tea to Europe and taking passengers to and from Java.

Mariinsky Theatre

The Mariinsky Theatre is a famous theatre of opera and ballet in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It was opened in 1860 and soon became the most important theatre for opera and ballet in Russia. Many great operas and ballets of the 19th century were first performed there, including the greatest stage works by Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, and Rimsky-Korsakov.

The Mariinsky Theatre is home to the Mariinsky Ballet, Mariinsky Opera and Mariinsky Orchestra. The conductor Valery Gergiev has been the general director there since 1988.

The theatre is named after Empress Maria Alexandrovna, wife of Tsar Alexander II. There is a bust of the Empress in the main entrance hall. The theatre's name has changed several times during its history, because of different political parties that were in power.

The theatre building is commonly called the "Mariinsky Theatre". The companies that use it have kept the famous "Kirov" name, which it got during the Soviet period in honour of the murdered Leningrad Communist Party leader, Sergey Kirov (1886-1934).

The first ballet groups to perform in St Petersburg were Italian ballet dancers in the early 18th century. Catherine the Great wanted a Russian theatre to be built. It was built in 1783. It was called Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre (“Kamenny” is the Russian word for “stone”. It was used to distinguish the building from the wooden theatre that was being used.). The building we see today dates from 1860. It opened with a performance of Glinka’s opera "A Life for the Tsar". It was called the Mariinsky Theatre, named after the Empress Maria Alexandrovna. The great choreographer Marius Petipa put on the first performances of many famous ballets such as Tchaikovsky’s "The Sleeping Beauty" in 1890, "The Nutcracker" in 1892, Alexander Glazunov's ballet "Raymonda" in 1898, and an updated version of Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake" (with Lev Ivanov) in 1895.

When the theatre became the main home of the Imperial Ballet and Opera in 1886, the theatre was improved. Many operas were performed there, including first performances of Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov", Rimsky-Korsakov's "The Golden Cockerel", Tchaikovsky's "The Queen of Spades" and "Iolanthe", Prokofiev's "Romeo and Juliet" and "Cinderella", and Khachaturian's "Spartacus" were also produced there.

The imperial and Soviet theater was the home of many great impresarios, conductors, and musicians. The Vaganova Academy of Russia Ballet, the ballet school of the Mariinksy Theatre, started the careers of Mathilde Kschessinskaya, Olga Preobrajenskaya, Anna Pavlova, Tamara Karsavina, Vaslav Nijinsky, Marina Semenova, George Balanchine, Galina Ulanova, Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Irina Kolpakova, Galina Mezentseva, Altynai Asylmuratova, and in more recent times famous dancers like Ulyana Lopatkina, Diana Vishneva, and Svetlana Zakharova.

Yuri Temirkanov was Principal Conductor from 1976 to 1988. He conducted many modern and classical operas. Since 1988, Valery Gergiev has brought even more fame to the theatre. It has now got links with many of the world's great opera houses, including the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, the Metropolitan Opera, the Opéra Bastille, La Scala, La Fenice, the Tel Aviv Opera, the Washington National Opera and the San Francisco Opera. Today, the Opera Company regularly tours to most of these cities.

The Port of Hull is a major sea port in the city of Kingston upon Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, England. The port is located on the River Humber which leads to the North Sea. Around one million passengers use the port to get to Rotterdam, The Netherlands and Zeebrugge, Belgium. The port is used for the import of timber in the United Kingdom. The port has its own goods railway which is used to transport cargo inland.

The remaining docks are only the larger ones in the East of the city. Until the 1960s there were some in the city centre such as Humber Dock which became Hull Marina and Junction Dock which is now the site of Princes Quay shopping centre. The Old Dock was filled in and is now Queens Gardens, St Andrews Dock was closed off and silted up (some of it is now a retail park), the Victoria Dock closed in the 1980s and is now a housing estate, the Railway Dock closed in the 1960s and was later used as an extension to the Hull Marina.

The Albert and William Wright Dock is still used for cargo. The fishing industry has also been moved there. The Alexandra Dock closed in the 1980s but soon reopened. It is now also used for cargo. The King George and Queen Elizabeth Docks are used for passengers.

Saint Petersburg Conservatory

The Saint Petersburg Conservatory is a famous music school in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Its full name is N.A. Rimsky-Korsakov Saint Petersburg State Conservatory (). In 2004, the conservatory had around 275 teaching members and 1,400 students.

The conservatory was founded in 1862 by the Russian pianist and composer Anton Rubinstein. When he resigned in 1867, he was followed by Nikolai Zaremba. The great composer Rimsky-Korsakov joined the teaching staff in 1871. The conservatory was named after him in 1944. 

In 1887, Rubinstein returned to the Conservatory to try to improve it. Students who were not very good had to leave, and he also got rid of some of the professors and made the entrance examinations harder. He resigned again in 1891.

The building we see today was built in the 1890s where the Bolshoi Theatre of Saint Petersburg had stood. It still has the grand staircase and landing from that historic theatre. As the city changed its name in the 20th century, the conservatory was renamed "Petrograd Conservatory" (Петроградская консерватория) and then the "Leningrad Conservatory" (Ленинградская консерватория).

Today, it is a famous Russian composition school whose graduates have included great composers such as Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shostakovich. During the 1960s, Shostakovich taught at the conservatory, which made it even more famous.

Mikhail Tal

Mikhail Tal, known as "Mischa", (Riga, 9 November 1936 – Moscow, 28 June 1992) was a Soviet–Latvian chess player, a Grandmaster, and the eighth World Chess Champion.

Tal played in 21 Soviet championships, winning it six times, a record only equalled by Botvinnik. He was a member of eight Soviet teams which won the gold medal in chess Olympiads. He won the individual gold medal five times.

He holds the records for both the first and second longest unbeaten streaks in competitive chess history. Many authorities consider him to have been the greatest attacking player of all time.

Tal won the strong 1958 Interzonal tournament, and the Candidates' tournament in Yugoslavia, 1959. In the Candidates he finished first, with 20/28 points, ahead of Paul Keres with 18.5, followed by Tigran Petrosian, Vasily Smyslov, Bobby Fischer, Svetozar Gligorić, Friðrik Ólafsson, and Pal Benko. Tal he won all four individual games against Fischer, and took 3½ points out of 4 from each of Gligorić, Olafsson, and Benko. This shows his complete dominance over the less strong players.

In 1960, at the age of 23, Tal defeated Mikhail Botvinnik in the Moscow World Championship match, by 12.5–8.5 (six wins, two losses, and thirteen draws). This made him the youngest-ever world champion, a record later broken by Garry Kasparov. Botvinnik, who had never faced Tal before, won the return match against Tal in 1961 by 13–8 (ten wins to five, with six draws). Between the matches Botvinnik thoroughly analyzed Tal's style, and turned most of the return match's games into close manoeuvres and endgames, rather than the complicated tactical melées which were Tal's preference.

Tal's short reign atop the chess world made him one of the two so-called 'winter kings' who interrupted Botvinnik's long reign from 1948 to 1963 (the other was Smyslov, world champion 1957–1958).

Tal played in a total of six Candidates' tournaments and match cycles, though he never again earned the right to play for the world title. In 1962 at Curaçao, he had serious health problems, having undergone a major operation shortly before the tournament, and had to withdraw three-quarters of the way through, scoring just seven points (+3 -10 =8) from 21 games. 

Poor health was part of his life. Tal was an alcoholic, and a chain smoker.<ref name="H/W">Hooper, David and Whyld, Kenneth 1992. "The Oxford companion to chess" 2nd ed, Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-866164-9</ref> At 23 he had a diseased kidney, and his health became uncertain. He recovered much of his form when, after some years, the kidney was removed.

Eleven years after he lost the world championship, he had a record sequence of results. From July 1972 to April 1973, Tal played 86 consecutive games without a loss (47 wins and 39 draws). Between 23 October 1973 and 16 October 1974, he played 95 consecutive games without a loss (46 wins and 49 draws), shattering his previous record. These are the two longest unbeaten streaks in modern chess history.

Tal was a charming and brilliant man, who was always willing to talk about chess with players of all standards. His early death was much mourned, though it was not unexpected. The Mikhail Tal Memorial tournament is held in Moscow each year since 2006 to honour his memory.

The extent of Tal's alcoholism was quite astonishing. Vlastimil Hort, the top Czech player of the 1960s and 70s, has given a vivid account. Hort played at the Moscow tournament of 1963, which had many of the top Russians. When he was due to play Tal, his opponent showed up very late, and drunk. He almost fell asleep at the board. Tal staggered away from the board, and returned, with shaking hands, and unable light a cigarette. Hort later finds out that Tal had been grabbed by other Russians, and doused with cold water! Tal still managed to draw the game.

Tal was an outstanding commentator on his games. These have been translated into English:

Game port

The Game port is a port that is present on some PC hardware, and hardware similar to it. This port lets the connection of analog devices used to control computer games, such as joysticks. In most relevant hardware designs for personal computers in 2010, the port is an integrated component on the sound card, another I/O card, or the motherboard itself. Starting with Windows Vista Microsoft no longer supports this port with drivers from the Operating System, but third party drivers are still available. There are also drivers that allow to map the game port to an USB device. 

Unlike most other ports present on the PC, the Game port is an analog port. This means that signal first needs to be changed to digital form, a task which is usually done by an analog-to-digital converter. In the early days, most joystick designs were digital, which made them easier to build and cheaper. The game port has a 15-pin DSUB interface, most home computers that used digital joysticks had a 9-pin one. This made existing joysticks incompatible with the new interface. 

Digital joysticks are easy for programmers to access. The signal is already digital, and only gets transferred to the PC. Analog signals are much harder to use, they need careful software interrupt driven programming (to get a useful signal). Interrupts use the main CPU of the system. Digital circuits can use Transistor–transistor logic, which does not use the CPU.
The usual implementation of a game port uses a capacitor and a simple voltage comparator. Both together form a sort of simple ramp-compare ADC. This system is polled periodically and reset at precise moments to read an input. This must be done more than 30 times every second to provide a responsive game input. The actual acquisition frequency and value usually depend on the joystick's resistance inside, noise, CPU speed and the total joystick-capacitor's RC time constant.

Its analog nature has also been the cause of a great number of problems. One problem was that all kinds of joysticks needed "calibration". This was true even for arcade-style ones. The reason for this was that no game controller and no joystick produced the same measurements each time. These depended on the exact way acquisition was made. Some of the worse designs even depended on the speed of the CPU. Also, all kinds of PC game ports suffer from electrical noise.

The calibration procedure is still needed at some point, even under modern operating systems such as Windows XP. Usually, it consists of moving the joystick around all of its axes to measure the maximum axis excursion values, no matter if the joystick uses analog signals (from potentiometers) or digital signals (using microswitches or contacts). USB joysticks, on the other hand, do not need calibration. This is because USB sends digital signals.

In the days of DOS, every game using the game port(s) had to do its own calibration, often each time the game started, and some poorly coded calibration routines even failed to work consistently and properly, rendering some joysticks unusable with some games. With Windows XP, only one calibration per joystick is enough, which is thought "valid" until the joystick is unplugged.

Certain applications and games are able to use some analog joysticks even without explicit calibration, under certain restricted conditions. A system of a joystic and game port that is not calibrated can give a "direction", at best. It can not give an intensity. For this setup, an analog joystick can be "self calibrated" just by leaving the joystick in the middle position and taking a measurement, and then using some arbitrary or adaptive threshold to detect movement and excursion from the middle position. The limitation of this method is that the reading of the same joystick over the same game port can change over time, and some joysticks cannot work at all with this method. Also, the joystick must be in the middle position at least once when the implicit "self calibration" takes place, even if this is not directly stated.

Microsoft declared it would no longer include support for game ports in operating systems beginning with MS-Windows XP Professional x64 edition, reasoning that USB-based gaming equipment had become more common. This leaves game port support up to the manufacturer of the device (i.e. Sound card or USB converters) the game port ships on.

Some advanced game port joysticks supports more than 4 buttons (e.g. 6 or 8) but typically require a special device driver for the additional buttons to work properly, since the game port does not have actual hardware support for more than 4 distinct buttons. 

This can be overcome by using pins and input meant for the second joystick (i.e. button 5 through 8 are mapped to the signals to the axis pins meant for the second joystick - resulting in the issue of the two buttons mapped to the same axis being not simultaneously usable), using some normally "unused" pins, or changing the joystick's circuits (and related software) to read a 4-bit state code from the four button inputs, thus giving up to 16 button combinations (albeit with some limitations e.g. some buttons may not be held down) or a combination of both techniques.

High-end game port joysticks such as the Microsoft SideWinder rely on multiplexing a proprietary data stream through the 4 standard button inputs and sometimes through the "unused" pins, achieving full support for a rather high number of buttons (e.g. 16 or 20) while special features such as daisy-chaining multiple joysticks, force feedback or joystick programming become possible in some cases.

The obvious drawback is the need for a special device driver to interpret the joystick input, and making its use time consuming and operating system-dependent, while the joystick is usually unusable without a special driver (unless multiple operating modes are supported).

Some hardware and DIY enthusiasts have found ways to connect a wide array of input devices to the game port and even found other applications for it, such as voltage or current measurement or simple interfacing and data acquisition.

The original game port design by IBM (released in 1981 as a separate expansion card for the first IBM PC) initially allowed four analog axes and four buttons on one port, allowing two joysticks or four paddles to be connected, although this required a special "Y-splitter" cable and is not fully supported by some combined midi/game ports usually found on sound cards.

Some poorly implemented game ports (usually built-in on old motherboards and I/O cards) did not fully support either 4 axes or 4 buttons, making only the use of a single 2-axis and 2-button joystick possible.

The 15-pin game port is no longer provided on presently manufactured PCs, though adapters exist that allow older joysticks and controllers to connect via USB . However, Microsoft's Vista operating system natively lacks all game port support, even for USB adapters.

Game ports use DA-15 connectors (also incorrectly called DB-15). Since the game port moved from dedicated expansion cards to sound cards about 1990, these connectors usually double as connectors for MIDI instruments; two of the redundant +5V and GND pins of the original standard were rededicated to MIDI input and output to make this possible. To use a game port with MIDI instruments, one requires a cable with a male and a female DA-15 and two male 5-pin DIN connectors. The drivers and hardware for the game port midi capabilities are based around the now standard Roland MPU-401 MIDI interface (in UART mode only), and support most MPU-401 standard applications for Windows and DOS. The official "proper design" for a game port-MIDI adapter can be found at this MIDI page.

Clinical trial

A Clinical trial is one of the steps needed to introduce a new drug or therapy. Depending on the drug, either volunteers or patients suffering from a disease or condition are enrolled in a study. In general, a number of the people taking part will receive the real drug, or a good treatment, and the rest of the people will receive a treatment or drug that has no effect, called a placebo. These tests are statistical tests.

Examples of study designs:

Clinical trials were first introduced in Avicenna's "The Canon of Medicine" in 1025 AD, where he laid down rules for the experimental use and testing of drugs. He wrote a precise guide for practical experimentation in the process of discovering and proving the effectiveness of medical drugs and substances. He laid out the following rules and principles for testing the effectiveness of new drugs and medications, which still form the basis of modern clinical trials:


One of the most famous clinical trials was James Lind's demonstration in 1747 that citrus fruits cure scurvy. He compared the effects of various different acidic substances, ranging from vinegar to cider, on groups of afflicted sailors, and found that the group who were given oranges and lemons had largely recovered from scurvy after 6 days.

Frederick Akbar Mahomed (d. 1884), who worked at Guy's Hospital in London, made substantial contributions to the process of clinical trials during his detailed clinical studies, where "he separated chronic nephritis with secondary hypertension from what we now term essential hypertension." He also founded "the Collective Investigation Record for the British Medical Association; this organization collected data from physicians practicing outside the hospital setting and was the precursor of modern collaborative clinical trials."

New York City is the largest city in the United States. Over 8 million people live in it. It is in the state of New York, which is located in the northeastern United States.

The oldest part of the city, the island of Manhattan, still has its original Lenape Native American name. Although Native people such as the Lenape and Canarsees had lived there for many thousands of years, New York City was first explored by Europeans in the 1500's. Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazano found the entrance to New York Harbor in the year 1524 and English explorer Henry Hudson found the Hudson River in 1609.

New York City was settled by Europeans from The Netherlands in 1624. The Dutch called the whole area of New York "Nieuw Nederland" and they named a fort and town on the south end of Manhattan Island Nieuw Amsterdam (New Amsterdam), after the capital city of the Netherlands, which was to become present-day New York. When the English took over the colony in 1664 they changed the name to New York, to honor the Duke of York, who later became King Charles II of England. The Dutch surrendered Nieuw Amsterdam without fighting. They were afraid of the English Navy so they traded the town to England for the colony of Surinam in South America, which they thought was worth more money.

By the time the English came to New York, there were many other Dutch towns in what would become New York City, including Breukelen (Brooklyn), Vlissingen (Flushing), and Nieuw Haarlem (Harlem). There were already some English towns in the area also, such as Gravesend in Brooklyn and Newtown in Queens. Dutch and English people had been living together in New York for a long time.

New York quickly grew to become a large and important port city. Many important battles of the American Revolution were fought in northern Manhattan and in Brooklyn. New York was the capital of the United States from 1789 until 1800. 

In 1898, the cities of New York and Brooklyn merged with the Bronx, Staten Island, and the towns in Queens County to form Greater New York. This is the total area of the City of New York today.

Most of New York City is on three islands near the Atlantic Ocean, although one part is on the mainland of North America. The city includes all of Manhattan Island and Staten Island, and the western end of Long Island. There are also many smaller islands.

The city is divided into five major parts called "boroughs". Each one is also a county. They are:

Water divides a lot of the city. Part of the Hudson River forms the border between Manhattan and the Bronx on one side, and the State of New Jersey on the other side. The East River forms the border between Manhattan on one side, and Brooklyn and Queens on the other side. The Harlem River forms the border between Manhattan and the Bronx (except for a small part of Manhattan that is on the mainland). Part of Long Island Sound forms the border between the Bronx and Queens. Newtown Creek is part of the border between Brooklyn and Queens. Some parts of the city are very separate from the others because of water, such as Far Rockaway in Queens and City Island in The Bronx. A small piece of land in Manhattan is international territory and it belongs to the United Nations to use for its buildings. 

New York City currently has a population of about 8 million people. Over 18 million people live in the city and nearby areas. Most of the New York city population since the 1990s belongs to ethnic groups that are minorities in the US.

The current mayor of New York is Michael Bloomberg, an Independent. The city also has a City Council that makes some local laws. Most laws in New York City are set by the state government in Albany.

Subway transportation is provided by the New York City Subway system, one of the biggest in the world.

Paul Keres

Paul Keres (7 January 1916 – 5 June 1975) was an Estonian chess grandmaster. From about 1937 to 1962 he was one of the top four players in the world.

Keres narrowly missed a chance at a World Chess Championship match on five occasions. He came equal first in the 1938 AVRO tournament, which led to negotiations for a world championship match with Alexander Alekhine, but the match never took place due to World War II. Instead, he played a 14-game match with ex-World Champion Max Euwe in the Netherlands, December 1939 – January 1940. Keres won a hard-fought struggle by 7.5–6.5 (+6 =3 –5). This was a superb achievement: not only was Euwe a former World Champion, but he had enormous experience at match play, far more than Keres. 

Estonia had enjoyed independence after World War I, but was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. Keres came second to Botvinnik in the 1941 Leningrad/Moscow Absolute Championship of the USSR. Soon Estonia was annexed again, this time by the Nazi forces. After the war it was seized again by the Soviet Union.

After the war he took part in the 1948 World Championship match-tournament of five top players, which decided the successor to Alekhine. This was won by Botvinnik, and Keres came equal third with Reshevsky. He was then the runner-up in the Candidates' tournament on four consecutive occasions: 1953, 1956, 1959 and 1962. Keres won the USSR championship three times, in 1947, 1950 and 1951. The latter was probably the strongest-ever Soviet championship; it had ten other players who had played in Candidates' tournaments, three of whom won the world title.

Keres played for the USSR in seven successive Chess Olympiads, wining seven team medals, and five individual board medals. Due to these and other strong results, many commentators consider Keres to be the strongest player never to become World Chess Champion. He was nicknamed "The Crown Prince of Chess".<ref name=H/W>Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. "The Oxford companion to chess". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.</ref>

Keres was always a man, and never missed the opportunity to say he was an Estonian, not a Russian. When he played at the annual Hastings tournament in 1954/55, a KGB man sat on a chair outside his room at night. He was there "to prevent the grandmaster being disturbed". Paul's demeanor at the board was always totally calm. From looking at him, you couldn't tell how much time he had left, or what kind of position he had. He had mastered the art of self-control, and his nickname amongst other players was 'Old Stoneface'. 

Botvinnik thought his death was "the greatest loss suffered by chess since the death of Alekhine". In his opinion, Keres failed to reach the top because of "a tendency to fade somewhat at decisive moments in the struggle". A rumour that the Soviets had persuaded him to lose deliberately to Botvinnik in the 1948 World Championship has no evidence to back it up. 

Keres memorial tournaments are held in Tallinn every two years.

Anne of Austria

Anne of Austria (22 September 1601 – 20 January 1666), Anne d’Autriche in French, was Queen consort of France and Navarre. She also acted as a regent for her son, Louis XIV of France. During her regency (1643–1651) Cardinal Mazarin served as France's chief minister.

The birth of Anne of Austria was at Benavente Palace in Valladolid, Spain. She came into the world just five days before her future husband, Louis XIII. She was baptized "Ana María Mauricia". She was the oldest daughter of Habsburg parents, Philip III of Spain and Margaret of Austria. She was called the "Infanta of Spain and of Portugal", "Archduchess of Austria", "Princess of Burgundy and of the Low Countries". Anne's mother died early at the Valladolid. She died after giving birth to a third daughter, Marguerite. Anne was 11 years old when she was betrothed to Louis XIII. Her father, Philip, gave her a dowry of 500,000 crowns. He also gave her a great number of beautiful jewels. They had some fears that Louis XIII would die early. Anne's father said that if this happened, Anne must return to Spain with her dowry, jewels, and wardrobe. Shortly after, on November 1615, Anne and Louis were married separately, but to one another. This is called a "proxy marriage". They were both 14 years old.

Louis's mother, Marie de' Medici, continued to be the Queen of France. She did not discuss things with her daughter-in-law. Anne, with her Spanish ladies-in-waiting, continued to live according to Spanish custom. She failed to improve her French.

The duc de Luynes tried to make the queen and king closer. He sent away the Spanish ladies and hired French ones instead. Some of the more famous ones are the princesse de Conti and Marie de Rohan-Montbazon, the duchesse de Chevreuse. She was his wife. He also organized court events that would bring the queen and king together more happily. Anne began to dress in the French manner.

However, a number of 'wretched miscarriages' again made their relations cold. On 14 March 1622, while playing with her ladies, Anne fell on the stairs. She suffered her second miscarriage. Louis angrily blamed her. He was also upset with Mme de Luynes for not being careful enough. After this, the King grew to dislike the influence the duchesse de Luynes had over Anne. He disliked the duchesse even more when Luynes died (December 1621). Anne remained without a child for 16 more years.

Through his life Louis had a cool behavior towards Anne. He was always fearful that his wife "had a great passion for the interests of Spain". In 1625 the English George Villiers, 1st duke of Buckingham, shocked the French court by admitting his passion for Anne. Madame de Motteville said that, "if a respectable woman could love a man other than her husband, it would have been Buckingham".

Surprisingly, while there was such a strain between Anne and Louis at this time, Anne suddenly had a baby. Suspicious people suggested that Cardinal Richelieu was the child's parent. Another, more likely suggestion, was that there was one night with a storm that stopped Louis from going to Saint-Maur and made him sleep with the queen instead. This was the night of 5 December 1637. However, the official newspaper, the "Gazette de France", does not mention if they slept in the same room.

A royal birthing-bed was made ready. It was three feet wide, and had two long sticks made of wood for Anne to hold while she was giving birth to her baby. On 4 Saturday September, Anne finally went into labor. She gave birth in the sight of the court. This was so that if her child was a boy, it would not be changed for a girl, or a living baby to a dead one. The child was safely delivered. The "Gazette de France" called it "a marvel when it was least expected", and Anne had a son for the first time in 22 years.

The queen's joy in Louis was very great. One of her servants said, "She takes great joy in playing with him ... it is her great pleasure in life." There are a great number of suggestions as why she did not show such a great love for Monsieur, her second son.

Almost exactly two years after Louis, Anne had another son, Philippe. He was born on 22 September 1640. He was known as 'Monsieur'. This was the official title for the king's second son.

It is said that Anne of Austria died from breast cancer in a convent. Her lady-in-waiting, Madame de Motteville, wrote the story of the queen's life in her Mémoires d'Anne d'Autriche.

2009–10 NHL season

The 2009–10 NHL season was the 92nd season of the National Hockey League (NHL) and the 100th season since the founding of the predecessor National Hockey Association (NHA). It ran from October 1, 2009, including four games in Europe on October 2 and 3—until April 11, 2010, with the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs currently being played, all the way up to early June 2010. A mid-season break from February 15 to February 28 occurred to allow participation of NHL players in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Because of the Winter Olympics break, there was no NHL All-Star Game for 2010.

Teams are ranked (ordered by how many games they won) at the end of the regular season. The team with the most points is ranked number one. If two or more teams are tied in points, the following method is used to rank the teams:


The following players led the league in points at the conclusion of the regular season.
"GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; +/– = Plus/minus; PIM = Penalty minutes"

The following goaltenders led the league in goals against average at the end of the regular season.</small>
"GP = Games played; TOI = Time on ice (minutes); W = Wins; L = Losses; OT = Overtime/shootout losses; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average"

After the regular season, the standard of 16 teams qualified for the playoffs. The Washington Capitals won the Presidents' Trophy for having the best record in the league, at 121 points. Division champions maintain their relative ranking during the entire playoffs while the remaining teams get reseeded below them after each round.



The following is a list of players of note who played their first NHL game in 2009–10, listed with their first team:

Template:Template sandbox notice/doc

This is the template.

It can be placed on template /sandbox pages. It also detects when it is not on a /sandbox page and then shows nothing, thus it can be left in the code when copied and pasted to the main template. (Although most users remove the sandbox notice when they copy the code from the /sandbox to the main template. But beware, if the notice-not-sandbox parameter has been used then the sandbox notice must be copied with the rest of the template code. See more below.)

To learn more about how to use template /sandbox and /testcases subpages see .

Note! The template code must start directly before and physically touch the codice_1 tag. Any blank space or newlines between the template code and the codice_1 tag can cause the template to render unwanted spaces or newlines when used.

This template uses case-insensitive matching, so will match "/Sandbox", "/SandBox", "/sAnDbOx" etc. without any special help.

If the /sandbox page has another name, for instance "/sandbag", then you need to tell the sandbox notice the name of the page, so that it knows when to show and when not to show itself. Like this:

If the testcases page has another name, this may be specified using the testcases-name parameter:
Provided there is only one sandbox or testcases page in use for the particular main page, another option is to move the sandbox page to the standard "/sandbox" name, or testcases to "/testcases". That may be preferable since other templates and tools also assume that the sandbox uses that name, such as .

The sandbox notice can also help showing and hiding other things depending on if it detects it is on the /sandbox page or not. Like this:

The notice-not-sandbox parameter can for instance be used so a protection template can be placed already in the /sandbox version of the code. (See also .) Like this:

Some templates have their documentation on a separate /doc page, and then show that documentation in a green doc box below the template code by using the template. (See also .) Then place the sandbox notice like this:

This example handles both a protection template and a green doc box from a /doc page at the same time. (See also and .) Like this:

The following "complete" example can be used to copy and paste into your template, then delete the parts you don't need:

If there is an accompanying "/testcases" page this template will detect that and show a link to the /testcases page.

This template categorises /sandbox pages into . If you don't want a page to be categorised then use the template like this:

If you want to demonstrate the template on say then you need to feed the subpage-name to make it show and feed an empty category parameter so it doesn't categorise the page. Like this:

Wikipedia:Template test cases

It is recommended to apply the test case pattern to templates using that can generate very different looking output, such as the ones that take many parameters, or the ones that have many branches of the #switch operator.

For navigational boxes, of which the outputs are almost identical on each transcluding page, the benefit may not outweight the time and effort.

Any template that is transcluded in thousands of pages should of course be tested before an edit is made.

The template must be properly documented following .

Furthermore, the template should not have too many interleaving <nowiki><includeonly></nowiki> and <nowiki><noinclude></nowiki> blocks. Ideally there is only one <nowiki><noinclude></nowiki> block, placed at the bottom of the template, and containing the template.

1: Suppose your template is named Template:X. Create a subpage with the name Template:X/sandbox and another with Template:X/testcases. When these subpages are present, the green /doc box produced by automatically provide links to them. Note that "/sandbox" and "/testcases" are spelled in all lower-case.

2: Copy only the code (everything that is not surrounded by <nowiki><noinclude></nowiki>) from your Template:X to Template:X/sandbox. And add the following at the end of the last line, in the same line:

In other words, the result should be:

Note! The template code must start directly before and physically touch the codice_3 tag. Any blank space or newlines between the template code and the codice_3 tag can cause the template to render unwanted spaces or newlines when used.

3: Copy a few transcluding examples from articles (<nowiki></nowiki>) to your Template:X/testcases. In the test case subpage, duplicate each example, and for one copy of each example, replace X with X/sandbox. This is done so that you may compare the old and new outputs side by side in the future. Lastly, add the following line at the beginning of the test case page. It does not matter how many blank lines you put around it:

4: Thus Template:X/testcases will look like this:
4b: To make differences easier to identify, you can use to lay out your test cases. Then, test cases which are changed in the sandbox are highlighted so you can double check that the change was intentional.

Death of a Salesman

Death of a Salesman is a 1949 tragedy play which was written by Arthur Miller. 

Willy Loman - Willy is the main character of the play. He is 63 years old 
and he is a terrible salesman. He has a flawed vision of the American Dream that 
if someone is "well liked", they can succeed. He often cannot tell the difference 
between fantasy and reality. He does not like change and he often day dreams about 
the past. He tries several times to kill himself so that the insurance money can 
go to his children.

Linda Loman - The wife of Willy. She gives the family strong emotional support 
during the tough times when the family needs it the most. She defends her husband 
Willy when her children start complaining about him. 

Biff Loman - Biff is the 34 year old son of Willy and Linda. He was well liked 
during high school, but he did not graduate. During high school, he developed a habit 
of stealing things (his father supported it), which would later get him fired from 
several jobs. Biff eventually realizes that Willy's vision of the American Dream is 
wrong and he often argues against him. He wants to go out west to Texas and start a farm.

Harold Loman - Harold is usually called by his nickname "Happy" (the word happy is 
used with sarcasm. Happy has always lived in the shadow of his older brother, Biff, 
who was more popular and likable than he is. His parents (Linda and Willy) usually do 
not pay attention to him and act like he is invisible. Happy believes in Willy's 
incorrect vision of the American Dream and is at risk of becoming just like his father. 

The Woman - The woman is Willy's mistress. While Biff and Happy were in high 
school, Willy Loman cheated on his wife and had a relationship with the woman.

Charley - Charley is one of Willy's only true friends. Charley offers Willy a job, 
but Willy refuses. He felt bad for Willy's bad financial situation, so he gives Willy 
money each week that Willy pretends is his pay.

Bernard - Bernard is the son of Charley. While Bernard was in high school, Willy 
made fun of him for studying too hard and said that he was "liked, but not well liked". 
Bernard became a successful lawyer who got to argue a case in front of the U.S. Supreme 
Court.

Ben - Ben is Willy's brother who passed away. Willy in his daydreams sees Ben 
as a person who entered the jungles of Africa at age 17, and came out of Africa as 
a very rich man.

The theme of Death of a Salesman is Miller's criticism of capitalism and he tries to express that the American Dream does not happen to everybody. He also tries to express that being well liked is not enough to succeed, because success requires skill also.

Continuum hypothesis

The continuum hypothesis is a hypothesis that there is no set that is both bigger than that of the natural numbers and smaller than that of the real numbers. Georg Cantor stated this hypothesis in 1877.

There are infinitely many natural numbers, the cardinality of the set of natural numbers is infinite. This is also true for the set of real numbers, but there are more real numbers than natural numbers. We say that the natural numbers have infinite cardinality and the real numbers have infinite cardinality, but the cardinality of the real numbers is greater than the cardinality of the natural numbers.

This hypothesis is the first problem on the list of 23 problems David Hilbert published in 1900. Kurt Gödel showed in 1939, that the hypothesis cannot be falsified using Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. The Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory is the set theory commonly used in mathematics. Paul Cohen showed in the 1960s that the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory cannot be use to prove the continuum hypothesis, either. For this, Cohen was awarded the Fields medal.

<doc id="238032" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238032" title="The Fountainhead">
The Fountainhead

The Fountainhead is a fiction book written by Ayn Rand. The book was first printed in 1943.

The book is split into four parts, named after a person in the story. These are the parts:


The book starts in 1922 in a fictional university called Stanton. The first character (person) you meet in the book is Howard Roark. He has just been expelled from America's best college for architects, Stanton. He is expelled because he only wants to design modern buildings that are creative, but his professors want him to design old buildings.

Howard believes that buildings can be beautiful on their own, and they don't need to have lots of extra things added. He thinks that you can build a house out of glass, concrete and steel and it will be beautiful. Rand wanted Roark to think this because she wanted the reader to know that new and creative ideas are good and traditions are silly.

Roark's roommate, Peter Keating, is given an award when he graduates. He graduates just after Roark is expelled. Keating is offered a job in New York at Francon & Heyer, a firm (a place where people work) that makes traditional buildings.

Roark leaves college and goes to New York, so he can find Henry Cameron, his hero and the architect who invented Skyscrapers. He gets a job at Cameron's firm, because Cameron thinks he has potential.

Roark works at Cameron's office designing buildings and not earning a lot of money while Keating becomes rich because he designs traditional buildings for millionaires who don't have any idea how beautiful modern buildings can be.

Keating also meets his old girlfriend, Catherine Halsey. She is a shy girl and wrongly thinks she will become happy by spending all her time helping others instead of being creative. Catherine also tells Keating that her Uncle is Ellsworth Toohey, a respected writer for a Wynand newspaper called the "Banner". Keating wants to meet Toohey, because he is an architecture expert and can get Keating new jobs and more money. But Keating doesn't want to meet Toohey until he is more famous, so that he can impress Toohey. 

In the novel Keeting is always trying to impress others because he cares what other people think and he is angry when he comes second.

At the same time, Roark loses his job with Cameron because Cameron becomes very ill and has to retire. Roark goes and finds new jobs but is always turned down because he is too original. Keating wants Roark to work for him so that he can steal some of Roark's ideas. Keating decides to help Roark, because Roark has finished some of his projects at college and at Francon & Heyer.

Roark works for Francon & Heyer for a few days but when he asks if he can do a building in a modern style, he is told he has to leave or design the building in an old fashion style. He leaves and goes to many other firms. He eventually works for John Eric Snyte, an architect who hires Roark because Snyte likes to mix different styles.

A famous writer, Austin Heller comes to Snyte and asks for a house. Snyte gives all the architects a job of designing the house and then he mixes all the sketches. Heller says he only likes the modern parts and Roark tears up the drawings, telling Heller that wants to design the house on his own. Snyte fires Roark, but it is too late because Heller has accepted the deal and Roark is allowed to design the house on his own.

This is a very important theme in the book. Roark never lets anyone mix together his design and other people's, because he thinks that creativity comes from the mind and a mind is unique(special) to one person.

Roark is now working for himself and he ges to design Heller's house, which leans over a cliff, and a number of other buildings. Roark is very proud and turns down a lot of new jobs because he hates designing old buildings. He becomes so poor he has to close his business and he wont take any money from Heller, who is now his good friend.

Roark has to ask Mike, a man who he met an a building site when he was inspecting one of his jobs, to get him a job in Connecticut, in a quarry.

At the same time, Keating is going to marry Catherine, but the boss of Francon & Heyer, Guy Francon, tries to introduce him to his daughter, Dominique. Dominique is cold and uncaring. She also writes for the Banner and knows Ellsworth Toohey. Dominique eventually meets Keating briefly when Guy Francon demands that she says sorry for writing a bad review of a traditional building that has just been built. The building was made by one of Guy's friends and he is embarrassed.

Keating meets Dominique after her and Guy argue and she makes fun of Keating. She can tell he is a failure and she doesn't want to speak with him.

She keeps writing bad reviews of buildings that are being made by the mediocre (people who have no talent) architects. She is very lonely because all she has to make her happy is embarrassing her father and making fun of other architects.

She goes on holiday in the Summer to her father's country house in Connecticut. Guy Francon owns the house and the quarry. She is walking one day and meets Roark. She is attracted to him because he is drilling some granite in the quarry and he looks masculine to Dominique. She comes back and visits him every day but always rude to him and never says how much she is attracted to him. Roark doesn't mind about being spoken to rudely. Dominique goes back to her house and breaks her fireplace of perpose so that Roark will have to come up and fix it from the quarry and she can see him again.

He arrives and rapes Dominique. This part of the book is talked about a lot because Roark doesn't want to hurt her, so some people say it is not a rape. He knows she feels lonely and she can't say how she feels about him. Roark leaves and getss a phone call saying a rich business man wants him to design a new shop for him. The business man saw Heller's house and tried to find Roark. Roark travels back to New York...

Howard Roark
A gifted architect who is expelled from college for trying to be too original. He is unwilling to compromise and he doesn't care what people think about him.

Rand made Roark like this to show us how a person would be if they followed Objectivism. This was her philosophy about life.

Peter Keating
He planned to become rich by just following what was popular, rather than being original like Roark. He said that because of that, he would be more successful than Roark. In the end, Keating admits that he is a failure and he was being used.

Ellsworth Toohey
He is the antagonist (the bad guy) of the story. He tries to stop Roark from being successful by controlling weak-minded people. He believes in collectivism (when people join a group and they lose their own identity) and only helps people who are average and mediocre (not very talented). Dominique believes he is trying to control the Wynand newspapers.

Gail Wynand
He is the owner of a newspaper that appeals to the opinion of the public. He realizes that he is a failure because of he made his newspaper company so people will read it and he can become rich. Rand says that you should only work at something you love, so if you want to run a newspaper, you should only do it because you love writing about important things. 

Cameron said that Wynand was his enemy, because he wrote a newspaper that supported collectivism. Wynand understands that he is unhappy and becomes friends with Roark because he respects him.

Henry Cameron
Roark's mentor. He invented Skyscrapers and designed modern buildings that most architects hated, because they weren't traditional enough. Cameron becomes an alcoholic and dies early in the novel.

Dominique Francon
She is a woman who fears having great things such as love because society can destroy those great things. She marries Peter Keating first, then Gail Wynand. Roark changes her view of life and marries her.

Architecture and skyscrapers in this novel are used to symbolize the ability of humans to do great things.

Basically, the theme of the novel is Rand's idea that being selfish can be a good thing, while being selfless can make a person a servant to other people. This novel has many themes that support ideas such as Objectivism, and Capitalism. This novel has many themes that are against ideas like Communism and Altruism.

A Raisin In The Sun

A Raisin In The Sun is an American play that was written by Lorraine Hansberry in 1959. It is about a poor African American family who receives $10,000 in inheritance money. The family has to decide how to spend the money.

Walter - He is the main character of the play and the father. He is a cab driver who has the dream of being a bartender who is wealthy and successful. He takes most of the $10,000 to invest it in a bar. He realizes that he was scammed and he lost all of the money (which angered Mama). He was offered thousands of dollars to move out of the neighborhood (because African Americans living in a white neighborhood lowered the value of the houses). Throughout the play, he considers the offer, but at the end he says no. Walter, at the end of the play, may have lost a lot of money, but he keeps his dignity and learns a big lesson. 

Travis - Walter's 10 or 11-year old son who admires his father. He represents the theme of innocence.

Ruth - Walter's wife and emotional support of the family. While Walter has his dreams and fantasies about being rich and successful, Ruth brings him back to reality.

Mama - The grandmother (wife of the grandfather). She is very old fashioned and religious. She is a strong-willed woman.

Beneatha - Beneatha is the sister of Walter. She tries to be an independent person by trying to learn more about African cultures, rather than conforming to the style of living that Americans have been accustomed to.

Arctic fox

The Arctic Fox, (also called as the White Fox, Polar Fox or Snow Fox), is a small fox. It lives in the Arctic (North Pole). The Arctic Fox is about 10-12 inches high (25-30cm) and it weighs from 6 to 10 pounds (2.7-4.5 kg). The Arctic Fox has a round body shape, short nose and legs, and short, fluffy ears. It has the thickest fur of any animal in the world. In winter its fur is white to look like the snow and in the summer months it changes to brown. Arctic Foxes live for about 3 to 6 years. Its fur changes color with the seasons.
This fox can live in the cold north even when it is -50°C. Their thick fur keeps them warm. Its broad, fluffy paws let it walk on ice and snow to look for food. The Arctic Fox has very good ears so that it can hear small animals under the snow. When it hears an animal under the snow, it jumps and punches through the snow to catch its victim. The Arctic Fox eats any meat it can find. They eat lemmings, arctic hares, eggs and dead bodies of animals. The foxes also eat plants sometimes.
It takes 53 days for the pups to grow in the mother before they are born. The mother can produce 5-8 cubs but sometimes as many as 25. Both the mother and the father help to raise their young pups. The young females leave the family and form their own groups and the males stay with the family. Arctic Foxes form pairs in the breeding season. Litters are born in the early summer. The parents raise the young in a large den under the ground. The pups are born with brown fur and as they grow older it turns white.

Template:Location map skew/doc

Creates a location map as a of an existing map in either equirectangular projection or skewed projection, with multiple (up to 4) markers and optional labels superimposed onto it. This template functions in the style of , but can auto-skew longitudes and allows 4 markers and labels (rather than just one marker). Note: For brevity, parameters "pos" & "bg" are aliases (for parameters "position" & "background").

 <nowiki></nowiki>

Parameter "locname" refers to {Template:Location map "locname"} containing the image name and coordinates of a particular map.

BEWARE: Omit "px" from "marksize" or "width" or else the map
might span entire screen. The MediaWiki-language coding of the template cannot detect "px" inside numeric parameters.

List of live templates named "Template:Location_map_skew_<locname>" (without "Template:" prefix here):


The map and markers are implemented using the typical wiki parser-functions (<nowiki>""</nowiki>), described at: "WikiMedia Help:ParserFunctions".

The skewing of map coordinates, when placing markers/labels on the map image, is performed by a linear interpolation of the longitude relative to the height of the latitude (higher latitudes skew longitude more). A skew factor < 1.0 squeezes longitudes together near top, while a skew factor > 1.0 spreads longitudes apart near the top.

The formula is roughly:

The map with markers/labels is implemented as nested HTML divisions. The map-image is in an HTML division, containing each point as a percent-locator division containing a marker-image sub-division plus a label sub-division. Each point is calculated (for a percent-locator division) with X or Y coordinate "XX.X%" or "YY.Y%" as follows:


Accuracy of numeric calculations depends on the particular wiki server handling the webpage.

Aida

Aida is an opera by the Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi. It is pronounced “ah-EE-dah”. It is sometimes spelt Aïda. It is one of the most well-known of all grand operas. There are several scenes which can be staged with very lavish scenery. The singers must have very powerful voices, especially in Act II, which has a lot of music for the big chorus.

The opera, which is divided into four acts is based on a story written by a French Egyptologist called Auguste Mariette. The librettist Antonio Ghislanzoni wrote the words for Verdi to set to music. The opera was first performed at the Khedivial Opera House in Cairo on 24 December 1871. It soon became very popular in opera houses in Italy and throughout the world.

Aida is the name of the main female character in the opera. It is an Arabic girl’s name which means "visitor" or "returning".

The story is supposed to take place in the days of Ancient Egypt, several thousand years ago. No exact date is given.

"Scene 1: A hall in the palace of the King of Egypt."

The Egyptians have been having a war with the Ethiopians, who want to invade their country. Radames is a young Egyptian soldier. The high priest tells him that the Ethiopians might soon attack again. Radames would like to be made the head of the Egyptian army. He wants this, not just to get military glory, but because he hopes it will enable him to marry Aida. Aida is an Ethiopian girl who has been captured and made a slave of Amneris, daughter of the King of Egypt. Aida is actually the daughter of the King of Ethiopia, but the Egyptians do not know that. The reason that Amonasro, the King of Ethiopia, wants to invade Egypt again is to try to free his daughter.

Amneris is in love with Radames. She would like him to be a military hero. She is worried that he is in love with someone else. She notices how he looks disturbed when Aida comes in and wonders whether she is the girl Radames loves.

The King, the High Priest, Ramfis, and the whole palace court enter. A messenger announces that the Ethiopians, led by King Amonasro, are marching towards Thebes. The King says that the Egyptians must fight the Ethiopians, and he makes Radames leader of the army. The crowd wish him good luck. Aida, too, wants Radames to be a hero, but also realizes that he will be fighting her own people.

"Scene 2: Inside the Temple of Vulcan" 

Important ceremonies and dances take place in the temple. Ramades is made leader of the army. The crowd pray for the victory of Egypt.

"Scene 1: The chamber of Amneris"

Act 2 takes place two years later. Ramades and the Egyptian army have won their battle against the Ethiopians. Dances take place to celebrate the victory. Amneris wants to find out whether Aida and Radames really do love one another. She talks to Aida. She pretends to be sorry that the Ethiopians (Aida’s people) have lost their battle. Aida says she cannot be happy until she knows what has happened to her father and brothers. Amneris now tells Aida a lie. She tells her that Radames has been killed. When Aida breaks down in tears, Amneris tells her that it was not true, and that Radames is alive. Aida is relieved to hear this. Amneris is now angry. She tells Aida that she knows she and Radames are in love. She tells her that she herself also loves him. She threatens Aida, telling her that she, Aida, will crawl in the dust while she, Amneris, is made queen.

"Scene 2: The grand gate of the city of Thebes"

Radames and the Egyptian army march into the city to celebrate their victory. The Ethiopians who have been captured are brought before the crowd. One of them is the Ethiopian king, Amonasro, father of Aida, although the Egyptians do not know who he is. Aida rushes to her father. She explains to the crowd that Amonasro is her father. Amonasro tells the Egyptians a lie: he says that the Ethiopian king (he himself, of course) has been killed in battle. Aida, Amonasro and the captured Ethiopians all plead with the Egyptian King to save them, but the Egyptians want them to be put to death. Radames pleads with the king to spare Aida and Amonasro. The King rewards Radames by saying he can be King of Egypt and that he can marry his daughter, Amneris.

Aida and Amonasro remain as hostages to make sure that the Ethiopians do not take revenge for their defeat.

"On the banks of the Nile, near the Temple of Isis"

As Amneris goes to pray before her wedding, the priests chant prayers. Aida wonders why Radames wants to meet her. Amonasro goes to Aida and tells her she must find out from her lover, Radames, which way the Egyptian army are going to march to fight the Ethiopians. Aida refuses to do this at first, but her father says that, if she doesn’t and her people are killed, it will be her fault. She changes her mind.

When Radames comes she suggests to him that they flee together. Radames refuses at first, but Aida manages to persuade him. He tells her the route the army are going to take. Amonasro, who has been listening secretly, then comes out of hiding and reveals that he is the King of Ethiopia. Radames feels he has betrayed his country because he revealed a military secret. He refuses to flee with Aida and her father. The guards capture him.

"Scene 1: A hall in the Temple of Justice. To one side is the door leading to Radames' prison cell"

Amneris asks to see Radames. Radames refuses to defend himself. He is relieved to hear Aida is still alive and that she hopes to get back to her own country. Amneris does not like to hear him say this. Radames is tried before the court. He refuses to defend himself, and he is sentenced to death.

"Scene 2: The Vault in the Temple"

Amneris wants to try to save Radames, who is a prisoner in a dark vault. Radames thinks he is alone. He is astonished and unbelievably happy when he finds Aida there. She had hidden herself in the vault. She tells him that she wants to die with him. That is their fate. 

The music of the opera is excellent all the way through. There are quiet songs of incredible beauty as well as big chorus numbers. The music is all famous, but among the most well-known parts are the aria that Radames sings near the beginning of act One in which he dreams of victory in battle and marrying Aida, the Ethiopian slave. The song is called "Celeste Aida" - "Heavenly Aïda"). The Chorus in Scene ii of Act II, "Gloria all'Egitto, ad Iside" ("Glory to Egypt, to Isis!") is one of the most famous marches ever written.

The opera has been adapted for movies several times, e.g. in a film made in 1953 starring Lois Maxwell and Sophia Loren, and a Swedish production in 1987.

Atropine

Atropine is a tropane alkaloid, that can be extracted from the Deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna), mandrake (Mandragora officinarum) and certain other plants. It is mainly used as a drug. Atropine can be deadly. The substance derives its name from Atropos, one of the three Fates. In Greek mythology, the Fates chose how a person was to die. Atropine is a "core" medicine in the World Health Organization's "Essential Drugs List", which is a list of minimum medical needs for a basic health care system.

The second part of the Latin name ("belladonna", "pretty woman") comes from the fact that it can be used to temporarily disable the eye's adaptation to light - this will lead to "big" pupils, which were considered pretty in a woman of the Renaissance. Atropine can also be used to resuscitate patients that have gone into cardiac arrest. It can also be used as an antidote to certain poison gases and insecticides.

Townsville, Queensland

Townsville is a city on the northern east coast of Queensland. It is the largest regional city in Queensland and in 2010 was made a second capital by Premier Anna Bligh to take the stress of governing off the southeast corner of Queensland.
Before the city was made a capital, Townsville was often referred to as the capital of North Queensland, but the split of the state never occurred. 

Popular attractions include 'The Strand', a long tropical beach and garden strip; Riverway, a riverfront parkland attraction located on the banks of Ross River; Reef HQ, a large tropical aquarium holding many of the Great Barrier Reef's native flora and fauna; the Museum of Tropical Queensland, built around a display of relics from the sunken British warship HMS Pandora; and Magnetic Island, a large neighbouring island, the vast majority of which is national park.

English explorer James Cook, went by the area where Townsville was established in 1770, but did not land. Townsville City was established in 1863 by English explorer Robert Towns to build a new port for Australia. Since then Townsville grew into a livable city as people began moving to up to the city.

During WWII Townsville was used by the Americans as a military base. There were many airbases, bunkers, tunnels and fortifications around Townsville, some of these forts are still visible, where as others have sadly been demolished.

These still standing forts include


Townsville was once referred to as Australia's Saviour, but this slowly faded away as history from the war in Townsville was destroyed to hide tunnels from the public.

On Christmas Eve in 1971, Townsville was hit by Tropical Cyclone Althea, which destroyed the port almost completely. In 1982 Flinders Street in the CBD was closed to traffic and turned into a shopping mall. The Strand Beach was redeveloped into a tropical beach park with features such as a waterpark, the rockpool, and the War Museum.

Kronborg

Kronborg is near the town of Helsingør on the extreme north-east part of Zealand. It is at the narrowest point of the Øresund, the sound between Denmark and Sweden. In this part, the sound is only 4 km wide. This is why it is so important to keep a fortress at this place commanding one of the few outlets of the Baltic Sea. The castle has for centuries been one of the most important Renaissance castles in Northern Europe. It was added to UNESCO's World Heritage Sites list on November 30, 2000. People know Kronborg well as "Elsinore". This is the place where the play "Hamlet, Prince of Denmark", written by William Shakespeare, is supposed to have happened. Hamlet was performed in the castle for the first time on the 200th anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare. The soldiers from the castle were some of the players.

Christian IV of Denmark

Christian IV (12 April 1577 – 28 February 1648) was the king of Denmark-Norway from 1588 until his death. He had a rule of more than 59 years. Because of this, he has the longest rule of all the kings of Denmark. He is sometimes referred to as "Christian Firtal" in Denmark and "Christian Kvart" or "Quart" in Norway.

Christian was the son of Frederick II, king of Denmark-Norway, and Sofie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He was born at Frederiksborg castle in 1577. He succeeded the throne at 11, when his father died on 4 April 1588. While he was still growing up, chancellor Niels Kaas and the "Rigsraadet" council served as helpers of the royal power. He received a good education. He was a strong-willed and clever student. At the age of 18, Christian became king on 17 August 1596.

On 30 November 1597, he married Anne Catherine of Brandenburg, a daughter of Joachim Friedrich, margrave of Brandenburg and duke of Prussia. The queen died 14 years later, after giving birth to six children. Four years after her death the king privately married a beautiful young gentlewoman, Kirsten Munk. Through her he had 12 children. However, this marriage was to be very bad to Denmark.

In the course of 1628 he discovered an affair of his wife, Kirsten Munk, with one of his German officers. When he put her away she tried to cover up her own disgrace by suggesting an affair between one of her fired maids and the king. In January 1630 they separated completely. Kirsten went away to Jutland. Meanwhile Christian openly declared Vibeke as his mistress. She gave birth to a large family. Vibeke's children were of course the natural enemies of the children of Kirsten Munk. The anger of the two families influenced the future history of Denmark.

<doc id="238251" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238251" title="Sex determination">
Sex determination

Sex determination is a process of development by which the sex of an individual is settled. Sex is a method of reproduction which is widespread among living things. It requires two individuals of the same species. 

Usually the sexes are separate. Sex may be determined in one of two ways:

Where both sexes occur on the same individual, that individual is an hermaphrodite. Hermaphrodite systems can be found in some animals, for example snails, and in most flowering plants.

For many species sex is determined by environmental factors experienced during development. Many reptiles have temperature-dependent sex determination. The temperature embryos experience during their development determines the sex of the organism. In some turtles, for example, males are produced at lower incubation temperatures than females; this difference in critical temperatures can be as little as 1-2°C.

Many fish change sex over the course of their life. This phenomenon is called "sequential hermaphroditism". In clownfish, smaller fish are male, and the dominant and largest fish in a group becomes female. In many wrasse the opposite is true—most fish are female at birth and become male when they reach a certain size. Sequential hermaphrodites may produce both types of gametes over the course of their lifetime, but at any given point they are either female or male.

In some ferns the default sex is hermaphrodite, but ferns which grow in soil that has previously supported hermaphrodites are influenced by hormones remaining to develop as male.

The most usual way to determine sex is by genes. That way, an organism's sex is determined by the genome it gets. 
The alleles that influence sexual development may or may not be on the same chromosome. If they are, that chromosome is called a sex chromosome, and the genes on it are called 'sex linked'. Sex is determined either by the fact that there is a sex chromosome (which can be missing), or by the number of them. Because genetic sex determination is determined by matching chromosomes, there are usually the same number of male and female offspring.

Humans and other mammals have an XY sex determination system: the Y chromosome carries factors responsible for male development. The default sex, in the absence of a Y chromosome, is female. XX mammals are female and XY are male. XY sex determination is also found in other organisms, including the common fruit fly and some plants. In some cases, including in the fruit fly, it is the number of X chromosomes that determines sex rather than the presence of a Y chromosome.

Birds have a system that works the other way round: It is called "ZW sex-determination system". The W chromosome has factors for female development. By default (if the chromosome is missing), the organism will be male. In this case ZZ individuals are male and ZW are female. The majority of butterflies and moths also have a ZW sex-determination system. In both XY and ZW sex determination systems the sex chromosome carrying the critical factors is often significantly smaller, carrying little more than the genes necessary for triggering the development of a given sex.

Many insects use a sex determination system based on the number of sex chromosomes. This is called XX/XO sex determination—the O indicates the absence of the sex chromosome. All other chromosomes in these organisms are diploid, but organisms may inherit one or two X chromosomes. In field crickets, for example, insects with a single X chromosome develop as male, while those with two develop as female. In the nematode "C. elegans" most worms are self-fertilizing XX hermaphrodites, but occasionally abnormalities in chromosome inheritance regularly give rise to individuals with only one X chromosome—these XO individuals are fertile males (and half their offspring are male).

Other insects, including honey bees and ants, use a haploid-diploid sex-determination system. In this case diploid individuals are generally female, and haploid individuals (which develop from unfertilized eggs) are male. This sex-determination system results in a highly biased sex ratio, as the sex of offspring is determined by fertilization rather than the assortment of chromosomes during meiosis.

Sometimes an organism develops the appearance of both males and females. It is then an intersex, and is rare. Even though such organisms may be called hermaphrodites, this is not correct, because in intersex individuals either the male or the female aspect is sterile.

Sketches by Boz

Sketches by "Boz," Illustrative of Every-day Life and Every-day People (usually known as Sketches by Boz) is a collection of short pieces written by Charles Dickens. The book was published in 1836. The first edition was illustrated by George Cruikshank.

The first edition of "Sketches by Boz" was published by John Macrone in two series. The first series was a two-volume set which was published in February 1836. This was just a month before the publication of the first parts of "The Pickwick Papers" (1836-37). The "Second Series" was published in August 1836. After Dickens became famous, he could buy out his agreements with Macrone. Macrone died unexpectedly at 28. Dickens helped to publish a book called "The Pic-Nic Papers" to help Macrone's widow and children.

Most of the fifty-six sketches that appear in the 1839 edition were originally published individually in various newspapers and periodicals. These included "The Morning Chronicle", "The Evening Chronicle", "The Monthly Magazine", "The Carlton Chronicle" and "Bell's Life in London", from 1833 to 1836:

He won many awards that year, including the Cy Young Award. He also set a Royals team record for the most strikeouts in one game on August 25, 2009, when he struck out 15 batters against the Cleveland Indians.

Greinke became frustrated with the Royals losing so many games, and asked the team to trade him. He was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers in December 2009.

Scheherazade

Scheherazade is a legendary Persian queen who is the storyteller in "One Thousand and One Nights".

The story, which was written many hundreds of years ago, tells of a Persian king who married a young girl every night. At the end of every night she would send his new wife to have her head chopped off. He had already killed 3000 women in this way.

Then, one day, Scheherazade heard about the king. She said she wanted to spend the night with him. Her father disagreed, but she still went. She spent all night telling him a story. At the end of the night she stopped the story at an exciting moment. The king wanted to hear the end of the story, but Scheherazade said he would have to wait until the next night to hear the rest.

The next night she finished the story and began another one, which she again stopped when it was dawn. The king had to wait another night to hear the rest of the story. Scheherazade kept this up for 1001 nights. She told him 1001 stories. In the end the king had fallen in love with Scheherazade and they already had three children, so he did not have her executed.

The main part of these stories is formed by an old Persian book called "Hezar-afsana" or the "Thousand Myths" (Persian: هزارافسانه).

Stretching

Stretching is a kind of physical fitness exercise in which a muscle (or muscle group) is stretched on purpose to its fullest length in order to help the muscle's elasticity and its tone. This helps a person have better control of his or her muscles and be more flexible.

Stretching, in its most basic form, is a natural and instinctive activity; it is done by many animals including humans. It may be done while yawning. Stretching often is done instinctively after waking from sleep, after long periods of being inactive, or after leaving small spaces and areas.

Many athletes and dancers stretch deliberately before or after exercise in order to enhance performance and reduce injury.

Sunbelt

The "Sun Belt" is a term for states in the southwestern and southeastern United States. Many people moved to these states from northern states in the years since World War II. A lot of older and retired people live there; these people are called "snowbirds" because they retired to a place with better weather than where they lived before. These places have large suburbs such as Sun City, Arizona, Lakewood, California, and Hialeah, Florida. States that are the best examples of the Sun Belt are California, Florida, and Arizona.

There is a college sports conference called the Sun Belt.

Serpopard

A serpopard is a mythological animal, often seen carved on cosmetic palettes (used for mixing antimony as eye shadow), during the Old Kingdom of Egypt. These palettes were made in the earliest days of history, before the pharaohs. 

A serpopard looks like a leopard; however it has a very long neck unlike a leopard. In the carved pictures, they are seen being led by ropes and harnesses while they serve the Egyptians as domesticated animals. Skilled Egyptian artists always carved real animals in exactly the right shape, but the serpopard is thought to be only a mythological creature. In a later time, a similar creature would be shown in the art of Sumer and Elam.

Plott Hound

The Plott Hound is a medium size dog. They are usually 20-25 inches tall (51-61 cm). Plott Hounds weigh about 45-55 pounds (20-25 kg). They are well-muscled and strong. The Plotts have double coats which are smooth and glossy. They can be any shade of brown, black, or tan. The coat has a striped pattern. They usually have a white patch on the chest. The head is flat with a long muzzle. The Plott hounds ears are wide and medium in length.

In 1750, two brothers called Plott left Germany to live in America. They took five Hanoverian Hounds with them. One brother, Jonathon Plott, settled in North Carolina with his five dogs. In North Carolina he bred his five Hanoverian Hounds with bloodhounds and other mixed breed dogs. The new breed of dogs was called the Plott hound. These dogs were used for hunting.

Plott Hounds are sometimes used for coon hunting. The Plotts are loyal, smart, athletic, steady, friendly, relaxed and alert to their surroundings. Plott Hounds tend to bark a lot. They are good gentle family dogs and get along with children. Other small pets are fine in the house but could be a problem in an outside setting since the dogs may try to hunt them.
Plott Hounds have short coats. Using a comb or brush will easily remove any dead hair. Also the dog’s ears may have build-up or infections. The ears should be checked and cleaned regularly. If a hound is used for hunting, check the pads on the feet, nails, ears, or for fleas.

Plott Hounds tend to eat fast. If they do eat fast the stomach might twist. This is a life threatening problem called gastric torsion. Plott Hounds live around 10-14 years and are a fairly healthy breed. Plott Hounds are also active dogs and need a lot of physical exercise.

Mary Cassatt

Mary Stevenson Cassatt (May 22, 1844 – June 14, 1926) was an American artist. She lived in France for many years. 
She often painted mothers and children.

Cassatt was born in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania, which is now part of Pittsburgh, to rich parents. As a child, she travelled a lot in Europe, including visits to London, Paris, and Berlin. Back in the US, she studies at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 

She moved to Paris, France in 1866, returning to the US in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War. 

Degas influenced Cassatt. She used pastels, making many important works with them. He also taught her etching. 
She was busy in the 1890s. She became less blunt in her opinions. Other American artists sought her advice. Among them was Lucy A. Bacon. ,

From 1891 to 1893, she painted a large mural for the 1893 Chigago World's Fair (Columbian Exposition). The mural had three parts - the central theme was "Young Women Plucking the Fruits of Knowledge or Science." The left panel was "Young Girls Pursuing Fame" and the right panel "Arts, Music, Dancing." The mural was lost after the fair was over. 
She died on June 14, 1926 at Château de Beaufresne, near Paris, and was buried in the family vault at Le Mesnil-Théribus, France.

Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852), born Augusta Ada Byron, was an English writer who became the world's first computer programmer. She wrote the program for Charles Babbage's mechanical computer, the analytical engine. She wrote the first algorithm that was meant to be processed by a machine.

She was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabella Milbanke. She had no relationship with her father, who died when she was nine. As a young adult she took an interest in mathematics, and in particular Babbage's work on the analytical engine. Between 1842 and 1843 she translated an article by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea on the engine. She added her own notes on the engine. These notes contain what is considered the first computer program, that is, an algorithm encoded for processing by a machine. Though Babbage's engine was never built, Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers. She realized that computers would be able to do more than just calculating or number-crunching. Others, including Babbage himself, worked only on the possibilities of calculating.

Shreveport is a city in Louisiana. It has a population of 199,311 in 2010. It is the third largest city in Louisiana, after New Orleans and Baton Rouge. It was founded in 1836 where the Red River meets the Texas Trail (now Interstate 20) and US Highway 80. The history of this city it was first adapted by the Caddo.

During the American Civil War, Shreveport was the capital of Louisiana from 1863–1865. The capital moved here after, first, Baton Rouge, and then Opelousas each fell under Union control. The city was a Confederate stronghold throughout the war and was the site of the headquarters of the Trans-Mississippi Department of the Confederate Army. Isolated from events in the east, the Civil War continued in the Trans-Mississippi theater for several weeks after Robert E. Lee's surrender in April 1865, and the Trans-Mississippi was the last Confederate command to surrender, on May 26, 1865. Confederate President Jefferson Davis attempted to flee to Shreveport when he left Richmond but was captured en route in Irwinville, Georgia.

Pinochle

Pinochle (pronounced pea-nukkle) is a card game. It is played with four players on two teams. It can be played with one or two special pinochle decks. A pinochle deck has 48 cards, two each of 9, 10, J, Q, K, and A in each suit. A pinochle game has four hands. The team with the highest score at the end of four hands wins. The first part of a hand is melding. Various combos of cards can be melded. (for example, having two Js of diamonds and two Qs of spades is worth 300 points). The team that bids the highest is allowed to call, the suit that will count higher in melds and take tricks. The second part of a hand is the tricks. Each player throws in a card. The player with the highest trump card, or highest card of the suit led, takes the trick. Each K, 10, or A taken in tricks is worth 10 points.

The Pop Chronicles were two radio documentaries. They told the story of music that was popular in America in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. John Gilliland made both documentaries.

Los Angeles Radio station KRLA 1110 broadcast the first Pop Chronicles documentary in 1969. Dick LaPalm, Lew Irwin, Harry Shearer, Mike Masterson, and Richard Perry interviewed famous musicians. Len Chandler wrote and sang the theme song “The Chronicles of Pop” . The engineer and associate producer was Chester Coleman.

Other radio stations also broadcast the Pop Chronicles, including American Forces Network.

San Francisco radio station KSFO broadcast the "Pop Chronicles of the 1940s" in 1972 and 1976. The American Forces Network also broadcast this show. In 1994, Gilliland released a shorter version on audio cassette. The title of this audiobook was "Pop Chronicles the 40s: The Lively Story of Pop Music in the 40s". 

After his death, Gilliand's sister donated the "Pop Chronicles" tapes to the University of North Texas Music Library. They form The John Gilliland Collection.

<doc id="238556" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238556" title="Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications">
Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications

Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT), known as Digital European Cordless Telephone until 1995, is an ETSI standard for digital portable phones and wireless data transfer. DECT has been standardised as EN 300 175. 

The systems in questions are made of two types of components: One component is connected to the phone network, and usually called "base station". The other component is a mobile handset. To be able to communicate, each handset must be registered with the base station. Once this is done, they are able to communicate and be used as normal "cordless" phones. 

DECT uses a frequency band that is reserved for voice transmissions, called Unlicensed Personal Communications Services. In Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and South America, the frequency band from 1880 MHz to 1900 MMHz is used. In the United States, the band is 1920-1930 MHz.To be sold in the US, only small changes need to be made to DECT equipment. These channels are reserved exclusively for voice communication applications and therefore are less likely to experience interference from other wireless devices such as baby monitors and wireless networks. 

A newer standard that is similar to DECT is called CAT-iq
The DECT standard fully specifies how a portable unit, such as a cordless telephone, can access a fixed network using radio waves. It is different from other standards like GSM in that it does not say how the fixed network is made. The communication with the fixed network is done through a base station which is called "Radio Fixed Part", and terminates the radio waves. The base station then uses a gateway to connect the calls to the fixed network. In most cases, the connection will be to the telephone network. Certain units also allow a connection to newer technologies, such as Voice over IP. Some baby phones also use DECT technology. Such baby phones do not have a gateway.

Many PABX systems installed in offices have a part that is capable of doing DECT. Many system vendors now also offer systems, where communication with voice over IP, or with the classical phone network are possible. In such systems, the communication with the handsets is done using DECT, and the PABX is capable of doing SIP. Some vendors propose WLAN-based solutions to connect the handsets, but this solution is often more complex than using DECT.

DECT has different profiles. A domesic DECT Generic Access Profile (GAP) system typically has the following abilities:

Other interoperability profiles exist in the DECT suite of standards, and in particular the DPRS (DECT Packet Radio Services) bring together a number of prior interoperability profiles for the use of DECT as a wireless LAN and wireless internet access service. With good range (up to 200 m indoors and 6 km using directional antennae outdoors), dedicated spectrum, high interference immunity, open interoperability and data speeds of around 500 kbit/s, DECT appeared at one time to be a superior alternative to Wi-Fi. The protocol capabilities built into the DECT networking protocol standards were particularly good at supporting fast roaming in the public space, between hotspots operated by competing but connected providers. The first DECT product to reach the market, Olivetti's Net, was a wireless LAN, and German firms Dosch & Amand and Hoeft & Wessel built niche businesses on the supply of data transmission systems based on DECT.

However, the timing of the availability of DECT, in the mid 1990s, was too early to find wide application for wireless data outside niche industrial applications. Whilst contemporary providers of Wi-Fi struggled with the same issues, providers of DECT retreated to the more immediately lucrative market for cordless telephones. A key weakness was also the inaccessibility of the U.S. market, due to FCC spectrum restrictions at that time. By the time mass applications for wireless Internet had emerged, and the U.S. had opened up to DECT, well into the new century, the industry had moved far ahead in terms of performance and DECT's time as a wireless data transport was past.

Ironically, the failure of DECT as a data protocol became a strength when DECT 6.0 phones finally appeared in the U.S. in late 2005. By this time, the ISM bands had become crowded in the U.S., especially the 2.4 GHz band which is used by both the most common variants of Wi-Fi, 802.11b and 802.11g, and many cordless phones; thus interference between unlicensed devices has become common in these bands. However, because Wi-Fi does not operate in the UPCS band and DECT devices negotiate with each other for the available spectrum, not only are DECT 6.0 phones immune from this type of interference, their operation does not impair other nearby devices operating on the same frequency, which is a common issue with 2.4 GHz cordless phones.

DECT operates in the 1880-1900 MHz band and defines ten channels from 1881.792 MHz to 1897.344 MHz with a band gap of 1728 kHz. Each base station frame provides 12 duplex speech channel with each time slot occupying any of channel. DECT operates in multicarrier/TDMA/TDD structure. DECT also provides Frequency-hopping spread spectrum over TDMA/TDD structure. If frequency hopping is avoided then each base station can provide up to 120 channels in the DECT spectrum before frequency reuse. Each time slot can be assigned to a different channel in order to exploit advantages of frequency hopping and avoid interference from other users in asynchronous fashion.

Epcot

Epcot (Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow) is part of Disney World in Orlando, Florida. It is split into two parts: Future World and the World Showcase. Future World has many rides and shows about technology, including space travel and how people interact with nature. The World Showcase is split into sections representing eleven countries, sharing the culture of each country there. The symbol of the park is Spaceship Earth, a huge building that looks like a golf ball and has a ride inside.

Walt Disney's original plan for Epcot was for it to be a neighborhood for people to live in with many modern machines aiding their lives. It was going to be called the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, which is where the name EPCOT comes from. Disney died before he could start his plan, and later the new owners of the Walt Disney Company changed the plans into a theme park.

Future World is in the front of the park. Its theme is technology. Spaceship Earth is near the entrance. The ride inside of it is a journey through human methods of communication, from ancient cave paintings up to the Internet and beyond. 

Past Spaceship Earth are many rides and attractions about technology. Innovations is two buildings full of games and shows that use new inventions for making life easier.

There are also two buildings with similar themes: Living with the Land and the Living Seas. Living with the Land has a boat ride inside about the history of farming. It also has a food court that serves food made from the plants grown there. The Living Seas is an aquarium with a ride featuring characters from the movie Finding Nemo. In the aquarium are many kinds of sea creatures, including dolphins, sharks and manatees.

Other rides in Future Word include Test Track, which is about how cars are tested for safety before being sold, and Mission: Space, which is a pretend trip to the planet Mars. Ellen's Energy Adventure stars Ellen DeGeneres and Bill Nye the Science Guy and is about the history of energy, from the time of the dinosaurs up to today's solar power and wind power. Imagination! is about the human imagination.

The World Showcase is split into areas, called pavilions, representing eleven countries. They are in a circle around a big lake called the World Showcase Lagoon. In clockwise order, the pavilions are:
Each pavilion is built to look like the country it represents. They all have restaurants that serve food from their home country. Many of the people working there were born in the country their pavilion represents. 

The Mexico and Norway pavilions have rides. The China, France and Canada pavilions have movies about their countries. The America pavilion has a stage show with audio-animatronic figures about the history of the United States.

Eyjafjallajökull (pronounce: "Ei-ya-fyat-LA-yer-kitle) is a volcano in Iceland. The name means "island-mountains glacier".

The south end of the mountain was once part of the coastline of the Atlantic ocean. The sea gradually moved about 5km south. Now there are beautiful steep cliffs and waterfalls. 

The volcano erupted several times in 1821 and 1822. Some cattle and sheep died, presumably because of fluoride poisoning.

Around Christmas 2009 the volcano started to show signs of being active again. On 27 March 2010 it started to erupt. On 14 April 2010 Eyjafjallajökull started to erupt heavily from the top crater in the centre of the glacier. This made meltwater floods to rush down the nearby rivers. 800 people had to be evacuated. Volcanic ash was thrown several kilometres into the atmosphere. The dust blow over northwest Europe on the 15th and 16th April 2010. It became very dangerous for aeroplanes to fly and so all commercial flights were stopped in most parts of northern Europe. This caused chaos for travellers, many of whom were trying to return home after their Easter vacation.

Italian conquest of British Somaliland

Italian conquest of British Somaliland was an Italian campaign during WWII against the British Empire . It was the only Italian victory against the Allies, without help from Germany.

When Italy declared war in May 1940, the Italian troops were not prepared for a prolonged war in Eastern Africa. As a consequence, Mussolini ordered only some limited aggressive actions to capture territory along the borders of Kenya, Egypt and Sudan. 

In June 1940 Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, the Governor-General of "Italian East Africa", convinced the Italian Supreme Command ("Commando Supremo") to plan a campaign to conquer a British colony: British Somaliland. The King of Italy Victor Emmanuel III and Mussolini agreed and at the beginning of August the campaign was ready to start.

The Italian force attacking British Somaliland in August 1940 was commanded by General Guglielmo Nasi and included five colonial brigades, three "Blackshirt" battalions, and three bands ("bande") of native troops. The Italians had armoured vehicles (a small number of both L3/35 light and M11/39 medium tanks), artillery, and, most important, superior air support. The Italians numbered about 24,000.

The Italians were opposed by a British contingent of about 4,000 soldiers consisting of the "Somaliland Camel Corps" (commanded by Colonel Arthur Reginald Chater), elements of the 2nd (Nyasaland) Battalion "King's African Rifles" (KAR) and the 1st Battalion Northern Rhodesian Regiment, the 3rd Battalion 15th Punjab Regiment, and the "2nd Battalion, Black Watch".

In the early hours of 3 August 1940 the Italian army crossed the border between Italian East Africa (called by the Italians "Africa Orientale Italiana") and British Somaliland.

The Italians attacked with military columns in three directions: to the north toward the port of Zeila, to the center toward Adadlek and to the south toward Odweina. 

On 5 August the port of Zeila was occupied after heavy fighting and every possibility of help from French Somaliland for the retreating British was cut. The northern Italian column then proceeded south along the coast and occupied the village of Bulhar.

The Italian central column, commanded by Lieutenant-General Carlo De Simone faced more difficulties because of the mountainous terrain and was stopped by the English at the Karrin Pass, before Hargeisa. 

Colonel Arthur Reginald Chater, used his camel corps to skirmish with and screen against the advancing Italians as the other British and Commonwealth forces pulled back towards Tug Argan.

On 6 August within three days of the invasion, the towns of Zeila and Hargeisa were taken by the Italians. Odweina fell the following day and the Italian central and eastern columns combined to launch attacks against the main British and Commonwealth positions at Tug Argan. 

On 7 August the British and Commonwealth forces in British Somaliland received reinforcements with the arrival of the 1st Battalion "2nd Punjab Regiment". On 11 August, a new commander, Major-General Alfred Godwin-Austen, reached Tug Argan. 

The defensive positions of the British army were centered around six hills overlooking the only road toward Berbera. 
On 11 August an Italian brigade commanded by De Simone attacked the hill defended by the 3rd Battalion 15th Punjab Regiment and captured it with heavy casualties. The British launched two unsuccessful counterattacks but the next day were forced to abandon two other nearby hills.

On 14 August the Italians began to encircle the British defenders from their eastern positions, and the defenders' situation started to look critical.

After three days of battle, early on 15 August Godwin-Austen (fearing an imminent encirclement) concluded that further resistance at Tug Argan would be futile. He contacted the British Middle East Command headquarters in Cairo, Egypt and requested and received permission to withdraw his forces from British Somaliland. 

The determined effort of the "Black Watch" battalion, which covered the retreat, allowed the entire British and Commonwealth contingent to withdraw to Berbera with minimal losses. 

Whilst the British made their fighting retreat to Berbera, the British Royal Navy had constructed an all-tide jetty and had commenced evacuating civilian and administrative officials. The two main Italian columns (the central and the southern) were united at the village of La Farruk, approximately 30 km south of Berbera.

From Bulhar the third Italian column reached the area of Berbera on 14 August but the British defenders were able to hold them off. On 16 August they started to embark troops onto the waiting ships and had completed the evacuation by the afternoon of the following day, departing for Aden in the Arabian peninsula. They had little interference in this operation as a result of a fierce bayonet charge against the Italians by the Black Watch at Barkasan The Somaliland Camel Corps, rather than evacuate, was disbanded and dispersed.

On 19 August the Italians took control of Berbera and then moved down the coast to complete their conquest of British Somaliland. The British colony was annexed by Mussolini to the "Italian Empire" in Italian East Africa.

According to Italian historians , during the campaign to conquer British Somaliland the casualties were 250 for the British army and 205 for the Italian. 

But according to the British account of events total British casualties were 158 and Italian losses were estimated at between ten and twenty times higher.

This campaign in Somaliland was like all the others of the Axis: it initially started with a victory, then after a period of time (like the campaigns in the Balkans, in the Philippines or in Russia), finished with a complete defeat. But in the specific case of the Italian conquest of British Somaliland, the defeat (that happened in spring 1941) was followed by nearly two years of Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia. 

British Somaliland remained part of the Italian East Africa until March 1941 when the 1st/2nd Punjab Regiment and the 3rd/15th Punjab Regiment returned from Aden to re-occupy the territory.

Scope of genetic engineering

GENETIC
Genetic Engineering
Genetic engineering or genetic modification refers to the process of manipulating the characteristics and functions of the original genes of an organism. The objective of this process is to introduce new physiological and physical features or characteristics.
A gene is a basic constituent unit of any organism. It is a locatable region of a genome which contains the whole hereditary information of the organism. A gene corresponds to a unit of inheritance. It is a segment of the DNA which determines the special features or functions of the organism.
Genetic engineering meddles with the organism’s natural reproductive process, whether sexual or asexual. It gives it a new direction which is different from its natural disposition and development. The process involves the isolation and manipulation of the genes by introducing the new DNA into the cells. DNA is a blue print of the individual characteristics of an organism. The information stored in the DNA controls the management of biochemical process of each organism. The life, development and unique characteristics of the organism depend upon on its own DNA. 
The aims of the study, development and practice of genetic engineering are noble and beneficial for mankind. Genetic engineering may help make crops resistant to herbicides used to kill the unwanted plants and weeds which obstruct their full growth. Though some herbicides are selective and kill only the specifically targeted unwanted plants, there are others which are non selective and besides killing the useless and obstructive weeds, kill any plants they come in contact thus killing the plants which are sought to be protected. 
The domain of genetic engineering can extend from plants to cover both the animal and human life. It can, for example, hybridize the production of the animals and promote the growth of healthy species of milk producing animals, stronger and healthier horses, cows and bullocks which can better withstand the wear and tear of life.
Recreation of vital human organs to replace the sick and missing ones is another example of how genetic engineering can prove beneficial to human beings. 
The possibilities of the scope of genetic engineering are limitless and the horizon is widening with every day of research. Genetic engineering like many other branches of science, for example, nuclear science, can be used nobly and ignobly.
The human genome project to categorize all the genes in the human species is a remarkable effort to determine the complete structure of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the human genetic material, and understand its functions. This research in human genetics aims at determining why the human being resemble or differ from each other.
On the other hand, genetic engineering can also be misused by mutilating the beautiful creation of God by launching, for example, Nazi style schemes for population control or produce a biological devastation through bungling with man made viruses. Cloning is one such example how genetic engineering can be beneficial as well as detrimental.
Molecular biologists have discovered numerous enzymes which can alter the structure of the DNA in living organisms. Using them the scientists can cut the specific genes from the DNA and build customized DNA. With this knowledge they can alter the genes of living organisms. 
For example the biological engineers have been able to change the growth patterns of tomatoes. Tomatoes are sensitive to frost that shortens their life span. Fish on the other hand thrive in the cold and chilly water. Scientists found out the gene in fish that resists the cold and transferred it to tomatoes thereby immunizing them against the frosty cold and prolonging their growing season. There are innumerable such projects that are creating new strains in the agricultural areas which have great economic potential. 
Genetic engineering can boost the growth and yield of a variety food crops--pulses and cereals-- and alleviate the problems of food shortage and mitigate the suffering of the starving millions across the world.

<doc id="238661" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238661" title="Shen Bao">
Shen Bao

Shen Bao (Chinese: 申報; Pinyin: Shēn Bào) was a newspaper published in Shanghai, China. It was published between April 30, 1872 and May 27, 1949, making it the longest running for any newspaper in China. The name has also been transliterated as Shun Pao or Shen-pao. In English, the newspaper was usually called Shanghai News. The name is short for "Shenjiang Xinbao". Shenjiang is a short form of Chunsheng jiang, the old name for the Huangpu River. 

The paper was started by Ernest Major (1841-1908), in 1872. Major was a British businessman. "Shen Bao" was one of the first modern Chinese newspapers. Major returned to England in 1899, and the newspaper was reorganised to be Major Company Limited. According to Zhou, Major was different from other foreign newspapers in two areas: From the start, he made it clear, that the newspaper would be for Chinese readers, and not for foreigners. He therefore picked those news and issues that would be interesting to Chinese. Secondly, he made Chinese compradors responsible for running the business and he had Chinese editors select the news and write the editorials. He was very successful: The Chinese compradors used their ties with the community, raised the circulation, and obtained advertisements. This made the paper cheaper than those of the competition. The Chinese editors knew what their readers wanted to read about. 

"Shen Bao" played an important role and helped form public opinion at the end of the 19th century. The paper ran a campaign against hiring young women as waitresses in opium dens. According to the campaign, this made it difficult to distinguish between what could be tolerated, and what could not, because it implicitly said these women would also provide sex services in the dens. Most of the dens with this practice were in the French Concession. The campaign said that one of the reasons this problem existed was that there were foreigners in Shanghai. There was an uproar, and the practice was banned; in reality little was done to eradicate it, though. 

The newspaper was innovative: It used new printing technologies, sent a military correspondent to cover the Sino-French War in Vietnam in 1884 and used vernacular ("baihua")" Quickly it got the reputation of being one of the best newspapers in China. It was bought by a Chinese in 1909. In the early 20th century it had a circulation of 30.000 copies a day. 9.000 of them in Shanhai, and the rest was for other parts of China. "By the early 1920s its circulation was 50,000; by the end of the decade 100,000; and by the mid 1930s, 150,000."

The paper's offices were in the International Settlement, "about a block away from the Central Police Station." At first, the paper had eight pages, with news, essays, and advertisements as well as imperial decrees and memorials. "Because the editorial policies followed the principle of 'reporting whatever possible and letting the readers determine the truth,' many interesting but unfounded rumors were often included as news." After 1905, it increased its size to twenty pages. 

Shen Bao was founded as a commercial newspaper. Politically, it was conservative for the first three decades and supported the Qing government. In 1905, it started to change its orientation: On New Year's Day it quoted Liang Qichao's constitutionalist slogans. In 1907, the paper was sold to Xi Zipei (1867-1929), Xi Zipei used to be a comprador
of the paper. Xi Zipei was influenced by Zhang Jian. The paper changed and became quite liberal and strongly supported the constitutional movement. "It had the following sections: editorials, international news, domestical news, local news, industry and trade, law and society, sports and education, literature and art, and advertisements. In addition to reporting important political news stories, it had many special columns and supplements such as "ziyou tan" (free discussion), automobile, education and life." In 1912 control was transferred to Shi Liangcai. "In the 1930s, Shi was a strong supporter of the Human Rights Defence Alliance established by Madam Soong Qing Ling.Soong Qing Ling was the second wife of revolutionary leader Dr Sun Yat-sen, with Cai Yuanpei and Lu Xun."

In 1934, the newspaper made the government angry, because it had a strong attitude against the Japanese. "On November 13, Shih Liang-ts'ai, its owner and editor-in-chief, was mysteriously assassinated on the Shanghai-Hangchow Highway"; responsibility for his murder has been laid at the feet of the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, Chiang Kai-shek's much-feared secret police. In 1938, with the city under Japanese control, Norwood Francis Allman (1893-1987), an American lawyer who had been U.S. Consul in Shanghai in the early 1920s, was asked by the paper's Chinese owners to take over as editor; "Time" wrote in 1940: "A fluent Chinese linguist, Allman reads every story that goes into Shun Pao, writes editorials, corrects editorials written by staff members. He serves without pay." The paper was on bad terms with the Japanese, and in 1940 a Chinese assistant editor was killed and his head left on the street as a warning to journalists. During World War II the paper passed into the hands of collaborators with the Japanese occupation, but after the war Pan Gongzhan, an influential Kuomintang party official who had been an editor on the paper in the late 1920s, became its publisher and Chen Shunyü its chief editor. In May 1949, the People's Liberation Army took Shanghai and shut down the newspaper was.

There is a complete collection of the paper's issues in the Shanghai Library.

Evacuation

Evacuation is a term that comes from Latin language. Literally, it means "emptying". Most of the time it means that people leave an area or a zone because of an imminent danger or threat. Evacuations are planned, and people should leave the zone of danger according to the plan. The causes for evacuations can be natural disasters such as flooding or volcano eruptions, or they can be man-made ones, like a bomb in a building, a fire on a train in a tunnel or an industrial accident.

French defence

The French defence is a chess opening, one of the asymmetric replies to 1.e4, namely 1...e6. It is the third most popular reply to 1.e4. Often, Black plays more actively on the queenside while White plays more actively on the kingside. 

A problem that Black often has in the French defence is finding a way for his light squared bishop to become active. Although this is true, it may not matter if Black knows what he is doing. The defence has a reputation for reliability, and has been played by many great players (such as Botvinnik), and has featured in several world championship matches. 

Typical examples go: 

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2 c5 (3...Nf6 is popular) 4.exd5 exd5 5.Nf3 Nc6 6.Bb5 Bd6 7.dxc5 Bxc5 8.0-0 Ne7 and so on. This line is quiet, and mostly about the centre.

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Ne7 7.Qg4 Qc7 (7...0-0 is possible) 8.Qxg7 Rg8 9.Qxh7 cxd4 10.Ne2 and so on. The play in lines like this is strongly asymmetric: White owns the kingside, and Black owns the queenside.

The Nimzo-Indian defence is a popular chess opening with these initial moves: 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4. The basic idea is for Black to challenge for control of the central square e4. This comes at the cost of exchanging his Bb4 for the white Nc3 when White plays a3. The opening is named after Aaron Nimzovich, who developed and promoted it. Initially a hypermodern opening, it usually transposes (changes) into classical form, as black occupies central squares by ...c5 and ...d5.

The white central pawns are under restraint. Much preparation is needed before they can move forward.

The pound-force or simply pound (abbreviations: lb, lb, or lbf) is a unit of force. 
The pound-force is about equal to the gravitational force applied on a mass of one pound on the surface of Earth. Since the 18th century, the unit has been used in low-precision measurements.
In the 20th century, people needed a more precise definition. An official value for acceleration due to gravity was needed. Today, as decided by the General Conference on Weights and Measures, standard gravity is usually taken to be 9.80665 m/s (about 32.17405 ft/s)

Long ton (weight ton or imperial ton) is the name for the unit called the "ton" in the avoirdupois or Imperial system of measurements, as used in the United Kingdom and several other Commonwealth countries. It has been mostly replaced by the tonne, and in the United States by the short ton. It is equal to or of salt water with a density of 64 lb/ft (1.025 g/ml). It has some limited use in the United States, most commonly in measuring the displacement of ships, and was the unit recommended for warships by international agreements between the world wars, for example battleships were limited to 35,000 long tons.

Seismogram

A seismogram is a record of an earthquake induced motion at a measuring station as a function of time. Seismograms are usually taken by "seismometers". "Seisometers" record motions in three cartesian axes (x, y, and z), with the z axis perpendicular to the Earth's surface and the x- and y- axes parallel to the surface.

Historically, seismograms were recorded on paper attached to rotating drums. Some used pens on ordinary paper. Others used light beams to expose "photosensitive paper". Today, almost all seismograms are recorded digitally to make analysis by computer easier. Seismograms are very important for measuring earthquakes using the Richter scale.

Nothosaurs were long-necked, long-tailed, fish-eating sauropterygian reptiles ranging from a few inches to 20 feet (6 m) long - they were not dinosaurs. Nothosaurs lived during the Triassic period. They may have evolved into the plesiosaurs. These reptiles had a long, thin head with many sharp teeth; the front teeth were longer than the back teeth. The nostrils were on the top end of the snout. They breathed air but spent most of the time in the water.

William Hodgson "Hod" Stuart (February 20, 1879 – June 23, 1907) was a Canadian professional ice hockey point (now called a defenceman) who played nine seasons for many teams in different leagues. He also played for a short time with the Ottawa Rough Riders football team. With his brother Bruce, Stuart played in the first professional ice hockey league, the International Professional Hockey League. In 1907 Stuart, thought of as the finest defender of the era, helped the Montreal Wanderers win the Stanley Cup, the trophy for best hockey team. A few months after winning the Cup, he died in a diving accident. The Wanderers hosted a all-star game to raise money for his family, the first time ever that an all-star game was played. When the Hockey Hall of Fame was created in 1945, Stuart was one of the first twelve players put in the Hall; his brother Bruce would also be elected into the Hall of Fame in 1961.

ZIP codes are numbered with the first number representing a certain group of U.S. states. The second and third numbers represent a region in that group of states or, in some cases, a large city. The fourth and fifth numbers representing a group of delivery addresses within that region. The main town in a region (if applicable) often gets the first ZIP codes for that region. Other towns are often given ZIP codes in numerical order, usually alphabetically. Often, the biggest city in a prefix is given a zip code ending in 01.

The first digit of the ZIP code is used as follows:

Opium poppy

Opium poppy, Papaver somniferum var. album, is a species of plant. Opium and poppy seeds can be taken from them. A great number of opiates, for example, morphine, thebaine, codeine, papaverine, and noscapine, are made from opium. The Latin name means the "sleep-bringing poppy, white form". Some of these opiates make people feel sleepy.

The poppy is the only species of Papaveraceae that is an agricultural crop grown so much. Other species, "Papaver rhoeas" and "Papaver argemone", are important agricultural weeds. They may be wrongly thought of as the crop.

The plant itself is also used as a decoration. It has been known as the "common garden poppy". It is widely grown as an ornamental flower in Europe, North America, South America, and Asia.

Poppy seeds of "Papaver somniferum" are important as food. It is where poppyseed oil, a healthy, useful oil, comes from. It is also where poppy seeds come from. The seeds have very little . The oil that comes from them has even less.

Opium Wars

The Opium Wars (1839–42 and 1856–60) were two wars between China and Western countries. The first was between Great Britain and China. The Second Opium War was from 1856 to 1860. The Second Opium War was also known as the "Arrow War" or "Anglo-French War" in China. Early in the 19th century, British merchants began secretly taking opium into China. They wanted to balance their purchases of tea for export to Britain. In 1839, China said that opium was not allowed. They destroyed at Guangzhou (Canton) much opium that they had taken from British merchants. Great Britian sent gunboats to attack Chinese coastal cities. China was not developed in modern weapons. They were defeated. China was forced to sign the Treaty of Nanjing (1842) and the British Supplementary Treaty of the Bogue (1843).

The wars were about many other things than opium. They were also about opening China to European and American trade and colonizations. 

The British merchants began selling opium to China. At that time, opium was growing in India. Opium is an addictive drug. It is sometimes used to treat disease. However, opium can also be used as a drug that changes the user's state of mind. Usually this makes the user feel, for a short time, that they are happy and peaceful. Opium had been used in China for a long time before the British came, mostly to treat disease. When the British began importing large amounts of the drug, Chinese began using opium for its mind-changing effect. More and more people grew addicted to opium. So, the British were able to import more and more opium. By selling this drug, the British slowly began to make more money on their exports to China than they spent on their imports of Chinese goods. British exports of opium to China increased greatly. They went from an estimated 15 tons in 1730, to 75 tons in 1773. Opium was shipped in over two thousand "chests". Every chest had 140 pounds (67 kilograms) of opium inside.
Opium is a naturally occurring substance found in the seeds of the opium poppy. Opium, which contains morphine, is extracted from the poppy seeds and used to produce heroin. 
Heroin is an illegal, highly addictive drug and its use is a serious problem in America. It is both the most abused and the most rapidly acting of the opiates.

Seismometer or seismograph is an instrument that measures motions of the ground, including those generated by earthquakes, nuclear explosions, and other sources. Records of seismic waves called seismograms allow to map the interior of the Earth, and locate and measure the size of those different sources.

The word derives from the Greek σεισμός, "seismós", a shaking or quake, from the verb σείω, "seíō", to shake; and μέτρον, "métron", measure.

Renowned artist Tone (仲維軍) formed his own band after releasing his first debut album titled "我的6:57am", and recruited the other two members to form Cool Silly. They are well known throughout Taiwan with their hit "Fly" (我飛), which was the theme song for the 2010 Taipei International Flora Exposition(臺北國際花卉博覽會). The song attracted many fans, which led to Cool Silly's debut in 2010 with the release of their first digital album, Cool Silly: The Prelude. Since their debut, they have often been compared with the Popular Taiwanese rock group, F.I.R., because of the similar formation of band members and attractive performance personalities.

The name Cool Silly comes from the band's ideology that "a person can't be cool unless they're silly as well". The band insists that the personality of their music is not only "cool" but "silly" as well.

Dew

Dew is a thin film of water that has condensed on the surface of objects near the ground in the morning or evening. These objects cool in the night. When they cool, the thin layer of air around them cools too. This makes some water vapor condense on the object. The condensation happens because the air is able to hold less water when it is cooled. The temperature when condensation begins is called the "dew point". If the dew point temperature becomes lower than 32 °F (0 °C), the dew turns into frost. Most people agree that the water in the dew comes from the atmosphere. However, some studies suggest that it also comes up through the soil and then condenses on the ground. This happens, though, only when conditions are right.

Dew forms best when the atmosphere is clean, the air is calm, and there is not much wind. It does not always form in the night and outdoors, though. They also work when eyeglasses get steamy in warm, wet rooms. Dew may also happen in industrial processes. However, people use the word condensation more often than dew.

In the Old Testament dew is used as a symbol. Deuteronomy 32:3 says: "...my speech shall as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass." ()

Jazz piano

Jazz piano is a word for the ways pianists play jazz. The piano has been an important part of the jazz, in both solo and group settings. Its role is one of the biggest. This is because of the instrument's combined melodic and harmonic nature. For this reason it is also an important tool in the understanding of jazz theory and arranging for jazz musicians and composers. Together with the guitar, vibraphone, and other keyboard instruments, the piano is one of the few instruments in a jazz combo which can play chords, instead of only single notes (as with the saxophone or trumpet).

Wikipedia:Very good articles/Epping Ongar Railway

The Epping Ongar Railway is a preserved railway. It runs along the last section of the old Great Eastern Railway and London Underground Central line branch line. The line runs between Epping and Ongar. There is also an intermediate stop at North Weald. The line was reopened in late 2004 after 10 years of being closed. It runs a Sunday and Bank Holiday service using a Class 117 diesel multiple unit. The service runs between Ongar and Coopersale. The service is provided by volunteers who take care for the line as well as run the trains. The land and infrastructure are owned by Epping Ongar Railway Ltd.

The branch line to Ongar was built in 1865 by the Eastern Counties/Great Eastern Railway. The eastern section of the line, between Epping and Ongar, was single track. There was one passing loop at North Weald station. Around 14 trains went as far as Ongar station each day. The rest finished at Epping or Loughton. The trains continued to finish at Epping or Loughton until 1949. At this time the London Passenger Transport Board's New Works project extended the Central line to Epping using electric trains. The Central Line would take over the railway from British Rail. As part of this change, the Epping-Ongar branch line had its through trains to London removed. Instead, a shuttle service between Epping (to connect with trains to London) and Ongar was used.

2 Maccabees

2 Maccabees is a sacred book of the Bible which focuses on the Jews' revolt against Antiochus IV Epiphanes and ends with the defeat of the Syrian general Nicanor in 161 BC by Judas Maccabeus, the hero of the work. 

2 Maccabees was written in Koine Greek, probably in Alexandria, Egypt, "c" 124 BC. It gives a revised version of the historical events recounted in the first seven chapters of 1 Maccabees.

3 Maccabees

The book of the 3 Maccabees is found in most Orthodox Bibles.
However, the book actually has nothing to do with the Maccabees. It does not have anything to do with their revolt against the Seleucid Empire, either (as described in 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees). Instead, it tells the story of persecution of the Jews under Ptolemy IV Philopator (222-205 BC). The name of the book seems to come from the similarities between this book and the stories of the martyrdom of Eleazar and the Maccabeean youths in 2 Maccabees. The High Priest Shimon is also mentioned.

Lincoln Park Zoo

Lincoln Park Zoo is a free zoo. It is in Lincoln Park neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois. The zoo was founded in 1868. This was when the Lincoln Park Commissioners were given a gift of a pair of swans. In 1874, the swans were joined by a bear cub. This was the first animal bought for the zoo. The bear became quite good at escaping from its home. It could often be found wandering around Lincoln Park at night. The first bison ever born in captivity was born in Lincoln Park. Marlin Perkins, who later gained fame as the host of the television program "Wild Kingdom", was director of the zoo from 1944 until 1962. Now, Lincoln Park Zoo is home to a wide variety of animals. The zoo includes polar bears, penguins, gorillas, reptiles, monkeys, and other species totalling nearly 1,250 animals. Also located in Lincoln Park Zoo is a burr oak tree which dates to 1830, three years before the city was founded. Lincoln Park Zoo is one of four zoos in the Chicago area, the others being the large Brookfield Zoo, and the minor Phillips Park Zoo, and Cosley Zoo. Lincoln Park Zoo is the only one within the Chicago city limits.

Two sections of Lincoln Park Zoo have been set aside for children. The first is the Pritzker Family Children's Zoo. The Children's Zoo contains an indoor structure for children to play in. People used to be able to pet animals at the Children's Zoo, but in recent years, due to health concerns, Lincoln Park Zoo has stopped this at the Children's Zoo. Also, baby animals who are rejected by their parents are no longer kept in the Children's Zoo because the zoo has found that it is harder to reintroduce them into their habitats once they grow up if they are kept away from their own species. The second area of the zoo for children in the Farm-in-the-Zoo, presented by John Deere. This small farm contains pigs, cows, horses and other animals which can be found on farms. Children can feed and pet the animals. In addition, the cows are milked in public for children to see. Regenstein Center for African Apes is home to Keo, the oldest male chimpanzee in a North American zoo.

Near the southern end of Lincoln Park Zoo, one can rent a paddle boat for a spin around the Lincoln Park Lagoon. The Lagoon is surrounded by trees and offers a relaxing time (and, of course, paddling exercise). Kayakers and canoers also take to the lagoon and one can often see scullers as well.

Modern defence

The Modern defence is a chess opening. It is almost the only defence which can be played against any opening move; and it may be played as an opening move itself. It consists in the immediate fianchetto of the king's bishop (KB). The first moves might be:
The opening is hypermodern. Black does not occupy the centre, he counter-attacks the centre built up by his opponent. He will probably play ...d6 next, then develop his K-side, then perhaps counter-attack the white centre with ...c5. The system is extremely flexible, and there are many transpositions. There are players, including a few grandmasters, who play almost nothing but the Modern with white and black.

Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy

The Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy is awarded every year to the National Hockey League player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to ice hockey. The winner is selected by a vote of the "Professional Hockey Writers' Association" after each team selects one player on their team to be voted on. It is often awarded to a player who has come back from career- or even life-threatening illness or injury. A player can receive this trophy only once in his career.

The trophy is named in honour of Bill Masterton, a Minnesota North Stars player who died on January 15, 1968, after sustaining an injury during a hockey game. During his playing career, Masterton showed "to a high degree the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey". It was first awarded following the 1967–68 regular season. As of the end of the 2008–09 NHL season, players for the Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers and Boston Bruins have won the trophy 4 times each, while the Los Angeles Kings have won 3 times.

The Advocate Newspaper

The Advocate Newspaper is a newspaper that is printed in North West Tasmania. Tasmania is a state of Australia. Its readership includes North West Tasmanian towns such as Burnie, Ulverstone, Devonport, Penguin, Wynyard, Latrobe and Smithton. It is currently owned by Fairfax Media.

On Wednesday October 1, 1890 Robert Harris and his sons, Robert and Charles, printed the first issue of The Wellington Times. This was Burnie’s first newspaper. Burnie is a major town in North West Tasmania.

The Wellington Times was named after the county in which Burnie and Emu Bay were located and was first published only on Wednesdays and Saturdays. There was about 2000 copies printed.

The original Burnie Wellington Times office in 1890 stood on a site in Cattley Street and employed a staff of 10. In 1892 The Wellington Times was printed 3 times a week, appearing on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. On November 2, 1897, the name was changed to The Emu Bay Times.

The success of the newspaper encouraged the owners to grow operations to Devonport and on January 4, 1899 the The North Western Advocate and Agricultural and a Mining Gazette was produced.

The separate publication of the two newspapers lasted only 11 months by which time the Government Railway had reached Burnie and on November 13, 1899 the two newspapers were joined to become a daily newspaper called The North Western Advocate and The Emu Bay Times.

In 1902, a new building had been built in Mount Street, Burnie, at the present (2010) site and the staff had increased to 26. In the last decade of the 19th century, the North-West and West Coast were served by a number of daily newspapers - but by 1920 The Advocate was the sole survivor.

In the 1950s The Advocate was one of the first daily newspapers in Australia to use colour in advertisements and in 1968 it was the first daily newspaper in Australia to be printed on a Web-Offset press. Over the three years from 1993 to 1996, The Advocate began a technology development programme that resulted in computer based full-page negative output on October 1, 1996.

In 2004, The Advocate became the third largest regional daily newspaper of Rural Press thereby ending the involvement of the Harris family for the first time since it began.

In 2008, Rural Press became part of Fairfax Media, one of Australia’s largest media businesses with The Advocate the only daily newspaper covering all areas of North West and Western Tasmania.

Agustín Ross Park

The Agustín Ross Park is a park located in the Agustín Ross Avenue, in front of the old Ross Casino, in Pichilemu. It is a National Monument of Chile.

The original park boasts 100-year-old native Chilean palms ("Phoenix canariensis") and many green spaces, and its recent restoration has made it into an attractive walking destination. The majority of the grand houses in the park are in use as private homes.

Both the park and the former casino were named National Monuments on February 25, 1988.

The Park was severely damaged after the 2010 Pichilemu earthquake, destroying all the balaustrades around the park.

Suffer (album)

Suffer is the third album by American punk rock band Bad Religion, released on the Californian independent record label Epitaph Records on September 8, 1988. It was the first album that was both released and distributed by the label. Following the release of the EP "Back to the Known" (1985), Bad Religion went on a temporary hiatus, then reunited with its original members and went to work on its first full-length studio album in five years.

Like the next Bad Religion album "No Control" (1989), many people consider "Suffer" to be one of the best punk albums of the 1980s. The album became Epitaph's best-selling album for a number of years, until the release of The Offspring's popular "Smash" album in 1994. A plethora of third-wave punk bands cite this album as a major inspiration; NOFX's Fat Mike has called it "the record that changed everything."

The album cover features a drawing of a teenager on fire wearing a t-shirt of Bad Religion's crossbuster logo, designed by Jerry Mahoney. The person on the cover has been taken by the band as a mascot, "Boy on Fire" is the name and can also be seen on Bad Religion accessories, including t-shirts. The cover art was also parodied for NOFX's "Surfer" EP, which depicted a surfer on fire.

No Control

No Control is the fourth album by American punk rock band Bad Religion, released on the Californian independent record label Epitaph Records on November 2, 1989. It was the follow-up to the band's highly acclaimed reunion album "Suffer".

Like the previous Bad Religion album, many people consider "No Control" to be one of the best punk albums of the 1980s, while some consider it to be the band's finest effort, featuring "Change of Ideas", "No Control", "I Want to Conquer the World", "Big Bang" and "You", all of which are staples of their live show to this day.

Stylistically, "No Control" is a faster album than its predecessor, owing more to hardcore punk.

Stranger Than Fiction

Stranger Than Fiction is the eighth album by American punk rock band Bad Religion, released in 1994. This was their first album released on the major label Atlantic Records (however Atlantic did re-release their previous album, "Recipe for Hate") and also its last release with guitarist Brett Gurewitz, who left just prior to the 1994-1995 world tour, but returned to the band seven years later. On tour, Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker, who would stay with the band permanently.

Because of sales continuing sixteen years after its release, many consider "Stranger Than Fiction" to be one of Bad Religion's most successful albums, featuring two of their famous hits, "Infected" and the re-recorded version of "21st Century (Digital Boy)", which both earned airplay on MTV and radio stations, such as KROQ. The latter single was originally recorded in 1990 on their fifth album "Against the Grain". The album included two more , "Stranger Than Fiction" and "Incomplete", which failed to make any national chart.

As of 2010, "Stranger Than Fiction" remains the only Bad Religion record to get gold status in the United States.

Battle of the Alamo

The Battle of the Alamo took place in 1836 at the Alamo in what is now San Antonio, Texas, United States. At the time, Texas belonged to Mexico, but many people in Texas wanted it to leave Mexico and become a new country. Over 100 of these people, including former Congressman Davy Crockett, were in the Alamo, which was a mission (which is like a church) when a Mexican army of several thousand, led by General Antonio López de Santa Anna, showed up and surrounded the Alamo. For 12 days, the Mexican army surrounded the Alamo, then it attacked on March 6, 1836. All 187 of the men from Texas were killed.Jim Bowie also died at the Battle of the Alamo.

Adrian Edmondson

Adrian Edmonson (24 January 1957) is in English actor and comedian. He is best known for his roles as Vyvyan Basterd in TV series The Young Ones and Eddie Hitler in Bottom.

Edmonson was born in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire. He is married to comedienne Jennifer Saunders; the couple have three daughters.

Played by Adrian Edmondson, Vyvyan is a psychotic punk metal medical student. He has orange-dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars seemingly embedded into his forehead. In the episode "Interesting", he drinks a pint of blue liquid which makes his hair fall out and the number 666 is visible on the side of his head. He is extremely violent and regularly attacks Neil and Rick with pieces of wood, cricket bats and other large objects. He never harms Mike, whom he respects, and often addresses as "Michael". He despises Rick more than he does Neil - when Rick, Mike and Neil meet his mother at a bar in the episode "Boring", he calls both Neil and Mike his friends, but not Rick, whom he refers to as "a complete bastard." Ironically, this antagonistic relationship between Rick and Vyvyan makes them virtually inseparable, as the two spend by far more time together than with the other housemates. Unlike Neil and Rick, Vyvyan appears to come from a working class background (something Rick incorrectly believes himself to have).

Vyvyan owns a Glaswegian hamster named Special Patrol Group ("SPG" for short) whom he is very fond of, although SPG is also frequently subjected to Vyvyan's extreme violence, although it is usually provoked, such as when SPG bit Vyvyan in "Flood" or plugging in the TV after Vyvyan swallowed it in "Bomb". His mother is a barmaid and former shoplifter, who before "Boring" had not seen Vyvyan in ten years and has no idea who his father is.

Vyvyan occasionally displays feats of superhuman strength (surviving a pickaxe through his head, moving entire walls with his bare hands, lifting Neil above his head in a fight with Rick, biting through a brick and even being decapitated and re-attaching his own head) and eats just about anything: televisions, dead rats, caviar and cornflakes with ketchup.

In "Bambi" Vyvyan displays impressive mathematical talent (working out instantly that he has worn his three pairs of knickers 269 times each since their last wash), yet also that he cannot tell the time, although he was earlier able to point out that it was midnight without any difficulty.

In the episode "Flood", he develops a potion to transform a person into an axe-wielding homicidal maniac (he claims "it's basically a cure... for not being an axe-wielding homicidal maniac... the potential market's enormous!"). He has more friends than the others but apparently "he doesn't like any of them." He frequently causes havoc or damage such as wiring the doorbell to a bomb to "pep it up a bit" and adding a small car engine to the vacuum cleaner as previously it "looked a bit on the tentative side" - which then proceeds to suck up the carpet, the floorboards and a friend of Neil's (the vacuum also prompted one of the few clashes between Vyvyan and Mike; when Mike admonished Vyv not to use it anymore, Vyv replied by calling him a "poof").

Vyvyan is the only member of the group to own a car - a yellow Ford Anglia with red flames painted along the sides, although he is not the only house member who can drive - during Summer Holiday Rick is briefly seen driving the stolen double decker bus.

Eugen Sandow

Eugen Sandow (April 2, 1867 – October 14, 1925), born Friedrich Wilhelm Müller, was a Prussian who pioneered bodybuilding in 19th century and was often referred to as the "Father of Modern Bodybuilding".

Sandow's resemblance to the physiques found on classical Greek and Roman sculpture was no accident, as he measured the statues in museums and helped to develop "The Grecian Ideal" as a formula for the "perfect physique." Sandow built his physique to the exact proportions of his Grecian Ideal, and is considered the 'father of modern bodybuilding, as one of the first athletes to intentionally develop his musculature to pre-determined dimensions. In his books "Strength and How to Obtain It" and "Sandow's System of Physical Training", Sandow laid out specific prescriptions of weights and repetitions in order to achieve his ideal proportions.

Fault (geology)

A fault is a fracture, or break, in the Earth's crust (lithosphere). This is where sections of rock move past each other.

Faulting occurs when shear stress on a rock overcomes the forces which hold it together. The fracture itself is called a "fault plane". When it is exposed at the Earth's surface, it may form a cliff or steep slope called a "fault scarp".

The angle between the fault plane and an imaginary horizontal plane is called the "dip angle" of the fault. Faults may dip shallowly or steeply.

Faults are categorized into three types:

Darts

Darts is a type of throwing game where darts are thrown on a circular target held on a wall. The circular target is called the dartboard. Darts is most liked in the United Kingdom (which was the first country to call darts a sport), mainly in England, and is a pub game. Darts was first played around the 1870s.

A normal board is 17 and three-quarter inches in diameter and split into 20 sections, plus there are two circles in the middle, an outer ring and a triple ring (the ring halfway from the bull). Throwing the dart on the green ring (known as the "single bull") scores 25 points and the red spot (the "bull") scores 50 points. The 20 sections around the outside of the two circles each have a number from 1 to 20. The outer ring scores double the points and the triple ring scores triple. The highest score that can be made by throwing three darts is 180. This is where all three darts hit the triple 20.

The 20 numbers are arranged in a random order, and is still the order in the present day. From the top number clockwise, the numbers go 20, 1, 18, 4, 13, 6, 10, 15, 2, 17, 3, 19, 7, 16, 8, 11, 14, 9, 12 and 5.

Pennywise

Pennywise is an American melodic hardcore band. They formed in Hermosa Beach, California in 1988. The band is named after the monster from It, Stephen King's novel of the same title. Pennywise's most successful line-up, which remained togehter for 13 years (from 1996 to 2009), consisted of Jim Lindberg (vocals), Fletcher Dragge (guitars), Randy Bradbury (bass) and Byron McMackin (drums). They kept their original line-up until original bassist Jason Thirsk killed himself in 1996, because he had issues with his alcoholism. After that Bradbury replaced him. In August 2009, Lindberg left Pennywise and was replaced by Ignite singer Zoli Téglás.

Pennywise has released nine studio albums. After releasing two EPs in 1989, the band signed to Epitaph Records (a label owned by Bad Religion's Brett Gurewitz) in 1990. Their two first albums were not very successful. Pennywise's next album, "About Time", became a mainstream success. It was the band's first album to appear on the top 100 on the "Billboard" music chart and chart outside the United States. By this time, a number of punk bands, such as Bad Religion, Green Day, The Offspring, Rancid and NOFX, had hit the mainstream, but Pennywise did not want to be signed to a major label. When Bradbury joined in 1996 following Thrisk's death, Pennywise made even more popular albums and eventually became celebrities.

Their best known song is Bro Hymn form their self-titled debut album. After Thirsk's death, the band made a new version of this song as a tribute to Jason Thirsk which appeared on "Full Circle".

Their full-length albums include:


They released one live album:


They have also released two EPs:


"A Word from the Wise" and "Wildcard" were both repackaged in the 1992 compilation album "Wildcard/A Word from the 'Wise".

About Time

About Time is the third studio album by Pennywise, released on June 13, 1995.

While the album was not a commercial success, it is considered by some critics to be one of Pennywise's best releases, and it includes their concert staples, "Peaceful Day", "Perfect People", "Every Single Day", and "Same Old Story". About Time was also the first Pennywise album to chart in Billboard. Most of the album follows the theme of problems with time: fear of it passing, controlling it and accepting it.

About Time was also the last Pennywise album to feature bass player Jason Thirsk, who committed suicide on July 29, 1996. After debating whether to break up, or to continue on with a new bass player, Pennywise decided to hire a new bassist, Randy Bradbury, who would stay with the band permanently.

Jumping

Jumping is a form of movement in which an organism propels itself through the air along a ballistic trajectory. Jumping can be distinguished from running, galloping and other gaits in which the entire body is temporarily airborne by the relatively long duration.

Some animals, such as the kangaroo, employ jumping as their primary form of locomotion, while others, such as frogs, use it only as a means to escape predators. Jumping is also a key feature of various activities and sports, including the long jump, high jump, and show jumping.

One way to classify jumping is by the manner of foot transfer. In this classification system, five basic jumping forms are distinguished:

Maia Chiburdanidze

Maia Chiburdanidze (born 17 January 1961) is a Georgian chess grandmaster, and the seventh Women's World Chess Champion. She is the only chess player in history who has won nine Chess Olympiads. Maia is one of the very few women who has won a top-class grandmaster tournament. Chiburdanidze's FIDE Elo rating in the January 2010 list is 2514, and she is still the 11th highest rated female player in the world.

Maia Chiburdanidze was born in Kutaisi, Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, USSR and started playing chess around the age of eight. She became the USSR girls' champion in 1976 and a year later she won the Soviet women's title. In 1977 she was awarded the title of Woman Grandmaster.

Chiburdanidze finished 2nd in the Tbilisi Women's Interzonal (1976), thereby qualifying for the 1977 candidates matches. She advanced through to the Candidates Final, where she beat Alla Kushnir by 7½–6½ to set up a world title match in Pitsunda, Georgia, against Nona Gaprindashvili, the reigning women's world champion. Chiburdanidze defeated Gaprindashvili by 8½–6½. Then 17, she was and still is the youngest to win the Women's World Chess Championship.

She successfully defended her title four times. In 1981 she drew a tough match 8–8 against Nana Alexandria, in Tbilisi, but kept the title as Champion. Three years later she played Irina Levitina in Volgograd, Russia and won convincingly by 8–5. The next defense came against Elena Akhmilovskaya in Sofia in 1986, and Chiburdanidze won the match by 8½–5½. In 1988 she retained her title again by narrowly winning a match in Telavi, Georgia against Nana Ioseliani by 8½–7½.

She was awarded the grandmaster title in 1984. She was the second woman, after Gaprindashvili, to be awarded the title.

Xie Jun of China won the right to challenge for the world championship in February 1991. Chiburdanidze lost her crown to the young Chinese player in Manila by 8½–6½. Her reign was the third longest, at 14 years, behind only that of the first women's champion, Vera Menchik, who reigned for 17 years from 1927 until her death in 1944, and that of Gaprindashvili's 16 years.

She has attempted to regain the world title but, with the rise of the Chinese women and the formidable Polgár sisters, this has not proved possible.

Chiburdanidze, like many of the top women players, is not impressed with 'women's chess' in general, and she prefers to play chess with men. She has played extensively in men's tournaments around the world and her best form was seen in the 1980s and early 1990s. She was 1st in tournaments at New Delhi (1984) and Banja Luka (1985) and equal third at the very strong Bilbao 1987. In the next decade she finished 1st at Belgrade (1992), Vienna (1993) and Lippstadt (1995).

She was a key member of the USSR team that dominated the women's Olympiads of the 1980s. When Georgia achieved independence from the Soviet Union in 1990, she played board 1 for the new Georgian national team that won four gold medals, in 1992, 1994, 1996 and 2008.

She also played in the European Team Championships of 1997 when Georgia won the gold medal. In the 2008 Dresden Olympiad, she played on board 1 for Georgia, which won the gold medal (1st place). She won the gold medal for best performance.

Taiping Rebellion

The Taiping Rebellion was a civil war in China from 1850 to 1864. It was led by Hong Xiuquan. The Taiping Rebellion was against the ruling Qing Dynasty. About 20 million people died. Most of them were civilians.

Hong established the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (太平天囯). When it was most powerful, it had about 30 million people joining in it. The rebels tried to change society. Troops were nicknamed the Long hair (長毛, cháng máo).

Hung Xiuquan was a clever student. He wanted to go into government service. He studied hard and would probably have passed the government tests. However, he discovered that the officials in charge expected . Hung's family was poor at this time and did not have any money. Their family was loyal to the old Ming dynasty, and decided that his failure was because of the corrupt Manchu dynasty. Soon after, Hung became seriously ill. In a fever, Hung saw himself in the "Thirty-third Heaven". He said that he saw a man called the Venerable (Respected) in Years. The Venerable in Years gave Hung a sword and told him to destroy the demon-worshipers who had rebelled against the Venerable in Years. With the help of the Venerable in Years's son, Hung saw himself doing battle against the demon forces.
Shortly after he became healthy again, Hung read the Old Testament and believed it showed his vision was right. He felt that he had met with God and that God had chosen him for a son.

Hung wanted to know more about Christianity. The missionaries he met disagreed with Hung's vision. They did not agree that he was the brother of Jesus. Hung left them and decided to make his own cult. In Hung's cult, God was the Father, Christ was the Son and Elder (Older) Brother, and Hung was the Younger Brother. He called the New Testament the Former Testament. He called his own ideas the New Testament. Hung's friend Yang Xiuqing used to sell firewood. Yang claimed to be able to act as a voice of God, to direct the people and gain political power.

China was very weak at this time, and the people were hungry. People began to join Hung's new religion. By 1851 he had a ten-thousand-man army. The rebels cut off their pigtails and made their hair loose. This showed that they were in rebellion to the Manchu.

The Taiping Rebellion lasted from 1851 to 1864. It has been guessed that in the fighting 20 to 30 million people died. At last, corruption of the rebellion's leaders made people angry. Hung committed suicide in June 1864. His attacked capital, Nanking, became controlled by the Imperial Army.

Susan Polgar

Susan Polgar (born 19 April 1969 as "Polgár Zsuzsanna" and often known as "Zsuzsa Polgár") is a Hungarian-American chess player. 

At 15, she was the top-ranked woman player in the world. She was the Women's World Chess Champion from 1996 to 1999. In October 2005 Polgar had a FIDE rating of 2577, making her the second-ranked woman in the world at the time, after her sister Judit Polgár. She has been inactive and has not played in official competition since 2004.

Polgar is head of the Susan Polgar Institute for Chess Excellence at Texas Tech University, and a chess writer and promoter. She had been on the Executive of the United States Chess Federation, but was stripped of her membership after a complicated internal struggle.

Susan was born and brought up in Budapest, Hungary, and now lives in Lubbock, Texas. She recently moved from Forest Hills, Queens in New York City, where she ran the Polgar Chess Center and the Susan Polgar Foundation, which gives chess training to children, especially girls.

Polgar and her two younger sisters, Judit and Sofia, were part of an educational experiment carried out by their father László Polgár. He and his wife Klara educated their three daughters at home, with chess as the specialist subject. 

In January 1991, Polgar became the third woman to earn the Grandmaster title. Much is made, by her supporters, of the fact that Polgar had got the three GM norms and a rating over 2500. Nona Gaprindashvili was awarded the Grandmaster title in 1978 mainly as a result of winning Lone Pine International 1977, but she did not quite make the usual 24 games required at that time. Maia Chiburdanidze was awarded the GM title in 1984 for winning at New Delhi (1984), and for beating Nona Gaprindashvili and two others in matches for the Women's World Chess Championship. However, before Polgar reached the title, Chiburdanidze had more than achieved the traditional GM qualifications by her performances at Banja Luka and Bilbao. 

Polgar had tended to avoid women-only tournaments, but she abandoned this when she entered the 1993 cycle for the Women's World Championship. She became the Women's World Champion at her second attempt in 1996. Two years later, her title defense against Xie Jun of China was scheduled to take place in November, 1998. However, Polgar requested a postponement because she was pregnant and also FIDE had been unable to find a satisfactory sponsor. Ultimately, in 1999, a match was arranged, but under conditions to which Polgar objected – firstly because she had recently had a child, and had not had sufficient time to recuperate, and secondly because the match was to be held entirely in China, the home country of her challenger. She also wanted a significantly larger prize fund.

When Polgar refused to play under these conditions, FIDE declared that she had forfeited the title, and instead organized a match between Xie Jun and Alisa Galliamova for the Women's World Chess Championship, which was won by Xie Jun. Polgar sued in the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland for monetary damages and the restoration of her title. In March 2001, the case was settled, with Polgar withdrawing her claims and FIDE agreeing to pay Polgar's attorney's fees in the amount of $25,000. Since Xie Jun had already been crowned Women's World Champion, FIDE could not restore the title to Polgar. Polgar has not participated in subsequent Women's World Championship cycles.

Paid substantial appearance fees by the Hungarian Chess Federation, the family did play together in two female-only events. The Hungarians (nicknamed 'Polgaria') won the Women's Chess Olympiads, with a team packed with Polgárs, in 1988 and 1990. Zsuzsa, Judit, Sofia (the least strong sister) and Ildiko Madl were the team which pushed the Soviet Union into second place for the first time. 

The United States Chess Federation named Polgar "Grandmaster of the Year" in 2003, the first time a woman has won that honor. In that same year (2003), Polgar also became the first woman to win the US Open Blitz Championship, against a field which included seven grandmasters. She won that title again in 2005 and in 2006.

She helped train and played the top board for the United States women's team at the 2004 Chess Olympiad held in October in Majorca, Spain. Overall, the team won the silver medal, and Polgar won an individual gold medal. This was not her first Olympiad: she has a total of ten Olympiad Medals (five Gold, four Silver, and one Bronze). She has played 56 games in the Olympiads, never losing a single game.

In 1994, Polgar married computer consultant Jacob Shutzman, and moved to New York. They had two sons, Tom and Leeam, but later divorced. In December 2006, she married her long time business manager and friend, Paul Truong.

Polgar has written several books:

Polgar is also a chess journalist, with columns in "Chess Life", "Chess Life for Kids", "ChessCafe", "Chess Horizons", "Georgia Chess", "Chessville", "Empire Chess", "School Mates", and "Europe Echecs".

Against the Grain

Against the Grain is the fifth album by American punk rock band Bad Religion, released on the Californian independent record label Epitaph Records on November 23, 1990. After the release of this album, drummer Pete Finestone left Bad Religion in 1991 to concentrate with his new project The Fishermen. Following his departure, their music would take a different direction on their next album, 1992's "Generator".

"Against the Grain" was highly anticipated by both music critics and fans as a result of the band's success with their last two albums, "Suffer" and "No Control". Even though "Against the Grain" still did not break Bad Religion into mainstream audiences, it was the first 100,000 seller, and showed how quickly they were growing.

The album's 13th track, "21st Century (Digital Boy)", was re-recorded and appeared on their eighth full-length studio album "Stranger Than Fiction". The "Stranger Than Fiction" version of that song made Bad Religion even more popular.

The album got the band's highest U.S. chart position to date, debuting at #14 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart, and scored the radio hits "American Jesus" and "Struck a Nerve".

Public nudity is nudity that is not in private. It means a person being nude in a public place, or seen from public places. Nudity in private places, such as a home, swimming pool, or nudist club does not count, as these are private places.

In some places, public nudity may be legal. For example, some beaches are nude beaches, where nudity is allowed.

In most other places, public nudity is unacceptable. It is often illegal. Exhibitionists often appear nude in public to attract attention. Protesters also appear naked in public at times. 

Nudism promotes public nudity in a group, but in special locations.

Zanesville, Ohio

Zanesville is a city in and the county seat of Muskingum County, Ohio, United States. The population was 25,487 at the 2010 census.

It was founded by Ebenezer Zane. Zane had constructed Zane's Trace, a pioneer road through present-day Ohio. He settled in the area in 1797 with his son-in-law, John McIntire. They put the town at the point where Zane's Trace met the Muskingum River. 

From 1810-1812, the city was the second state capital of Ohio. The National Road runs through Zanesville as U.S. Route 40. Novelist Zane Grey, a descendant of the Zane family, was born in the city. 

The city has two engineering landmarks: the Muskingum River Canal, designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark; and the Zanesville Y-Bridge, the only such structure in the United States still in use and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Boeing X-37

The Boeing X-37 Advanced Technology Demonstrator is an unpiloted demonstration spaceplane that is intended to test future spaceflight technologies while in orbit and during atmospheric reentry. It is a reusable robotic spacecraft based on the smaller X-40. The X-37 began as a NASA project in 1999, then was transferred to the US Department of Defense in 2004. The X-37 had its first flight as a drop test in April 2006 at Edwards AFB. The spacecraft was launched in April 2010 to begin a United States Air Force mission.

In 1999, NASA chose Boeing to design the vehicle. The vehicle was built at the California branch of Boeing's Phantom Works. At the end of 2002, a new $300 million contract was awarded to Boeing in the framework of NASA’s Space Launch Initiative.

The X-37 was transferred from NASA to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in September, 2004. The program has become a secretive, though it is not known whether DARPA will maintain this status for the project.

In June 2005, the X-37 completed a captive-carry flight underneath the White Knight at Mojave Spaceport, Mojave, California. Through the second half of 2005, the X-37 underwent structural upgrades including reinforcement of the nose wheel supports. Further captive-carry flight tests and the first drop test were expected mid-February 2006.

March 2006 was scheduled for the X-37's first free flight but a snow storm covered the area, dropping snow on the Mojave. The next flight attempt in March was canceled due to high winds. In late March the X-37 flew, but a flaw prevented the free flight and the vehicle returned to the ground still docked with its White Knight carrier. In April 2006, the X-37 made its first free glide flight. During landing the vehicle ran off the runway. After the vehicle was repaired, the program moved from Mojave to Air Force Plant 42 (KPMD) in Palmdale, California for the remainder of the flight test program. White Knight continued to be based at Mojave, but would ferry over to Plant 42 when flights were scheduled. Five additional flights were performed, at least one of which is believed to have been a free flight with a successful landing.
In November 2006 the U.S. Air Force announced it would develop the X-37B from the NASA X-37A. The Air Force version is designated X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV). The OTV program builds on industry and government investments by DARPA, NASA and the Air Force. The X-37B effort will be led by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office and includes partnerships with NASA and the Air Force Research Laboratory. Boeing is the prime contractor for the OTV program. The X-37B can remain in orbit for up to 270 days at a time.

The Secretary of the Air Force states the OTV program will focus on "risk reduction, experimentation, and operational concept development for reusable space vehicle technologies, in support of long term developmental space objectives."

The X-37B was originally scheduled for launch in the payload bay of the Space Shuttle, but following the "Columbia" accident, it was transferred to a Delta II. It was then transferred to the Atlas V following concerns over the spacecraft's aerodynamic properties during launch.

The first orbital flight of the X-37B, was launched on an Atlas V rocket at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida in April 2010. The spacecraft was placed into low Earth orbit for testing, and then will land at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California .

A second X-37B is being manufactured for a test mission scheduled for 2011.

The main engines are fueled by JP-8 kerosene, a military standard jet fuel. The maneuvering engines are fueled by hydrogen peroxide. This is wrong, the propellants were changed to hypergols long ago when it was a NASA program.

The X-37 was originally designed to be carried into orbit in the Space Shuttle cargo bay, but underwent redesign for launch on a Delta IV or comparable rocket after it was determined that a shuttle flight would be uneconomical.

This vehicle has the potential to become the United States' first operational military spaceplane, after the cancellation of Dyna-Soar in 1963. It is expected to operate in a velocity range of up to Mach 25 on reentry. Among the technologies to be demonstrated with the X-37 are improved thermal protection systems, avionics, the autonomous guidance system, and an advanced airframe. The on-board engine is the Rocketdyne AR-2/3, which is fueled by hydrogen peroxide and JP-8.

The X-37's aerodynamic design was derived from the Space Shuttle, hence the X-37 has a similar lift-to-drag ratio, and a lower cross range at high altitudes and mach numbers than the Hypersonic Technology Vehicle.

The test vehicle, which was used as an atmospheric drop test glider, had no propulsion system. Instead of an operational vehicle's payload bay doors it had an enclosed and reinforced upper fuselage structure to allow it to be mated with a mothership. Most of the thermal protection tiles were 'fake', made of inexpensive foam rather than ceramic; a smaller number of the X-37's tiles were actual TPS tiles, and TPS blankets were used in areas where heating would not have been severe enough to require tiles.

Following their missions, X-37B spacecraft are to land on a runway at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California with Edwards Air Force Base as an alternate site.

An Aftershock is a smaller earthquake which comes after a large earthquake (called the main shock) in the same area. An aftershock is the opposite of a foreshock, which a small earthquake comes before the large earthquake.

There are many laws which aftershocks meet, but the most famous is Omori's Law. In 1894, Fusakichi Omori did some works on aftershocks, and firstly he came up with this rule:

By 1961, Utsu wanted to change the rule. His rule looked like this:

Barcode

A barcode is a way of optically representing data. Originally, barcodes represented data in the widths (lines) and the spacings of parallel lines, and may be referred to as linear or 1D (1 dimensional) barcodes. 2D systems use symbols other than bars, but they are still referred to as barcodes as well. Barcodes can be read by optical scanners called barcode readers, or scanned from an image by special software.

The first use of barcodes was to label railroad cars, but they were not commercially successful until they were used to automate supermarket checkout systems, a task in which they have become almost universal. Their use has spread to many other roles as well, but the simplicity, universality and low cost of barcodes has limited the role of these other systems.
Barcodes—especially the Universal Product Code, UPC—have slowly become an essential part of modern life. Their use is widespread, and the technology behind barcodes is constantly improving. Some modern applications of barcodes include:

In point-of-sale management, the use of barcodes can provide up-to-date information on aspects of the business. For example:
The reason barcodes are business-friendly is that the scanners are relatively low cost and extremely accurate compared to key-entry, with only about 1 substitution error in 15,000 to 36 trillion characters entered. The exact error rate depends on the type of barcode.

Optical character recognition

Optical character recognition (OCR) is a method of automatic data entry. OCR software is used to convert handwritten, type-written or printed text into data that can be edited on a computer. 
In simple systems, the paper documents are scanned with an image scanner. The OCR software then looks at the image and compares the shapes of the letters to stored images of letters. In this way, it makes a text file that can be edited with a normal text editor.

More complex systems look at images, layout and so on. This can make editable electronic versions which look identical to the original documents.

OCR works best with clean, clearly printed materials.

Istrian Italians

Istrian Italians are one of the ethnic groups of Istria. The others are Croatians, Slovenians and Istrorumanians.

The Istrian Italians are the descendants of the romanized Illyrian population of Istria during the Roman Empire. During the Middle Ages they were under domination of many political states, like the Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman Empire. But most of the time they were under the Republic of Venice, especially during the Renaissance.

The Istrian Italians enjoyed a huge cultural development in the centuries under Venice: Pola and Capodistria were important centers of art and culture during the Italian Renaissance. Personalities like Pier Paolo Vergerio (a famous "Humanist") and Santorius Santorio (a physician who discovered the medical thermometer) are renowned worldwide.

In the last two centuries the Istrian Italians, who were the majority of the population of Istria under Napoleon, have been in continuous ethnic fighting with the Slavs of Istria. As a consequence now they are reduced to a small minority, who have survived the Istrian exodus and the Foibe massacres during and after WWII. 

According to the Italian Census done in 1936, in the peninsula of Istria there were 294,000 residents: most were Istrian Italians. Here there are the percentages for all the Istrian cities/districts:

The Istrian Italians are nearly 50,000 in our days, a small minority of the Istria peninsula population. They are mainly divided between Croatia and Slovenia, but a few thousands still live in Italy (in the coastal city of Muggia near Trieste).

Indeed, in various municipalities in actual Croatia and Slovenia, census data shows that there are still significant numbers of Italians living in Istria, such as 51% of the population of Grožnjan/Grisignana, 37% at Brtonigla/Verteneglio and nearly 30% in Buje/Buie.

Design management

"Simply put, "design management" is the business side of design. Design management encompasses the ongoing processes, business decisions, and strategies that enable innovation and create effectively-designed products, services, communications, environments, and brands that enhance our quality of life and provide organizational success." 
This means that design management is not limited on a single design discipline. In his 'Classification of Design' (1976), Gorb divided design into three different classes; design management operates in and across all three categories:

Design management is not independent from the organization and product context, and plays three integrative key roles in the interface of design, organisation and market:

Supportive activities are used in design management to manage design more efficient ('doing the things right') and effectively ('doing the right things'). Depending on a multitude of factors (such as industry, company size, design focus, market situation and the position / role of design within the company), design managers have a broad range of job profiles, with very different roles, activities and responsibilities.

It is difficult to exactly trace the history of design management. Even though design management as an expression is first mentioned in literature in 1964, earlier contributions created the context in which design management could arise. Throughout its history design management was influenced by a number of different disciplines (e.g. architecture, industrial design, management, software development, engineering) and movements (e.g. system theory, design methodologies) and in its understanding it can be attributed neither directly to design nor to management.

Historical development of design management: 
Design management can be divided by its different fields of application into the three different levels:

Middlegame

The middlegame is the part of a game of chess after the opening.

The middlegame begins when most of the pieces have been developed. It is where most games are won and lost. Many games will end in resignation even before an endgame takes place.<ref name="H/W">Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. "The Oxford companion to chess". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.</ref> 

The simplest way to learn the middlegame is to select an opening and learn it well (see examples in English opening and French defence). 

A middlegame position has a structure, caused by the opening. These are some things to look for when looking at a middlegame position:

• Material: changes in the balance of material are critical. To lose a piece for nothing is enough to lose a game. If the players are evenly matched, then a rough material balance of pieces is normal. Material balance is often quite static: it doesn't change for many moves. On the other hand, material may be sacrificed, usually for a direct attack on the opposing king.

• Development: the opening may have left one player with a lead in development. That player has the initiative, and may attack before the opponent can get his pieces out. It is a temporary asset: if a lead in development is not used effectively, it will disappear.

• The centre: in the centre pieces have their greatest effect, and some (such as the knight) attack more squares in the centre than at the sides. The player who controls the centre will almost always have the advantage.

• Mobility: a position is mobile if the pieces can get where they need to. Almost all middle game positions have some limitations to mobility. Look for open files for the rooks, and open diagonals for the bishops. Outposts are what knights need, places where they can't easily be dislodged.

• King safety: where is the king? Ideally, a king should be castled, and kept behind a screen of pawns. Many other things may happen in practice. If a king is weak, it may be put under direct attack. If the kings castle on opposite wings, and queens are on the board, both players may try to assault the enemy king. 

• Pawns provide the skeleton of a position. They move slowly, and may become blocked for many moves. Everything takes place round the pawns. Different openings produce different pawn structures. In this way openings influence the whole game. Notice these things when they occur:

What the player does is note the features on the board, and formulate a plan which takes the features into account. Then the player works out a sequence of moves. Of course, in practice, the opponent is interfering with the plan at every step!

The Tarrasch variation of the French defence gives us: 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2 c5 (3...Nf6 is popular) 4.exd5 exd5 5.Nf3 Nc6 6.Bb5 Bd6 7.dxc5 Bxc5 8.0-0 Ne7 9.Nb3 Bd6 10.Re1 0-0 11.Bg5 Bg4 and so on. Now the opening is over, and all the pieces are developed. This line is quiet, and mostly about the centre.

The isolated black QP is what gives the middlegame its character. The pawn itself is both a weakness and a potential source of strength. It controls the very important square e4, but leaves the equally important d4 much weaker. The position is fairly equal, but the database shows that White has an advantage of about 7%.

In the English opening this line became popular: 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 e6 3.e4 c5 4.e5 Ng8 5.Nf3 Nc6 6.d4 (this is the critical move: White tries to take advantage of his development at the expense of a pawn) 6...cxd4 7.Nxd4 Nxe5 8.Ndb5 a6 9.Nd6+ Bxd6 10.Qxd6 f6 11.Be3 Ne7 12. Bb6 (looks like it wins the Q) Nf5 and now both 11.Qc5 and 11.Bxd8 give White an advantage of only 2.4%.

The variation involved a number of middlegame themes: rapid development, material sacrifice, exploiting weak squares. In total, it is a frantic struggle for the centre.

Rapid development is the benefit of the old-style gambits. An opening such as 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Bc4 (known as the Danish Gambit) is virtually never played nowadays, but White does get good value for his pawn(s). Some trainers recommend young players try this out to learn how to get the best out of rapid development.

Many middlegames are played around blocked or semi-blocked pawn chains. The pawn chains are decisive in deciding the players' plans. These plans often involve a K-side v Q-side struggle, with each player attacking his opponent's pawn base.

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Ne7 7.Qg4 Qc7 (7...0-0 is possible) 8.Qxg7 Rg8 9.Qxh7 cxd4 10.Ne2 and so on. The play in lines like this is strongly asymmetric: White owns the kingside, and Black owns the queenside.

This example, from the Winawer variation, is an extreme case. Each side plays a maximum of moves attacking the opponent's weak side, and as few moves as possible defending his own weak side. This is a general principle for these unbalanced K-side v Q-side positions.

Here is an example from the borderline between opening and middlegame. In the diagram to the left, White will operate mainly on the Q-side, and Black on the K-side. The reason for this is that the black d6 pawn and the white e4 pawn are the bases of their pawn chains. It was Nimzovich who pointed out that such pawns are usually the most vulnerable to attack.

White, to play, may wish to cope with Black playing 10...Nf4. He can do this by playing 10.g3, or by playing 10.Re1 so that if 10...Nf4 11.Bf1 will preserve the bishop (in this position an important defensive piece). Or maybe White will plough ahead with 10.c5, the key move on the Q-side. 

ChessBase shows that the number of tournament games with these choices were:

The data base also shows that the overall results were significantly better for 10.Re1. What the player does is note the features on the board, and formulate a plan which takes the features into account. Then the player works out a sequence of moves. Of course, in practice, the opponent is interfering with the plan at every step!

Safety of the king is probably the most common theme in the later middlegame. This example is a classic. Two pawns up, White could win the endgame by exchanging queens. However, he thought he saw something better.
This is a skewer, because if the black queen moves aside, then Rxg7+ gives mate.
This brilliant reply puts its finger on White's weak point: the back rank.

VHS

VHS means Video Home System. This system uses a cassette tape to record video and sound, which can be watched on a television. A DVD/VHS combo can record(write) on VHS tapes, read off VHS tapes, and additionally, read from DVD discs.

VHS cassettes can be recorded using a video camera. They can also be recorded with a video cassette recorder, or VCR. A VCR can use a VHS cassette to record broadcast television.

This system was created in 1976 by the Victor Company of Japan (also called JVC). VHS was a very popular way for people to record and play video at home in the 1980s and 1990s, but now DVD (or Digital Versatile Disc) has become more popular as they can store better quality video, can be easier to use, and the discs are cheaper to make. However in many less rich countries, (especially some parts of Asia) the VCD (Video CD) is often much more popular than the DVD because the disks and the player are much cheaper, and the quality is similar to a VHS tape.

Agustín Ross

Agustín Ross Edwards (February 5, 1844, La Serena, Chile - October 20, 1926, Viña del Mar, Chile) was a Chilean politician, diplomatic and banker. He was son of David Ross and Carmen Edwards. He was married with Susana Ferari.

Ross studied in the Carlos Black and Simon Kerr School, in La Serena. He later went to Scotland, where he studied in the Queen Streat Institution, between 1856 and 1860. He participated in the trades of the bank of the Edwards family. He was a private agent in London of the Government Junta of Iquique in 1891. He was plenipotenciary minister in Great Britain in February 1892.

Ross went to Pichilemu circa 1890, and he bought some areas in the town. In San Fernando, in September 1885, he bought the property of Francisco Torrealba, a terrain that lasted at the Pichilemu beach. He first constructed the Ross Hotel with a European-style design, assigning Evaristo Merino as its administrator, meanwhile he started promoting Pichilemu in cities as Santiago de Chile. He later constructed the Ross Casino and the Ross Park. They used materials as: shards from Italy, Oregon pine from the United States, cement from Portland. A Chilean chronicler quoted:

Ross was militant of the National Party of Chile. He was Senator of the Coquimbo Province between 1897 and 1903.

Ross died in October 26, 1926, in Viña del Mar. Later, his succession donated to the Municipality of Pichilemu their forest, terraces, park, perrons, among others, with the condition that they should be attended worthily.

<doc id="240345" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=240345" title="Woolmer green">
Woolmer green

Woolmer green is a settlement in Hertfordshire, England.

Situated between the villages of Welwyn and Knebworth, Woolmer Green was first settled in the Iron Age. The Belgae colonised the area in the 1st century BC, and later it was settled by the Romans. Many Roman artefacts have been found in the surrounding area with a Roman bath house existing at nearby Welwyn. The village was at the junction of two thoroughfares, the Great North Road and another road called Stane Street (or Stone Street) from St Albans. The route of this road runs across the parish along the path of Robbery Bottom Lane, continuing on as a public bridleway to Datchworth and then Braughing, on its eventual way to another major Roman town, Colchester.

Thomas de Wolvesmere is recorded as having lived in a dwelling here in 1297, and his name is considered to have led to the current name of the village.

Woolmer Green has always been one of those places which is “neither here nor there”. In the Middle Ages part of the village was in Mardleybury Manor, part in Rectory Manor, with the northern part owing allegiance to Broadwater Manor or Knebworth. Things have not changed; the village is still at the point where the Districts of North Hertfordshire, East Hertfordshire and Welwyn Hatfield meet. 

Apart from the trade generated by travellers, life in Woolmer Green was agricultural and feudal until the middle of the nineteenth century. Things started to change, however, when the railway arrived in 1850 (although the nearby station in Knebworth was not opened until 1884 after intervention from Viscount Knebworth). The village school, which was opened a few years after this, obtained much funding from the railway.

In 1863, only a gunsmith and a shoemaker were listed in the trade directory. By 1898, when the population of Woolmer Green stood at 363 and that of Knebworth at 382, there were five shops including two beer retailers; no mention in the trade directory of the many ‘front room shops’! This level of service persisted until recent years with a general store and Post Office, a baker, a small supermarket and a butcher. Sadly these have all now closed.

The main road through the centre of the village was still the Great North Road down which thousands of cattle and sheep were driven ‘on the hoof’ to London markets each year. The area around Knebworth and Woolmer Green provided what was probably the last overnight stop for the animals and their drovers before they reached London.

Life sounds good when looked at in retrospect but the majority of the residents of Woolmer Green were dependent on farming and the 1879 harvest, which was the worst of the century, resulted in the leases of many farms in the area being relinquished, and thus labourers not being employed to work on them. At this time there was quite an influx of farmers from Scotland and Cornwall. They must have considered the prospects here to be better than their own, and indeed they were actively lured here by the owners of the local agricultural land, which at that time was largely owned by the big land-owning estates, particularly in this immediate area by the Knebworth Estate.

During the 20th century the village became a popular destination for tourists travelling to and from London as it lies on the old Great North Road from London to Edinburgh. Many who passed along the road would have visited the cottage inhabited by the late Harry McDonald, who for many years adorned both the cottage and garden with intricate carvings of animals and other objects. He became famous as the Woodcarver of Woolmer Green; sadly The Woodcarvers Cottage, as it came to be known, was demolished after his death.

Prior to the millennium year, 2000, Woolmer Green was part of the parish of Welwyn for local government purposes. In that year, however, the parish gained its independence from its neighbour, and the inaugural meeting of the Parish Council was held in May 2000. The first chairman of the new Woolmer Green Parish Council, Judith Watson, was instrumental in achieving the separation.

The boundary between Woolmer Green and Welwyn parishes is formed by the path of the East Coast Mainline railway. The small viaduct to the south of the Parish, at the end of Robbery Bottom Lane, follows the same basic design as the long Digswell Viaduct. It was designed by William Cubitt and built by Thomas Brassey between 1848 and 1850 for the sum of £4,643. There are seven arches with a height above the roadway of 17m and a length of 60m. The viaduct and the bridges over London Road and Heath Road are all original, dating from when the railway was first built, although they have been strengthened and the parapets raised.

Immediately to the south of the viaduct the railway enters the first of two tunnels (with a very short open section in the middle) between Woolmer Green and the station at Welwyn North. The first tunnel heading south was the site of a notorious accident in 1866.

There was a temporary railway halt at Woolmer Green during the war which was used by soldiers, but nowadays the nearest station is just down the road at Knebworth, built in 1884 at the request of Viscount Knebworth. Until then the railway was used as a means of transferring manure from all the stables in London to a convenient place in the country. Chutes were constructed so that the manure could be shovelled down on to the roads and the local farmers then picked it up to use as fertiliser.

The parish has an excellent modern Village Hall and adjoining sports field which are very actively used by the community. The hall was opened in November 1990 by local celebrity Barry Norman and is licensed for wedding ceremonies.

Though Sunday services had been held in the school since 1878 there were many people in Woolmer Green who thought it was high time that the village had its own church. This was a wish particularly dear to the heart of the Revd Edwin Hoskyns, who was a curate at Welwyn when part of the school was consecrated as a church.

The problem of finding a suitable site for the new church, which was to be dedicated to St Michael and All Angels, was soon solved when Lord Lytton presented the Church authorities with the plot of land at the junction of London Road and Mardleybury Road, which was to prove an ideal site with easy access for the majority of the villagers. The church was designed by Robert Weir Schultz (1860–1951), a modest example of late Arts and Crafts. The estimated cost was £2500 and the contract was given to Mr E Lawrence of Datchworth. The foundation stone was laid in September 1899 by Lady Lytton who used a silver trowel for the task.

It was originally felt that the church should have a tower but it proved impossible to raise the necessary funds. By October 1899 only £1500 had been promised so the decision was taken that only the walls and the roof of the church should be built, and the internal fittings left to be proceeded with as the money came in. It was suggested in the Parish Magazine that the children of the parish should contribute towards the cost of the font: ‘Each can give very little, but the pennies and halfpennies of 350 children will quickly mount up, and all alike will feel they have a share in the new building.’

The church was to be named St Michael and All Angels in the hope that it would be consecrated at Michaelmas, 29 September 1900. However, it was not until 3 November 1900 that the consecration of the church and burial ground took place. The people of the village no longer needed to ‘marry and bury’ at Datchworth or Welwyn.

The church screen is a significant example of late Arts-and-Crafts design and carving. It is said that the school bell was bought for the church in 1931 at a cost of £10.

Mary of Modena

Mary of Modena (Maria Beatrice Eleonora Anna Margherita Isabella d'Este; – ) was Queen consort of England, Scotland and Ireland. She was also the second wife of King James II. Mary was a very firm Catholic. She married James, Duke of York, (the future James II) in 1673. He was the younger brother of Charles II. Mary was not interested in politics. Instead, she was devoted to James, and gave birth to two children who lived to become adults. They were Louise Mary and the Jacobite James Francis Edward Stuart, who became known in history as "The Old Pretender".

Mary was born as a princess of the Italian Duchy of Modena. She is mostly remembered for the birth of James Francis Edward. Most of the English people thought he was not really Mary's son. They believed he had been secretly brought into the birth-room in a warming-pan to continue King James II's Catholic rule. The privy council investigation declared that the story was false. However, James Francis Edward's birth was one of the reasons why the Glorious Revolution happened. In the Glorious Revolution, King James II was deposed by his daughter Mary and her husband William III of Orange.

The "Queen over the water"—as Jacobites (followers of James II) called Mary—was exiled to France. She lived with her family in the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which Louis XIV of France had given her. Louis XIV's liked Mary, but thought James was not interesting. When James died, Mary spent a lot of time with the nuns at the Convent of Chaillot. When James II died in 1701, the Jacobites saw James Francis Edward as king. Because he was too young to rule, Queen Dowager Mary acted as regent until he became 16. Later, "James III" was forced to leave France because of the Treaty of Utrecht. This left Mary without any family in France (Princess Louise Mary had died of smallpox). Mary died of cancer in 1718. She was kindly remembered by the people in France at that time.

Mary Beatrice d'Este was the older child of Alfonso IV, Duke of Modena and his wife Laura Martinozzi. She was born on 5 October 1658 NS in Modena. Her only sibling, Francesco, became a Duke when his father died in 1662. This was the year Mary became 4. Mary and Francesco's mother Laura was firm with her children. She acted as regent of the duchy until her son grew older. Mary's education was very good. She spoke French and Italian well, and had a knew much of Latin and, later, English.

Sherman, Texas

Sherman is a city in northern Texas near Dallas and Oklahoma. It is the county seat of Grayson county.

Around 57% of its population are under 45 years old. White people represent about 78% of people in Sherman, following by Hispanic (12%), and black (African American) 11%.

Sherman was created in 1846 by the Texas legislature. Sherman got its name from General Sydney Sherman. That was the name of a hero of Texas's revolution. 
Sherman had some human and environmental problems over the years. 
For example, a huge tornado happened in 1896. 

A race riot happened in 1930 after a black man was accused of raping a white woman. People from the town burned the man in his jail cell and took his body into the streets. The people also burned down the black business district.

However, Sherman continued to grow, especially when a pilot training base called Perrin Field was built there. Perrin Field was closed in 1971.

Sherman is about 65 miles north of Dallas at the crossroads of U.S. Highway 75 and US 69. It has a lot of institutions. It even has its own symphony orchestra, which is not common for a city of its size. Manufacturing is a big part of the local economy. Also, several national companies have plants in Sherman. It is a good city for tourism and international students.

Speech recognition

Speech recognition (also known as voice recognition) is the process of converting spoken words into computer text. The user speaks into a microphone and the computer creates a text file of the words they have spoken.

Although the of these systems has improved in recent years they are still far from perfect. If you only need them to recognise a few words, for example the words "one, two, three" etc., then speech recognition software can be very accurate. This is why this feature has started to appear on modern mobile phones. But systems that can recognise any word spoken by any person in any language are still a few years away.

You can greatly improve the accuracy of these systems by "training" them to recognise just one voice. This is usually done by getting the user to read a short set piece of text into the microphone. The user looks at the text which has been created and corrects any mistakes the software has made. By repeating this a number of times the computer's accuracy increases a great deal.

Total Drama Action

Total Drama Action is the 2nd season in the Total Drama television series. It started on June 11, 2009. The players on the show are Geoff, Bridgette, Izzy, Trent, Gwen, Owen, Heather, Le-Shawna, Courtney, Beth, Lindsay, Justin, Harold, Duncan, DJ,

Like the previous season, much of "Total Drama Action" chronicles the events of the eponymous fictional reality shows. The "Total Drama" series itself is an "animated reality television series", which stars the cast and crew of the fictional series, parodying many aspects of reality television in general.

After last season's winner, Owen (Scott McCord), forgoes his prize money of C$100,000 for a challenge (open to all 22 of "Total Drama Island" contestants) in which the winner would receive C<nowiki>$</nowiki>1,000,000, the money was left in limbo after a situation resulted in a 14-way tie. As such, show host Chris McLean (Christian Potenza) had no choice but to commission a second competition with all 14 tied contestants. The contestants are told to arrive at an abandoned movie studio lot in Toronto, where the new competition, titled "Total Drama Action", would take place. Because of its location, Chris tells the contestants that the challenges would all be in the form of various movie genres. The accommodations of the contestants are handled by Chef Hatchet (Clé Bennett) in a similar manner to how it was handled in the previous season. 

After a quick elimination of two contestants, the couple Geoff (Dan Petronijevic) and Bridgette (Kristin Fairlie), a second challenge determined the team captains of the two competing teams: the Screaming Gaffers, headed by Gwen (Megan Fahlenbock), and the Killer Grips, headed by Trent (Scott McCord). From then on, challenges would alternate between "reward challenges" where winners would receive a special prize, and "elimination challenges" where the losing team would vote off one of its own in an elaborate "Gilded Chris Ceremony". The pattern of reducing the contestants down was briefly interrupted on two occasions: once when Izzy (Katie Crown) was reinstated following a voting irregularity where her alter-ego, "E-Scope", was voted off, and another time when Courtney (Emilie-Claire Barlow), a contestant who did not originally qualify for "Total Drama Action", successfully sued the show. The players eliminated would make the "walk of shame" and into the "Lame-o-sine", where they leave the movie studio.

Once seven contestants were left, the Screaming Gaffers and the Killer Grips were dissolved, and the challenges became individual-oriented in nature. Chris hired Owen as his ringer to sabotage the other contestants and to create drama. Eventually, two contestants were left standing: Beth (Sarah Gadon) and Duncan (Drew Nelson). The Total Drama Action winner was Duncan. Beth wins in the alternate ending.

Sprinkled among the episodes (taking the place of reward challenges) is "TDA Aftermath", a show-within-a-show hosted by Geoff and Bridgette, commissioned shortly after their eliminations. On "TDA Aftermath", Geoff and Bridgette interview eliminated contestants on their "Total Drama Action" experiences. They are accompanied by the contestants of "Total Drama Island" that did not qualify for "Total Drama Action", as well as other previously-eliminated contestants. "TDA Aftermath" consisted of various "never-before-seen footage" sequences (purportedly taking place during the events of previous episodes), as well as two recurring segments, "That's Gonna Leave a Mark" (a segment of the contestants getting badly hurt), and "Truth or..." (in which a contestant is interviewed and are hurt if they lie to the hosts or the studio audience).

When the field eventually narrowed down to two contestants, (Beth and Duncan), a final obstacle course challenge would lead the contestants into the Aftermath set, with the first one arriving winning the show's million-dollar grand prize. Unfortunately, Beth and Duncan had sufficiently cooperated enough though the final challenge to arrive at the same time, and what was meant as a season recap became a show in which the winner would be determined. After efforts by the eliminated and nonparticipant contestants to come up with an impartial way of determining the winner all fail, Chris (supposedly leaving on vacation) ultimately returns to the set and has the eliminated (but not the nonparticipant) contestants vote for the winner who was eventually Duncan.

Slate

Slate is a metamorphic rock. It is formed from shale by being under pressure and moderate heat. Shale itself is formed from muddy clay, and splits into thin plates. This characteristic splitting is carried over into slate.

Schist is a rather similar type of metamorphic rock, and students need to learn the difference.

Roofing slates are used in many countries, though ceramic tiles have gradually taken over. Heavier slates can be used for flooring (inside and outside). Slates are used for the cladding (surface skin) of buildings, and sometimes in Wales there are whole buildings of slate. Gravestones and memorial plaques are another use. Thick slate is used for billiard tables and laboratory bench tops, where its resistance to temperature changes and chemicals is useful. Slate was used for blackboards and writing tablets in schools.

Bantu languages

The Bantu languages (or Narrow Bantu languages) are a branch of the Niger-Congo languages. There are about 520 languages in the Bantu family, 670 languages in the Southern Bantoid branch which includes Bantu, and 1,532 in Niger-Congo. Bantu languages are spoken largely east and south of the present day country of Cameroon; i.e., in the regions commonly known as central Africa, east Africa, and southern Africa. Parts of the Bantu area include languages from other language families (see map). The Bantu language with the largest total number of speakers is Swahili.

The Bantu language with the largest number of native speakers is Shona with 13.8 million speakers in Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Botswana and Zambia. Zulu comes second with 10.3 million speakers.

The Bantu languages came from the region of eastern Nigeria or Cameroon. About 2000 years ago the Bantu people spread southwards and eastwards, introducing agriculture and iron working and colonizing much of the continent.

Some words from various Bantu languages have been borrowed into western languages. These include:

The Niger-Congo languages are one of the world's major language families, and Africa's largest in terms of geographical area, number of speakers, and number of distinct languages. They may constitute the world's largest language family in terms of distinct languages, although this question is complicated by ambiguity about what constitutes a distinct language. Most of the most widely spoken indigenous languages of Subsaharan Africa belong to this group. A common property of many Niger-Congo languages is the use of a noun class system. The most widely spoken Niger-Congo languages by native speaker are Yoruba, Igbo, Fula and Shona. The most widely spoken by total number of speakers is Swahili.

Wawel Dragon

The Wawel Dragon is a well known Polish folktale. The dragon lived in a cave under Wawel Hill, on the banks of the Vistula River. Wawel Hill is in the city of Kraków, in Poland. 
The Wawel Cathedral and Kraków's castle are built on Wawel Hill. In the cathedral there is a statue of the dragon. The dragon's cave under the castle is now a popular tourist stop.
 
There are many versions of the folk tale. This is one of them.
A long, long time ago, when Prince Krak was the ruler of Krakow, many young girls kept on being lost, and no one in Krakow knew what had happened to them. It turned out that there was an evil dragon living in a big cave under Wawel Hill. The dragon was stealing farm animals and young girls. Prince Krak said: "The person who kills the dragon will get half of the country and will marry my daughter." Many brave soldiers tried to kill the dragon, but none of them could. Finally, a young shoe-maker came up with an idea! He filled a sheep's skin with salt and left it in front of the dragon’s cave. The greedy dragon saw the salt filled sheep and ate it in one bite. Soon he started to feel a burning pain in his stomach. The pain got worse. It burned more and more. Wanting water, he ran to the Vistula River and started to drink fast. He drank and drank but it was still burning. So he continued to drink, until he burst! The city was rid of the mean dragon, and the shoemaker got his prize from the ruler and married his daughter.

In 1970 a statue of the Wawel Dragon was placed in front of the dragon's den. It has six legs, and it breathes fire every few minutes.

Renal cell carcinoma

Renal cell carcinoma is a form of renal cancer. It is often curable if found early, but prognosis is poor if it has already metastasized when the person has been diagnosed. 

In cases of early-stage renal cell carcinoma, removal of the affected kidney is the treatment of choice. In some cases, nephrectomy can be partial rather than complete (some kidney is left behind). However, stage IV cases of renal cell carcinoma are more difficult to treat, with current treatments including Interleukin-2 which induces a response in about 5-10% of cases. Other treatments used include Nexavar, Torisel, Sutent, Interferon, and Bevacizumab. Surgical removal of both the primary tumor and the metastases may be considered in selected cases. Oncophage cancer vaccine may also be effective in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma.
Surgery to remove liver metastases in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma involving the liver may be beneficial.

Air travel

Air travel is a process of going from place to place by any flying object, such as airplanes, helicopters, hot air balloons or anything that can fly. 

Air travel has been a very long dream of human being from the ancient age. People seeing birds flying tried to take a flight in many ways and finally came up with balloons and machines that could fly. Air travel has added speed and cut down in travel time drastically. Today we can think of travelling around the world in 24 hours, which was never possible with any other type of transport.

Today air travel is a normal way to travel, for pleasure, personal need or business. 

Air travel can be broadly put into two groups; domestic flights, and international flights. 

Air travel within a country are called domestic flights. Most countries have domestic airlines to provide this service.

The air travel across the borders of countries are called international flights. This is generally long distance air travel.

<doc id="241009" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=241009" title="Gamma-Aminobutyric acid">
Gamma-Aminobutyric acid

"gamma"-Aminobutyric acid (γ-Aminobutyric acid, GABA) (IPA: [ˈgæmə əˈmiːnoʊbjuːˈtɪrɨk ˈæsɨd]) is a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of mammals. It is an "inhibiting" neurotransmitter. Normally, when a neuron receives an impulse, it will make the signal stronger. In the case where there is an "inhibiting" neurotransmitter, the cell will no longer get the impulse, and the signal as a whole will be weakened. 

In mammals, GABA regulates how much neurons in the central nervous system will be stimulated. In humans, GABA is also 
inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. It plays a role in regulating neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system. In humans, GABA is also directly responsible for the regulation of muscle tone. In insect species GABA acts only on excitatory nerve receptors.

Even though chemically it is an amino acid, GABA is rarely referred to as such in the scientific or medical communities. The term "amino acid," used without a qualifier, refers to the alpha amino acids, which GABA is not. GABA is also not incorporated into proteins.

In spastic diplegia in humans, GABA absorption by some nerves becomes impaired, which leads to hypertonia of the muscles signaled by those nerves.

Stroke (engine)

A stroke is the full single action of an engine to intake, compress, combust, and finally to exhaust a fuel. This action is typical of a 4-stroke engine. The combined action of intake, compression, combustion, exhaust, causes the shaft of the engine to spin. This action is repeated at a rate referred to as rpm's, revolutions per minute. The way "rpm's" are measured varies by the type of motor, and what "stroke" that motor is.

Ranks in the United States military

All branches of the US military have both Officers and Enlisted. Enlisted people with a rank of E-4 and above are called Non-commissioned Officers (NCOs). It is usually their job to make sure that common jobs are done properly every day. Each branch also includes "Warrant Officers" ("Chief Warrant Officers" in the Navy) . These were enlisted members who have been made officers. They are considered experts in their field, they are higher rank than other enlisted troops, but below officers. There are four ranks of Warrant Officers: WO-1 through WO-4 (CWO-1 to CWO-4)

Here are some common ranks for the US Army, Air Force and Marines. Each branch of the military uses different names for the enlisted ranks, but they all use the same for officers.

The Navy has different ranks.

Pyrite

The mineral pyrite, or iron pyrite, is an iron sulfide with the formula FeS. This mineral's metallic lustre and pale-to-normal, brass-yellow colour have earned it the nickname fool's gold because of its resemblance to gold. The term pyrite may also be used for some other sulphides such as copper sulphide.

Pyrite is the most common of the sulphide minerals. In ancient Roman times, this name was applied to several types of stone that would create sparks when struck against steel; Pliny the Elder described one of them as being brassy, almost certainly a reference to what we now call pyrite.
By Georgius Agricola's time, the term had become a generic term for all of the sulphide minerals.

Pyrite is usually found associated with other sulphides or oxides in quartz veins, sedimentary rock, and metamorphic rock, as well as in coal beds, and as a replacement mineral in fossils. Despite being nicknamed fool's gold, pyrite is sometimes found in association with small quantities of gold.

Dye-sublimation printer

A dye-sublimation printer (or dye-sub printer) is a high quality computer printer that uses heat to make coloured images.
The ink is held on cellophane sheets that are the same size as the paper. A 6" x 4" printer would use 6" x 4" ink sheets. Each image uses 4 sheets - 3 ink sheets Cyan, Magenta and Yellow and a clear sheet.

Each sheet of ink is printed one at a time. So making an image takes a long time.

The images are very high quality. They waste a lot of ink. This means that the prints are very expensive.

Hellhound

A hellhound is a supernatural dog, found in mythology, folklore and fiction. It is said to be quite a bit larger than a normal dog. Many ominous or hellish supernatural dogs are in mythology around the world, similar to the ubiquitous dragon. Hellhounds are often said to have black fur, glowing red or sometimes glowing yellow eyes, super strength or speed, ghostly or phantom characteristics, a badodor, and sometimes even the ability to talk. In cultures that think that there is fire in the afterlife, hellhounds may have fire-based abilities and appearance. They often have to guard the entrances to the world of the dead, such as graveyards and burial grounds, or do other things related to the afterlife or the supernatural. These might be hunting down lost souls or guarding a supernatural treasure. In European legends, seeing a hellhound or hearing it howl may be either an omen or a cause of a soon death.

Astrocytoma

An Astroctytoma is a form of a brain tumor that comes from astrocytes (a type of brain cell). While many low-grade astrocytomas can be effectively treated with surgery alone, with some reports indicating rates of five year survival of up to 90%. Pilocytic astrocytomas are even more indolent, with excellent survival rates. On the other hand, high-grade astrocytomas such as Anaplastic astrocytoma have worse prognoses. Temozolomide is approved for the treatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma.

Young Concert Artists Trust

The Young Concert Artists Trust, usually called YCAT (pronounced like "why cat?") is a trust which organizes competitions for young musicians in the United Kingdom who play classical music.

Young musicians can apply to take part in the competition (in 2010 there were 120 applicants). There are two rounds to select the best of them, and a final competition which takes place in a concert hall in front of an audience. The winners get the chance to play in several concerts and recitals in famous concert halls such as the Wigmore Hall and Purcell Room in London and the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester.

YCAT was founded in 1984 by Michael Kaye. The competitions have been held now for 25 years. It can be won by individual people (one person) or by small chamber groups.

The YCAT gets its money from organizations and individual people who give money to it.

In 2010 YCAT celebrates its 25th anniversary with two gala concerts at the Wigmore Hall. YCAT award winners from previous years will be playing together with the YCAT winners of today.

YCAT winners over the years have included the Belcea Quartet, Leopold String Trio, the violist Philip Dukes, cellist Li-Wei Qin, double bassist Dominic Seldis and violinists So-Ock Kim,Laurent Korcia and Thomas Gould.

<doc id="241584" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=241584" title="Satyagraha">
Satyagraha

Satyagraha ( "satyāgraha") is the idea of nonviolent resistance (fighting with peace) started by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (also known as "Mahatma" Gandhi). Gandhi used "satyagraha" in the Indian independence movement and also during his earlier struggle in South Africa. "Satyagraha" helped shape Nelson Mandela's struggle in South Africa under apartheid, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s campaigns during the civil rights movement in the United States, and many other similar movements. Someone who does "satyagraha" is a satyagrahi.

The word "Satyagraha" is from the Sanskrit words "satya" (meaning "truth") and "Agraha" ("insistence", or "holding firmly to"). For Gandhi, "Satyagraha" went far beyond just "passive resistance" (resisting without taking action). His non-violence also became his strength. He said that he chose the name because Truth means Love, and Insistence means Force, and the Sanskrit name showed it was a force born from Truth and Love (non-violence).

He also wrote that he liked the term "Civil Resistance" better than "Civil disobedience". Gandhi also translated it as "love force" or "soul force". 

In most conflict, the goal is to defeat the enemy, to stop him from meeting his goal, or to meet a goal that the enemy is trying to stop. But in "satyagraha", these are not the goals. The goal, Gandhi said, is to change the mind of the wrong-doer, not to force him. Winning means getting along with the enemy to make what is wrong right again, which they might not realize is wrong. For this to happen, the enemy's mind must change to realize that he is stopping a goal that is right.

Gandhi asked those who did satyagraha (called "satyagrahis") to follow these rules:


Another time, Gandhi gave seven important rules: A satyagrahi:

Cycad

Cycads are seed plants whose fossils are first found in the early Permian period. 

They were very common in the Mesozoic era, the age of the dinosaurs, and are still living, but are now much less common.

They are different from most plants because they have large crowns of compound leaves and a stout trunk. They are evergreen, dioecious plants having large pinnately compound leaves. 

They are frequently confused with and mistaken for palms or ferns, but are only distantly related to both, and instead belong to the division Cycadophyta.

Pluto

Pluto is the second-largest dwarf planet in the Solar System. It is smaller than the largest known dwarf planet, Eris. Its formal name is 134340 Pluto. The dwarf planet is the tenth-largest body that moves around the Sun. At first, Pluto was called a planet. Now, it is considered the largest of the bodies in the Kuiper belt.

Like other members of the Kuiper belt, Pluto is mainly made of rock and ice. It is quite small. It is about a fifth (1/5) of the weight of the Earth's Moon. It is only a third (1/3) its volume. It has an odd orbit and This orbit is very sloped. It takes Pluto to 30 to 49 AU (4.4–7.4 billion km) from the Sun. This causes Pluto to sometimes go closer to the Sun than Neptune. 

Since it was discovered in 1930, Pluto was thought to be the Solar System's ninth planet. In the late 1970s, the minor planet 2060 Chiron was found and people learned that Pluto had a small mass. They asked why it was a major planet from then on because it was really small.
Later, in the early 21st century, the scattered disc object Eris and other objects like Pluto were discovered. Eris is 27% more massive than Pluto. On August 24, 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) gave a definition to the word "planet" for the first time. By this definition, Pluto was not a planet anymore. It became a "dwarf planet" along with Eris and Ceres. After this, Pluto was put on the list of minor planets. It was given the number 134340. A number of scientists continue to hold that Pluto should be classified as a planet.

Pluto and its largest moon, Charon, are sometimes called a "binary system". This is because the barycentre of their orbits does not lie within them. The IAU has yet to formalise a definition for binary dwarf planets, and until it passes such a ruling, they classify Charon as a moon of Pluto. Pluto has three known smaller moons, Nix and Hydra, discovered in 2005, and another, as yet unnamed, discovered in 2011.

In the 1840s, using Newtonian mechanics, Urbain Le Verrier predicted the planet Neptune existed. He discovered this after studying the orbit of Uranus. Neptune was seen later in the late 19th century. Astronomers then felt that Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet. In 1906, Percival Lowell, a person from Boston began an extensive to search the ninth planet. He called it "Planet X". By 1909, Lowell and William H. Pickering had suggested many possible places in the Solar System where the planet could be. Lowell continued the research till 1916. However, it fetched no good result. On March 19, 1915, his observatory had captured two images of Pluto. Lowell did not know this. The pictures was not recognized then for what it was.

Constance Lowell, Percival's widow had a ten-year long legal battle for Percival's estate. For this reason, the search for Planet X again started in 1929. The director of the mission, Vesto Melvin Slipher, gave the job to Clyde Tombaugh, a 23-year-old Kansas man. Tombaugh had just come at the Lowell Observatory. Slipher had been impressed by his astronomical drawings.

Tombaugh's had to systematically get pictures of the night sky in pairs every two weeks. Then, he had to look at each pair. This was to know whether any object had shifted. He used a machine called a blink comparator. He quickly shifted between the different views of each of the plates. This helped him to see whether any object had changed their position. On February 18, 1930, Tombaugh discovered an object which seemed to move from the photographic plates taken on January 23 and January 29 of the year. Another picture taken on January 21 confirmed this. After the observatory did more research about it, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930.
The discovery made headlines across the Earth. The Lowell Observatory had the right to name the new object. They received over 1000 suggestions from all over the world. Some proposed Atlas as the name. Others wanted to name it Zymal. Tombaugh urged Slipher to suggest a name for the new object quickly before someone else did. Constance Lowell proposed "Zeus," then "Lowell," and finally Constance. These suggestions were not used.

The name Pluto was proposed by Venetia Burney (later Venetia Phair). She was an 11-year-old schoolgirl in Oxford, England then. Venetia was interested in classical mythology and astronomy. The name was of the Roman god of the underworld. She thought it was a good name for a dark and cold world. She suggested it when she was talking with her grandfather Falconer Madan. He was a former librarian at the University of Oxford's Bodleian Library. Madan passed the name to Professor Herbert Hall Turner. Turner told this proposed name to the astronomers in the United States.

The object was officially named on March 24, 1930. Each member of the Lowell Observatory was allowed to vote on a short-list of three names. The names were Minerva (which was already the name for an asteroid), Cronus, and Pluto. Pluto received all votes. The name was announced on May 1, 1930. Upon the announcement, Madan gave Venetia five pounds as a reward.

Alessandro Scarlatti

Alessandro Scarlatti (born Palermo, 2 May 1660; died 24 October 1725) was an Italian composer. He lived in the Baroque period. He is especially famous for his operas and chamber cantatas. He is thought of as the founder of the Neapolitan school of opera. He was the father of the famous composer Domenico Scarlatti.

Scarlatti was born in Palermo. At that time it was part of the Kingdom of Sicily. We know nothing about his musical education. When his opera "Gli Equivoci nell sembiante" was produced in Rome in 1679 the Queen of Sweden, who was living in Rome at the time, was very impressed and gave him the job of being her Maestro di cappella. In February 1684 he became Maestro di Cappella to the viceroy of Naples. He wrote many operas for him, as well as some music for important state occasions. 

In 1702 Scarlatti left Naples and went to Florence where he composed operas for Ferdinando de' Medici and for Cardinal Ottoboni, who made him his "maestro di cappella". In 1703 he also got a similar job in Rome at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. 

After visiting Venice and Urbino in 1707, Scarlatti went back to Naples in 1708, and stayed there until 1717. However, the audiences in Naples no longer seemed interested in his music. They liked their serious operas to include comic music. Some of his best operas were written for Rome where they were produced at the Teatro Capranica. He also wrote some church music and music for royal weddings. He died in Naples.

Scarlatti's music forms an important link between the early Baroque Italian vocal styles of the 17th century and the classical period of the 18th century, which led to the music of Haydn and Mozart. 

Perhaps his greatest work is "Mitridate Eupatore". Many of his later operas are full of music which allows the singers to show off. In his opera "Teodora" (1697) he was the first composer to use the orchestral "ritornello" (a tune which keeps coming back after sections of solo singing). 

Some of his later operas written for Rome make the orchestra sound much more modern. He uses horns in the orchestra. This was a new idea.

As well as operas, Scarlatti composed at least five hundred chamber-cantatas. These are works for solo voice accompanied by orchestra. Hardly any of them were published, but they contain a lot of good music.

He also wrote masses including the "St Cecilia Mass" (1721).

Hurricane Elena was a category 3 major hurricane that caused heavy damage along the Gulf Coast of the United States in August and September of the 1985 Atlantic hurricane season.

Elena's unusual path through the Gulf of Mexico, which included a loop, caused many people to evacuate from the coastline.

Before Hurricane Elena, there was a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on August 23. It remained weak due to its fast westward motion and Saharan Air Layer around the circulation. As it moved through the Greater Antilles, it slowed and a tropical depression formed on August 28 between Cuba and Haiti. It paralleled the northern cost of Cuba, and became Tropical Storm Elena that night. Conditions were good for the storm to develop in the Gulf of Mexico, and Elena became a hurricane on the 29th.

The MICR is a device that can recognise human readable characters printed on documents such as cheques using a special magnetic ink. The reader reads these characters by examining their shapes. Characters are printed in a special font. Each character is formed by a 7 x 10 matrix. The MICR has a magnetic head which can detect the magnetic patern for each character.

The abbreviation MICR stands for Magnetic Ink Character Recognition. This is a type of data input often found in banks. The bank account number and other details are printed onto bank cheques (USA - checks)in a special font with magnetic ink.

The magnetic characters can be read very quickly and accurately by MICR readers. This means that cheques can be processed much more quickly

Italian irredentism in Istria

Italian irredentism in Istria was the political movement dedicated to the unification of Istria to Italy.

When Napoleon defeated Venice in 1797 found that Istria was populated by Italians on the coast and in the main cities, but the interior was populated mainly by Croats and Slovenians. 

This dual ethnicity in the same peninsula created a situation of antagonism between Slavs and Italians for the supremacy of Istria, when started the first nationalisms after Napoleon's fall.

Since 1815 Istria was a part of the Austrian monarchy, and Croats/Slovenians and Italians engaged in a nationalistic feud with each other.

As a consequence Istria has been the theater of an ethnic struggle between them, with bloody nationalistic wars, during the XIX and XX centuries. The Italian irredentism was actively followed by many Italians in Istria (called Istrian Italians), like the Italian hero Nazario Sauro of Capodistria (actual Koper).

Indeed, between 1918 and 1947 Istria was part of the Kingdom of Italy, but after WWII was part of Yugoslavia. Now the Istrian Italians are reduced to a small minority, who has survived the Istrian exodus and the Foibe massacres during and after WWII. 

Furthermore, after the war was created the "Free Territory of Trieste" in north-western Istria: in the years following the division of the territory between Italy and Yugoslavia, up to 40,000 Istrian Italians chose to leave the Yugoslav "B zone" and move to the "A zone" or Italy for various reasons - some were intimidated into leaving and some simply preferred not to live in Tito's Yugoslavia.

Since the end of WWII the irredentism has totally disappeared in Istria, even because of the Istrian exodus.

Actually Istria is populated mainly by Slavs, but nearly 50,000 Italians still live there (divided between the areas of Istria belonging to Croatia, Slovenia and Italy).

Capodistria (actual Koper) and Muggia were the centers of the irredentism in Istria. In these cities there was the main "Comitato istriano" (Istrian Committee for Union to Italy), the meeting place of the most famous istrian irredentists like Carlo Combi e Antonio Madonizza. From there sailed in 1848 many Istrian Italians to fight for Venice against the Austrians with the Legione Istriano-dalmata.

After 1866 -when Venice and the Veneto region were united to Italy- in all Istria there was full support for the irredentism. The Italian hero Nazario Sauro was born in Capodistria. 

Actually only Muggia remains Italian, as part of the Province of Trieste.

Perestroika, which means "restructuring" in the Russian language, was a series of changes to the economy of the Soviet Union. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev started it in 1986. This happened only a few years before the Soviet Union fell apart into 15 countries. Many historians argue that it was a major reason that the Soviet Union fell apart. It happened at about the same time as Gorbachev's "glasnost" reforms, which made what the government did not as much of a secret.

The Soviet Union was a communist country. The government controlled the economy. People did not own their own land or businesses. Under perestroika, some people could even start to own their own businesses. Gorbachev wanted perestroika to help out the Soviet economy, which had been having problems. However, in the end, it could not save the country's economy.

Gettysburg, Pennsylvania

Gettysburg is a borough in and the county seat of Adams County, Pennsylvania, United States. There were about 7,490 people at the 2000 United States census (counting of the people).

It is known mostly because it is near to where the Battle of Gettysburg was held. Lincoln gave the Gettysburg Address at Gettysburg. It is seen as one of the most historic sites in American history. Dwight Eisenhower lived at Gettysburg in his later years. 

However, it is also known for the Lutheran Theological Seminary, founded in 1826, Gettysburg College (originally Pennsylvania College), which began operating in 1832, and
Harrisburg Area Community College.

Many roads come from Gettysburg. It is at the junction of U.S. Route 15, U.S. Route 30 (the Lincoln Highway). Today it is a 2½ hour drive from Philadelphia. It is also a 3½ hour drive from Pittsburgh by the Pennsylvania Turnpike and U.S. Route 15. Gettysburg Regional Airport, a small general aviation airport, is west of Gettysburg. Gettysburg has weather that changes from around in the winter months to almost in the summer.

Gettysburg National Cemetery

Gettysburg National Cemetery is on Cemetery Hill in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. A short time after the Battle of Gettysburg the place was bought. The Union dead were moved from shallow (not deep) burial places on the battlefield to the cemetery. It was supported by Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin. The local attorney David Wills was the person who mostly bought the land, managed the building of the cemetery, and planned its ceremony. However, the basic concept and early organizing efforts were led by rival lawyer David McConaughy. The landscape architect William Saunders designed the cemetery. It was called the "Soldiers' National Cemetery at Gettysburg" at first.

It was dedicated on November 19, 1863. Edward Everett mostly spoke at the ceremony. However, it was here that Abraham Lincoln delivered the famous Gettysburg Address.

3,512 Union soldiers were buried in the cemetery. 979 are unknown.

M&Ms are round chocolates with an “m” printed on each one. They are available in many different colors. These colors are green, yellow, blue, red, brown, and orange. They also come in different flavors such as milk chocolate, dark chocolate, mint chocolate, peanuts, almonds, orange chocolate, coconut, and peanut butter. M&Ms have also been included in many other candy products. 

Forrest Mars is the founder of the Mars Company. He got the idea for M&M’s during the 1930 Spanish Civil War. He saw soldiers eating chocolate pellets with hard chocolate shells. He decided to make his own chocolate candies. He got the patent for these on March 3, 1941. 
The name M&M comes from the founders name Forrest E. Mars Sr. The other M comes from the name of the president of the Hershey Company, William F. R. Murrie. The Mars Company started printing the white M on the candy in 1950.
In 1954 the world famous M&M characters made their first television appearance. In 1980 M&M’s were sold across the world.

Brown Labrador

The Labrador (also Labrador or Lab for short) is one of several kinds of retriever, a type of gun dog. They have webbed paws for swimming, useful when they retrieve their prey, hence the name retriever. The Labrador, once known as the Lesser Newfoundland, is the most popular breed of dog (by registered ownership) in the world. It is by a large margin the most popular breed by registration in Canada, the United States (since 1991), and the United Kingdom.

The Brown Labrador breed does not come from Labrador. These dogs were bred on the coast of Newfoundland in the 17th century. They were trained to bring in the fishing-nets from the icy waters for the fishermen. In the early 19th century, they were brought to Poole Harbor in Great Britain. These dogs had short strong legs and were good swimmers. Their coats were thick and they had a broad tail. Englishmen had many offers to buy them from fishermen because they were so attractive. The breed was instantly successful as a gundog. The Master of Malmesbury (an English lord) was interested and amazed by these dogs, known at that time as Saint John's breed of water dogs and he started breeding them, calling them Labrador dogs. A heavy dog tax in Canada and the new isolation laws in Great Britain caused a great reduction in the breed, limiting further breeding to be done without any more imports.

Brown Labradors are intelligent dogs. Labradors are easily trained, making them good for use in field sports, obeying competitions, as search dogs, as guide dogs and as hearing dogs. These dogs take a great pleasure in any of these activities.

Cosmic rays

Cosmic rays are particles that hit Earth and come from outer space. Most of these particles are protons, some are the insides of helium (alpha particles), some are electrons (beta particles), gamma rays or photons and a tiny fraction are even heavier particles.

Some of these particles come from things that happen in the Sun and some come from all the way from unknown events in the farthest away parts of the universe. Cosmic rays can have as much energy as 1020 eV, far higher than the 1012 to 1013 eV that man-made particle accelerators can produce. 

When cosmic ray particles enter the Earth's atmosphere they hit other particles, particles like oxygen and nitrogen. they then split apart into a shower of lighter particles, a so-called air shower.

The number of particles made in an air shower event can reach billions. All of the particles in the shower stay within about one degree of the first particle's path. Lots of different particles are made in collisions like this but lots of the time there are charged mesons (e.g. positive and negative pions and kaons). Cosmic rays are also the reason for the why we usually have a number of unstable isotopes in the Earth that doesn't change much even though those isotopes break into other elements. a good example is carbon-14, we always have the same number of carbon 14 particles because some cosmic rays react with elements like carbon-14 and make them unstable.

In rail transport, a retarder is a device put in a classification yard used to slow down the speed of freight cars as they are sorted into trains. Each retarder has a series of stationary brakes around a short section of each rail on the track that hold and slow the cars' wheels through friction as they roll through them. Modern retarders are computer worked to have the perfect amount of pressure on the wheels so that cars rolling down a yard's hump are slowed to a safe speed for coupling with cars already standing on the yard's tracks.

Janeite

The word Janeite has been used by people who love the works of Jane Austen. However, it can also be used to show disapproval. Claudia Johnson says that "Janeitism" is "the self-consciously idolatrous enthusiasm (love) for 'Jane' and every detail relative to her (about her)".

Janeitism did not begin until after J. E. Austen-Leigh published "A Memoir of Jane Austen" in 1870. When this was published, Jane Austen became much more popular. This worried the literary elite. They felt they had to separate their liking of Austen from the "masses". The word "Janeite" was first begun by the literary scholar George Saintsbury in his 1894 introduction to a new edition of "Pride and Prejudice". Austen scholar Deidre Lynch explains, "he meant to equip himself with a badge of honor he could jubilantly (triumphantly, happily) pin". In the early twentieth century, Janeitism was "principally (mostly) a male enthusiasm shared among publishers, professors, and literati". Rudyard Kipling even printed a short story called "Janeites" about a group of World War I soldiers who were fans of Austen's novels. 

In the 1930s and 1940s,Austen's works were accepted at school, and the word began to change its meaning. It began to mean the people who liked Austen in the "wrong" way. The word, according to Lynch, is now " and against "other" people".

Histone

Histones are proteins found in eukaryotic cell nuclei, which package the DNA into structural units called nucleosomes. They are the chief protein components of chromatin, the active component of chromosomes. 

Histones act as spools around which DNA winds, and play a role in gene regulation. Without histones, the unwound DNA in chromosomes would be very long. For example, each human cell has about 1.8 meters of DNA, but wound on the histones it has about 90 millimeters of chromatin, which, when duplicated and condensed during mitosis, result in about 120 micrometers of chromosomes.

Histones act as spools around which DNA winds. This packs in the large genomes of eukaryotes to fit inside cell nuclei. The compacted molecule is 40,000 times shorter than an unpacked molecule.

Histones undergo changes which alter their interaction with DNA and nuclear proteins. Long-term changes in histone/DNA interaction cause epigenetic efects. Combinations of modifications are thought to constitute a code, the so-called "histone code". Histone modifications act in diverse biological processes such as gene regulation, DNA repair and chromosome condensation (mitosis).

Examples of histone modifications in transcription regulation include:

Histones were discovered in 1884 by Albrecht Kossel. The word "histone" dates from the late 19th century and is from the German "Histon", of uncertain origin: perhaps from Greek "histanai" or from "histos". Until the early 1990s, histones were dismissed as merely packing material for nuclear DNA. During the early 1990s, the regulatory functions of histones were discovered.

The discovery of the H5 histone appears to date back to 1970's.

Histones are found in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells, and in certain Archaea, namely Euryarchaea, but not in bacteria. Histone proteins are among the most highly conserved proteins in eukaryotes, which suggests they are vital to the biology of the nucleus. In contrast, mature sperm cells largely use protamines to package their genomic DNA, most likely to achieve an even higher packaging ratio.

Core histones are highly conserved proteins, that is, there are very few differences among the amino acid sequences of the histone proteins of different species. Linker histone usually has more than one form within a species and is also less conserved than the core histones.

Substrate (biochemistry)

In biochemistry, a substrate is the molecule acted on by an enzyme to produce a product.

The general equation for an enzyme reaction is:

An example: Sucrase, 400 times the size of its substrate sucrose, splits the sucrose into its constituent sugars, which are glucose and fructose. The sucrase bends the sucrose, and strains the bond between the glucose and fructose. Water molecules join in and make the cleavage in a fraction of a second.

Fatty acid

In organic chemistry and biochemistry, a fatty acid is a carboxylic acid (-C(=O)OH), with a long unbranched hydrocarbon tail. It may be either saturated or unsaturated. Unsaturated compounds have reactive double bonds; saturated ones do not.
Fatty acids are aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from, or contained in, an animal or vegetable fat, oil, or wax. Natural fatty acids commonly have a chain of four to 28 carbon atoma (usually unbranched and even numbered), which may be saturated or unsaturated. This would include acetic acid, although this is not usually considered a fatty acid (not a lipid). 

The blend of fatty acids exuded by mammalian skin, together with lactic acid and pyruvic acid, are distinctive, and enable animals with a keen sense of smell to differentiate individuals.

Repetitive strain injury

Repetitive strain injury (RSI), also known as occupational overuse syndrome, is a medical condition affecting the muscles and nervous system. It is usually caused by doing the same thing repeatedly or without breaks. Using a computer for long periods of time is a common way of causing this problem. 

Repetitive strain injury is described as a sudden, intense pain in affected parts of the body, often the wrists, neck, back or hands, that keeps coming back. It is different from more specific diagnoses, because RSI does not have an easily found cause. The pain is often spread across different muscle groups and inspection of the affected area usually cannot show any differences from that of a healthy person. Because of this, treatment for RSI is usually limited to rest and exercises, and sometimes wearing a brace.

<doc id="242104" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242104" title="Debt consolidation">
Debt consolidation

Debt consolidation involves taking out a loan to pay off multiple loans. This is usually done to secure a lower interest rate and for the convenience of paying only one loan.

Debt consolidation usually entails taking a secured loan against an assets, such as a house and using this to pay off higher interest unsecured loads and credit card debts. However this puts the individuals assets at risk if they do not keep up payment.

Sometimes, debt consolidation companies can discount the amount of the loan. When the debtor is in danger of bankruptcy, the debt consolidator will buy the loan at a discount. A prudent debtor can shop around for consolidators who will pass along some of the savings. Consolidation can affect the ability of the debtor to discharge debts in bankruptcy, so the decision to consolidate must be weighed carefully.

Metastatic melanoma

Metastatic melanoma is Melanoma that has metastasized (spread beyond the initial primary tumor). It is treated with Dacarbizine or Interleukin-2, also known as Proleukin, in many cases. Interleukin-2 has a response rate of up to sixteen-percent. Recent studies support the use of a new drug called Ipilimumab, which appears to prolong survival in metastatic melanoma patients. Percutaneous liver perfusion with a chemotherapeutic agent known as melphalan can prolong progression free survival in patients with melanoma metastatic to the liver, although the majority of patients in this study had melanoma starting in the eye rather than the skin.

Late Heavy Bombardment

The Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) or lunar cataclysm, is a period of time approximately 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago (Ga) during which a large number of impact craters are believed to have formed on the Moon, and by inference on Earth, Mercury, Venus, and Mars as well.

The evidence for this event comes from the dating of lunar samples, which indicates that most impact melt rocks formed at that time. Many hypotheses have been suggested to explain how asteroidal or cometary material got into the inner solar system, no consensus yet exists. One popular theory is that the gas giant planets migrated in orbit at this time, causing objects in the asteroid belt and/or Kuiper belt to be forced into orbits which reached the terrestrial planets. 

Some argue that the lunar sample data do not require a cataclysmic cratering event near 3.9 Ga. They think the apparent clustering of impact melt ages near this time is an artifact of sampling.

Malignant tumors like Anaplastic astrocytoma and Glioblastoma multiforme, however, require more aggressive therapy. For Glioblastoma multiforme, surgical removal of the tumor followed by radiotherapy is used. Temozolomide (also known as temodar) is also used for gliomas (including Glioblastoma multiforme).

Benzodiazepine

Benzodiazepines are organic chemical substances, made of two rings. Certain benzodiazepines can be used as drugs that increase the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA. The resulting drug has sedative effects. Depending on the drug, the effect may be stronger or weaker. The first benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide (Librium), was discovered accidentally by Leo Sternbach in 1955, and made available in 1960 by Hoffmann–La Roche.

In general taking benzodiazepines is safe and effective in the short term. Longer term use is controversial: In the long term, the drug may become less effective, and problems of dependency may show. 

Benzodiazepines may not be safe to be taken during pregnancy. They are not teratogens, but they may cause cleft palate in a small number of babies.Benzodiazepines can be taken in overdoses and can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness. However, they are much less toxic than the drugs they replaced, the barbiturates. Death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken. When combined with other central nervous system depressants such as alcohol and opiates, the potential for toxicity increases. Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse.

Edward Everett

Edward Everett (April 11, 1794 January 15, 1865) was an American politician, religious leader and educator from Massachusetts. He was a Whig. He served as U.S. Representative, and U.S. Senator, the 15th Governor of Massachusetts, Minister to Great Britain, and United States Secretary of State. He also taught at Harvard University and was as president of Harvard. He was the Vice-Presidential candidate of the Constitutional Union Party in 1860. He gave a long speech at Gettysburg right before Abraham Lincoln.

When Abraham Lincoln became president, the Civil War broke out. Everett had been calmer about slavery, but he was a strong Unionist. He worked hard to raise support for the Union through speaking in public. In November 1863, when the military cemetery at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania was dedicated, Everett was the main speaker. His two-hour speech was before the much shorter, but now more famous Gettysburg Address by President Lincoln. Everett was moved by the short speech and wrote to Lincoln, "I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion, in two hours, as you did in two minutes."

<doc id="242394" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242394" title="NBA Draft">
NBA Draft

The NBA Draft happens every year in June. It is where teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA) choose players who have never played in the NBA before. If a team chooses a player, that player cannot sign a contract to play for any teams other than that team.

Players must be at least 19 years old at some point during the year of the draft. If the player's 19th birthday will be the next year, they are too young. If a player is from the United States, it must be at least one year after the graduation of his high school class. Some players who are star players go to college and play college basketball for just one year (because they cannot enter the draft right out of high school), then enter the NBA Draft. These players are called "one and dones". Other players enter the draft after two or three years in college, and other players are drafted after playing in college for all four years that they can.

If a player has not played in college for four years, they must enter the NBA Draft by declaring themselves eligible. 

Teams take turns choosing players. When a team chooses a player, it is called a "pick". For example, if a player is the second player chosen, people will say that he was taken with the second pick in the draft. There are two rounds in the draft. Both rounds have 30 picks, so there are 60 picks in the whole draft. Each team gets one pick per round, but sometimes, a team will pick more than once in a round or not at all. This is because teams can trade draft picks for players, for money, or for other draft picks.

The NBA allows teams who had worse records (which means that they won fewer games) the previous season to pick before better teams. This lets bad teams draft good players and become better. The first fourteen teams to pick are the fourteen teams that did not make the playoffs the previous season. (There are thirty teams in the NBA, and sixteen teams qualify for the playoffs every year, so fourteen teams do not.) The teams that do not make the playoffs and who get picks 15 through 30 in the first round pick in reverse order of how good their records were (so the best team gets the 30th pick, the second best team gets the 29th pick, and so on). However, the first fourteen picks are given out differently so that teams will not lose games on purpose to get higher picks. These picks are given to teams in a process called the "Draft Lottery".

Since 1985, all teams that have missed the playoffs have participated in a lottery system to see who gets the first pick. The lottery system has changed a few times since then, but the system that the NBA uses right now uses ping pong balls that have numbers written on them. A machine picks four balls at a time, and every possible combination of numbers is assigned to a team. Teams with worse records get more combinations of numbers, which means that they have a better chance to win. The machine picks three teams, and these teams get the first three picks in the draft. The other eleven teams will pick in order of how bad their records are, so the worst team that was not selected will pick fourth, and so on.

Many star NBA players who helped their teams a lot were selected early in the NBA Draft. For example, with the first pick in the 1997 NBA Draft, the San Antonio Spurs chose Tim Duncan. Duncan would help the San Antonio Spurs win several NBA Championships. Other star players who were chosen with the first pick are Shaquille O'Neal (chosen by the Orlando Magic in 1992), Dwight Howard (chosen by the Magic in 2004), and LeBron James (chosen by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003. However, not all players who have been chosen with the first pick have gone on to become star players. Some players have not had as much success as the teams who drafted them expected, and have been called "draft busts". A few players chosen with the first pick who have been called "draft busts" include Joe Smith (chosen by the Los Angeles Clippers in 1995), Michael Olowokandi (chosen by the Clippers in 1998), and Kwame Brown (chosen by the Washington Wizards in 2001.)

<doc id="242398" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242398" title="Radiometric dating">
Radiometric dating

Radiometric dating (often called radioactive dating) is a technique used to date materials. The method compares the amount of a naturally occurring radioactive isotope and its decay products, in samples. The method uses known decay rates. 

It is the main source of information about the age of rocks and other geological features, including the age of the Earth itself. It may be used to date a wide range of natural and man-made materials. Fossils may be dated by taking samples of suitable rocks from strata above and below the fossil's original position. Radiometric dating is also used to date archaeological materials, including ancient artifacts.

Radiometric dating methods are used to establish the geological time scale. Among the best-known techniques are radiocarbon dating, potassium-argon dating and uranium-lead dating. 

All ordinary matter is made up of combinations of chemical elements, each with its own atomic number, indicating the number of protons in the atomic nucleus. Elements exist in different isotopes, with each isotope of an element differing in the number of neutrons in the nucleus. A particular isotope of a particular element is called a nuclide. Some nuclides are inherently unstable. That is, at some point in time, an atom of such a nuclide will spontaneously transform into a different nuclide. This transformation may occur in various ways, including radioactive decay, either by emission of particles (usually electrons (beta decay), positrons or alpha particles) or by spontaneous nuclear fission, and electron capture.

The mathematical expression that relates radioactive decay to geologic time is: 

where

The above equation makes use of information on the composition of parent and daughter isotopes at the time the material solidified. This is well-known for most isotopic systems. Plotting an isochron (straight-line graph) is used to solve the age equation graphically and calculate the age of the sample and the original composition.
The method requires that neither the parent nuclide nor the daughter product can enter or leave the material after its formation. Anything which changes the relative amounts of the two isotopes (original and daughter) must be noted, and avoided if possible. Contamination from outside, or the loss of isotopes at any time from the rock's original formation, would change the result. It is therefore essential to have as much information as possible about the material being dated and to check for possible signs of alteration. 

Measurements should be taken on multiple samples from different parts of the rock body. This helps to counter the effects of heating and squeezing, which a rock may exoerience in its long history. Using different dating methods may be required to confirm the age of a sample. For example, a study of the Amitsoq gneisses from western Greenland used five different radiometric dating methods to examine twelve samples and achieved agreement to within 30 million years on an age of 3,640my.

K–Ar dating

Potassium–Argon dating or K–Ar dating is a radiometric dating method used in geochronology and archaeology. It is based on measurement of the product of the radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium (K) into argon (Ar). 

Potassium is a common element found in many materials, such as micas, clay, tephra, and evaporites. In these materials, the decay product Ar is able to escape the liquid (molten) rock, but starts to accumulate when the rock solidifies (recrystallises). Time since recrystallization is calculated by measuring the ratio of the amount of Ar accumulated to the amount of K remaining. The long half-life of K allows the method to be used to calculate the absolute age of samples older than a few thousand years
The quickly cooled lavas that make nearly ideal samples for K–Ar dating also preserve a record of the direction and intensity of the local magnetic field as the sample cooled past the Curie point of iron. The geomagnetic polarity time scale was calibrated largely using K–Ar dating.

<doc id="242441" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242441" title="Uranium-lead dating">
Uranium-lead dating

Uranium-lead is one of the oldest and most refined of the radiometric dating schemes. 

It can be used over an age range of about 1 million years to over 4.5 billion years. Precision is in the 0.1-1 percent range. 

The method relies on two separate decay chains, the uranium series from U to Pb, with a half-life of 4.47 billion years and the actinium series from U to Pb, with a half-life of 704 million years.

The existence of two 'parallel' uranium-lead decay routes allows several dating techniques within the overall U-Pb system. 

The term 'U-Pb dating' normally implies the coupled use of both decay schemes. However, use of a single decay scheme (usually U to Pb) leads to the U-Pb isochron dating method, analogous to the rubidium-strontium dating method. 

Finally, ages can also be determined from the U-Pb system by analysis of Pb isotope ratios alone. This is termed the lead-lead dating method. Clair Cameron Patterson, an American geochemist who pioneered studies of uranium-lead radiometric dating methods, is famous for having used it to obtain one of the earliest accurate estimates of the age of the Earth.

Uranium-lead dating is usually performed on the mineral zircon (ZrSiO), though it can be used on other minerals. Zircon incorporates uranium and thorium atoms into its crystalline structure, but strongly rejects lead. Therefore we can assume that the entire lead content of the zircon is radiogenic. Where this is not the case, a correction must be applied. Uranium-lead dating techniques have also been applied to other minerals such as calcite/aragonite and other carbonate minerals. These minerals often produce lower precision ages than igneous and metamorphic minerals traditionally used for age dating, but are more common in the geologic record.

The newest version is Game Maker 8. Since the first version made in 1999, Game Maker was given many new features. One of these features is 3-D graphics.

Game Maker has a drag-and-drop interface. This lets people make games using mostly the computer mouse. Game Maker uses icons that tell the person what actions they can do. People can make simple games by moving these icons into a given order. More detailed games can be made when Game Maker Language is used.

Game Maker has an internet community and website. There, people who use Game Maker can put their games up for others to play. People can also get help on using Game Maker from other people.

Game Maker started as an animation program called "Animo". Each new version of Game Maker added many new features. Starting with version 7.0, Game Maker was published by the YoYo Games company.

<doc id="242516" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242516" title="Imhotep">
Imhotep

Imhotep was a high priest in ancient Egypt, and had many other important skills. He was born in Ankhtowe on the 16th day of Epiphi. Epiphi is the third month of the Egyptian harvest season. His mother was Khreduonkh and father was Kanofer an architect. Imhotep also became famous as an architect. After his death, because of his attachment with the god Ptah during his work at Ptah's temple stories were spread that said that Ptah was his father. As a god he was often pictured seated, wearing a long kilt robe and a skull cap or a shaven head. He had a papyrus scroll spread on his lap to show his scholarly nature and scribal assistance. 

As an architect Imhotep was most famous because he was the designer of the step pyramid. Before the step pyramid, pharaohs were buried in flat topped structures called mastabas. The term mastaba comes from the word meaning bench because they look like the benches most Egyptians placed outside their door. An average mastaba had four walls, a flat top and an underground burial chamber, reached by a vertical shaft or stairwell. There were also a couple of small rooms above the burial chambers containing various items for the afterlife. The step pyramid was actually just a number of mastabas placed one on top of the other, each one smaller than the previous one. 

Imhotep’s best-known writings were medical scrolls. He is thought to have written the Edwin Smith papyrus. The papyrus consists of 48 injuries of which 27 are head trauma, and six are spine trauma. Here’s an example for treatment of a head injury:
“Examination: If thou examinest a man having a wound in his head, while his wound does not have two lips, penetrating to the bone of his skull , (but) not having a gash, thou shouldst palpate his wound (or, thou shouldst lay thy hand upon it); shouldst thou find his skull uninjured, not having a perforation; a split, or a smash in it. Treatment: Thou shouldst bind it with fresh meat the first day (and) treat afterwards with grease, honey (and) lint every day until he recovers wound in the head” 

Around 100 years after his death Imhotep was deified (made into a god). He became the god of medicine and healing. Small temples were built in honor of him. People with injuries would sleep near his temple hoping to be healed. As a god, Imhotep was also worshiped by scribes. Scribes would offer a couple drops of water in libation to him before starting to write. Even when the Greeks took over, he was identified with another deified man called Asclepius and the Greeks continued to honor and build temples for him. 
This continued until the Arab invasion in North Africa in the 7th century AD. Imhotep did many things that boosted Egyptian society to amazing heights. He was the architect that changed Egyptian funeral architecture from mastabas to the phenomenal structures we today call pyramids. As a physician he healed many people and saved many lives, which after his death lead to him becoming a medicine god.

The NHL All-Star Game SuperSkills Competition, at first called the National Hockey League All-Star Skills Competition, is an event on the night before the NHL All-Star Game. First held at the 41st National Hockey League All-Star Game in Pittsburgh in 1990, the NHL hosts the competition to show off the skills of the all-star players. Events include shot accuracy, fastest skater, puck control relay, hardest shot, breakaway challenge, and an elimination shootout. Players are put into teams in the same way the All-Star Game is done, which is by conferences. After each event, the winning conference is given points.
This event is to show who is the fastest skater while also moving the puck through pylons. Two races happen; the first one has three skaters on each team race against each other, and the second has the best single racers from each team. One point is given out to the winner of each of these two events.
This event is to see who can skate the fastest around the rink once. Two races are held; one for the team, and one for the faster single person.

This event shows who has the hardest shot. Two points are given out; one for the team that has the highest average shot, and one for the player with the hardest shot. Zdeno Chara has the record for hardest shot; he set the record in 2009 when his shot went 105.4 mph. Al Iafrate had the old record, which was 105.2 mph

This event sees who can shoot four targets best. Each target is put in a corner of the net. Two points are given out; one point is for the team that hits the targets in the least amount of shots, and one point for the player who hits the targets in the least amount of shots. A player has hit all four targets in only four tries seven times: Ray Bourque in 1992 and 1993, Mark Messier in 1996, Jeremy Roenick in 2004, Tomas Kaberle in 2008, and Dany Heatley, and Evgeni Malkin in 2009.

This event has players shoot on a goalie. Two points are awarded; one for the team that scores the most goals, and one point to the goalie who lets in the least amount of goals. Starting in 2008, players were given points on who could score the most creative goals. Winners were voted on by fans voting with text messages.

This event has players try to score on a breakaway against a goalie. When a player doesn't score, he is not allowed to compete anymore. The winner is the player who is the last one still playing.

Smythe Division

The Smythe Division was one of the playing divisions of the National Hockey League (NHL). It was formed in 1974, and was part of the new Clarence Campbell Conference. A conference is a group of divisions. The division was named after Conn Smythe, owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs from 1927 to 1961. In 1993, the league divisions changed, and most of the Smythe Division became the Pacific Division. The Smythe Division won the Stanley Cup six times.
The first teams that played in the Smythe Division were:
The Canucks were the only team moved from the old East Division. The Blackhawks, Blues, and North Stars were moved from the old West Division. The Scouts were a new team. The Scouts now play as the New Jersey Devils. The North Stars now play as the Dallas Stars.
The new Patrick Division was also in the Clarence Campbell Conference. The other conference was the Prince of Wales Conference. The East Division and the new Adams Division were in the Prince of Wales Conference. This was the first year for conferences in the NHL. The old West Division teams were moved into all of the new divisions.
In 1976, the Scouts moved to Denver, Colorado and started playing as the Colorado Rockies.
In 1978, the North Stars move to the Adams Division.

In 1979, the World Hockey Association (WHA) went out of business. Four teams from the NWA join the NHL. The Edmonton Oilers and the Winnipeg Jets join the Smythe Division.

In 1981, the NHL changed the conference and division lineups. A number of teams moved to new divisions and conferences. The Blackhawks and the Blues left the Smythe Division for the Norris Division, which was now a part of the Clarence Campbell Conference.
The Calgary Flames left the Patrick Division, and the Los Angeles Kings left the Norris Division. Both teams joined the Smythe Division. The Smythe Division now had the following teams:

In 1982 the Rockies moved to the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey and started playing as the New Jersey Devils. They also joined the Patrick Division.
The Winnipeg Jets moved from the Norris Division to the Smythe Division.

The division lineup stayed the same until 1991, when a new team, the San Jose Sharks was formed in San Jose, California and joined the Smythe Division.
In 1993, the NHL again changed the conferenes and divisions. The Eastern Conference contained the Northeast Division and the Atlantic Division. The Western Conference contained Central Division and the Pacific Division. The Jets were moved to the Central Division. All the other teams in the Smythe Division were moved to the Pacific Division. They were joined by the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, a new team that played in Anaheim, California.
In 1984, the Oilers were the first team in the Smythe Division to win the Stanley Cup. They also won the Stanley Cup in 1985, 1987, and 1988. In 1989, the Flames won the Stanley Cup. In 1990, the Oilers won the last Stanley Cup for the Smythe division.

Diamondback Rattlesnake

The Diamondback Rattlesnake is a very poisonous rattlesnake. Diamondbacks are found from Florida to California. The bite from a big rattlesnake can hold enough poison to kill a person. However, if the victim gets to a doctor quickly enough, he or she can usually survive. If you spend time in regions where diamondback rattlesnakes live, you should take a few precautions. People must be especially careful around caves. Rattlesnakes sometimes hibernate in caves during cool weather. If you listen carefully for its unusual rattling noise, you can know where it is hiding.

Carambola, also known as star fruit,are tropical fruits. The fruit grows on trees that are native to India, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. Star fruit is common in the south of Asia, Australia and all of the islands around Australia. The tree is also grown in tropic islands. 

The carambola has been growing in parts of Asia for hundreds of years. It may have first been in Sri Lanka and Moluccas. Malaysia grows the most carambola in the world.
Because of insects and disease, whole carambolas cannot be taken into the USA. In the USA, star fruit is grown in Florida, Puerto Rico and Hawaii. 

Star fruit tastes best ripe (yellow with a little green). It will also be brown on the five edges and feel hard. If the star fruit is overripe it will be yellow with brown spots.
You can eat all of the fruit, even the skin. It is sweet and very juicy. The taste is a little bit like a mix of papaya, orange and grapefruit.

The Carambola is a tropical fruit. In India, it grows up to 4,000 feet in elevation. It prefers a total exposure to the sun but requires high humidity and a total of 70 inches or more of rainfall a year. It requires good drainage of the soil
Carambola trees are planted 20 feet or more from each other. They grow fast and makes fruit when they are four or five years old. The rain during Spring makes the amount of fruit lower. In perfect conditions, Carambola can make from 200 to 400 pounds of fruit a year. The fruit is picked mainly during the months of June, July, and August.
Major pests are fruit flies, ants, and birds. In the United States, they are also vulnerable to frosts.

Langston University is an university in Langston, Oklahoma, USA. It is the only historically black college in the state. It is the westernmost historically black college in the United States. Though in a rural setting just 10 miles east of Guthrie, Langston also serves an urban mission with University Centers in both Tulsa and Oklahoma City.

The school was started in 1897. Tbe school was first known as the Oklahoma Colored Agricultural and Normal University. Langston University was created because of the second Morrill Act in 1890. The law made states with land grant colleges (such as Oklahoma State University, then Oklahoma A&M) to either allow African-Americans in as students, or provide an alternative school for them to attend. This was required in order to receive federal money. Langston University is named for John Mercer Langston (1829-1897). He was a civil rights pioneer. He was the first African American member of Congress from Virginia. Langston started the Howard University Law School. He also served as American consul-general to Haiti. 

Poet Melvin B. Tolson taught at Langston from 1947 until 1964. Tolson was portrayed by Denzel Washington in the film "The Great Debaters".

The University offers associate's, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in a variety of disciplines. It is known as a leader in the field of agricultural research. It hosts the internationally known E (Kika) de la Garza Institute for Goat Research. The School currently has an open doors admissions policy. 

The university was accredited with a Doctorate of Physical Therapy program in 2005.

The student life at Langston University got the attention of BET and the second season of the reality television show College Hill was filmed there. The Langston University Quiz Bowl team won games against Spelman and an all-star team from the City Colleges of Chicago on the 2009 nationally televised "Black College Quiz" show airing nationally throughout Black History Month in 2009 to make the championship game.

Marques Haynes

Marques Haynes (born October 3, 1926) is an American former professional basketball player and member of the Harlem Globetrotters. He is known for his ability to dribble the ball and keep it away from defenders. According to the movie "Harlem Globetrotters: Six Decades of Magic", Haynes could dribble the ball as many as six times a second.

Haynes learned to dribble the basketball from his sisters. His skills may have been helped by handling the ball on the dirt courts of his hometown. A native of Sand Springs, Oklahoma, he played basketball for Langston University from 1942-1946. While at Langston, he once dribbled out the clock in a conference tournament game to taunt an opponent, Southern University. Southern had just run up the score against a weaker team (Sam Huston College, later Huston-Tillotson University). The Sam Huston team was coached by a young Jackie Robinson. Haynes' own coach, the famous Zip Gayles, punished him for the taunting, but it helped draw the attention of the Globetrotters. They were always on the search for trick ballhandlers. Langston was invited to play an exhibition game against the Globetrotters in Oklahoma City. In that game, Haynes led Langston to a 4-point win. He was immediately invited to join the Globetrotters. He returned to Langston to complete his degree. Then he began his long professional career.

Haynes played with the Globetrotters from 1947-1953. Upon leaving in 1953, he turned down a $35,000 a year offer from the Philadelphia Warriors that would have made him the second-highest paid player in the NBA. Instead, he started his own barnstorming team, the Harlem Magicians. Boxing legend Sugar Ray Robinson sometimes played games with this team. Haynes later rejoined the Globetrotters as a player/coach. He also played for the Harlem Wizards. 

He retired in 1992 after a 46-year professional career, and was inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame on October 2, 1998. He now resides in Dallas, Texas. 

Many consider him the top ballhandler who ever lived. His game influenced players such as Bob Cousy, Pete Maravich, and Fred "Curly" Neal. It is possible that Haynes has played more professional basketball games than anyone in history, staying active well into his sixties.

Southwestern Athletic Conference

The Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) is a college athletic conference based in Birmingham, Alabama. It is made up of historically black universities in the Southern United States. It participates in the NCAA's Division I for all sports. In football, it participates in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). 

The SWAC is one of two conferences (the other being the Ivy League) which do not take part in postseason play in the FCS football tournament. It is the only one of the two whose members offer a full range of scholarships for football. The SWAC instead splits its schools into two divisions, and plays a conference championship game. Furthermore, one SWAC game, the Bayou Classic between Southern and Grambling State, is positioned on the schedule after the NCAA tournament has begun. In addition, Alabama State plays Division II rival Tuskegee annually on Thanksgiving Day (The Turkey Day Classic). 

In 1920, athletic officials from six Texas HBCUs — C.H. Fuller of Bishop College, Red Randolph and C.H. Patterson of Paul Quinn College, E.G. Evans, H.J. Evans and H.J. Starns of Prairie View A&M, D.C. Fuller of Texas College and G. Whitte Jordan of Wiley College — met in Houston, Texas, to discuss common interests. At this meeting, they agreed to form a new league, the SWAC.

Paul Quinn became the first of the original members to leave the league when it did so in 1929. When Langston University of Oklahoma was allowed into the conference two years later, it began the migration of state-supported institutions into the SWAC. Southern University entered the league in 1934. Arkansas AM&N entered in 1936 and Texas Southern University in 1954. 

As the state-supported schools became bigger, it became difficult for the church-supported schools to pay for their sports teams. Soon the church-supported schools started to leave the conference. Bishop withdrew from the conference in 1956, Langston in 1957 and Huston-Tillotson (formerly Samuel Huston) in 1959. That happened one year after two more state-supported schools entered the league (Grambling College and Jackson State College). The enter-exit cycle continued in 1961 when Texas College withdrew, followed by the entrance of Alcorn A&M in 1962. Wiley left in 1968, the same year Mississippi Valley State College entered. Arkansas AM&N exited in 1970 and Alabama State University entered in 1982. Arkansas-Pine Bluff (formerly Arkansas AM&N) rejoined the SWAC on July 1, 1997, regaining full-member status one year later. Alabama A&M University became the conference’s tenth member when it became a full member in September, 1999 after a one year period as an affiliate SWAC member.

Current championship competition offered by the SWAC includes competition for men in baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, indoor track, outdoor track & field and tennis. Women’s competition is offered in the sports of basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, indoor track, outdoor track & field, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball.

There are currently 10 members in the SWAC.


All games at were played at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.

Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award

The Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) is a Major League Baseball (MLB) award given each year to one outstanding player in the American and National Leagues. Since 1931, it has been awarded by the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA). The winner receives the Kenesaw Mountain Landis Memorial Baseball Award. The award is named in honor of the first MLB commissioner. Landis served from 1920 to 1944. MVP voting takes place before the postseason. The results are not announced until after the World Series. The BBWAA began asking three writers in each league city in 1938. They made that number two per league city in 1961.

First basemen, with 33 winners, have won the most MVPs among infielders. This is followed by second basemen (16), third basemen (15), and shortstops (14). Of the twenty-three pitchers who have won the award, fourteen are right-handed while nine are left-handed. Carl Hubbell and Hal Newhouser are the only pitchers to win more than once. Newhouser won his in 1944 and 1945. Stan Musial, Alex Rodriguez, and Robin Yount have won at different positions. Rodriguez is the only player to win the award with two different teams at two different positions. Barry Bonds has won the most often (seven times). He has also won it the most times in a row (2001–2004). Jimmie Foxx was the first player to win more than once. Ten players have won three times and seventeen have won twice.

The award's only tie occurred in the National League in 1979 when Keith Hernandez and Willie Stargell received the same amount of points. There have been 17 unanimous winners, meaning they received all the first-place votes. The New York Yankees have the most winning players with 22. The St. Louis Cardinals have the second most with 20 winners. Five teams have not had a winner. The most recent winners are Joe Mauer in the American League and Albert Pujols in the National League.

Before the 1910 season, Hugh Chalmers of Chalmers Automobile announced he would present a Chalmers Model 30 automobile to the player with the highest batting average in Major League Baseball at the end of the season. The 1910 race for best average in the American League was between the Detroit Tigers' widely disliked Ty Cobb and Nap Lajoie of the Cleveland Indians. On the last day of the season, Lajoie overtook Cobb's batting average with seven bunt hits against the St. Louis Browns. American League President Ban Johnson said a recalculation showed that Cobb had won the race anyway. Chalmers ended up giving cars to both players.

The following season, Chalmers created the Chalmers Award. A committee of baseball writers were to come together after the season to determine the "most important and useful player to the club and to the league". Since the award was not as useful at advertising as Chalmers had hoped, it was discontinued after 1914.

In 1922 the American League created a new award to honor "the baseball player who is of the greatest all-around service to his club". Winners, voted on by a committee of eight baseball writers chaired by James Crusinberry, received a bronze medal and a cash prize. Voters were required to select one player from each team. Player-managers and prior award winners were could not win. These problems resulted in the award's being dropped after 1928. The National League award, without these restrictions, lasted from 1924 to 1929.

The BBWAA first awarded the modern MVP after the 1931 season, took the format the National League used to distribute its league award. One writer in each city with a team filled out a ten-place ballot. Ten points were given for the recipient of a first-place vote, nine for a second-place vote, and so on. In 1938, the BBWAA raised the amount of voters to three per city and gave 14 points for a first-place vote. The only significant change since then happened in 1961, when the number of voters was lowered to two per league city.

Silver medal

A silver medal is a medal given to the second place finisher of contests (usually sports competitions) such as the Olympic Games or Commonwealth Games. First and third place finishers usually receive a gold medal and bronze medal, respectively.

In 1896, winners' medals were made from silver. The custom of gold-silver-bronze for the first three places dates from the 1904 games. It has been copied for many other sports events. Creating the medals is the responsibility of the host city. From 1928-1968 the design was always the same. One side showed a design by Florentine artist Giuseppe Cassioli with text giving the host city. The other side showed another design of an Olympic champion. From 1972-2000, Cassioli's design (or a slight reworking) remained on the one with a custom design by the host city on the other. Because Cassioli's design showed a Roman amphitheatre for what was originally a Greek games, a new design was create for the Athens 2004 Games. Winter Olympics medals have been of more varied design.

In The Open Championship golf tournament, the Silver Medal is an award given to the lowest scoring amateur player at the tournament.

Cáhuil

Cáhuil is a little Chilean village located 15 kilometers at the south of Pichilemu, in the outfall of the Nilahue lake, in the Region of O'Higgins. "Cáhuil" means in Mapudungun language "seagulls place". The main characteristic of the place is the crafty production of "coastal salt", oysters and choros. The Cáhuil Lagoon is a place suitable for fishing, swimming and boat travels.

The salines in this area are very old. It is known that the indigenous people extracted it in a very rudimentary way. However, the extracting method has been improved and the production has increased. As of 1978, more than a 60% of the population of Cáhuil lived around the salt production, production not related to industrial enterprises.

In a way to promote the tourism in Cáhuil, the Municipality of Pichilemu created the "Salt Route", that takes the tourists into places where the salt generation process is dpne. This travel starts in Pichilemu and includes Cáhuil, Barrancas, La Villa, El Bronce, La Palmilla and La Plaza. In this route can be found two rural ranchs, "Oro Blanco" and "El Bronce".

In the Cáhuil zone can be found at least 46 birds species, many of them in in extinction danger. Some of them are the coscoroba swan, larus maculipennis, garza cuca, among others. It hosts at least seven silvester ducks species.

Derivative (mathematics)

In mathematics, the derivative is a way to represent rate of change, that is - the amount by which a function is changing at one given point. For functions that act on the real numbers, is the slope of the tangent line at a point on a graph. The derivative is often written using "dy over dx" (meaning the difference in y divided by the difference in x):

The derivative is defined as the change in y over the change in x, as the distance between formula_2 and formula_3 becomes infinitely small (infinitesimal). In mathematical terms,
That is, as the distance between the two x points (h) becomes closer to zero, the slope of the line between them comes closer to resembling a tangent line.

Derivatives of linear functions (functions of the form "a" "x" + "b" with no quadratic or higher terms) are constant. That is, the derivative in one spot on the graph will remain the same on another.

When the dependent variable y directly takes x's value, the slope of the line is 1 in all places, so formula_5 regardless of where the position is.

When y modifies x's number by a constant value, the slope is still one because the change in x and y do not change if the graph is shifted up. That is, the slope is still 1 throughout the entire graph, so its derivative is also 1.

Power functions (e.g. formula_6) behave differently than linear functions because their slope varies (because they have an exponent).

Power functions, in general, follow the rule that formula_7. That is, if we give a the number 6, then formula_8

Another possibly not so obvious example is the function formula_9. This is essentially the same because 1/x can be simplified to use exponents:

In addition, roots can be changed to use fractional exponents where their derivative can be found:

Exponential functions (formula_15) are a special exception in that their derivative is formula_15, not formula_17.

The derivative of logarithms is the reciprocal:
Take, for example, formula_19. This can be reduced to (by the properties of logarithms):
The logarithm of 5 is a constant, so its derivative is 0. The derivative of log(x) is formula_21. So,

The cosine function is the derivative of the sine function, while the derivative of cosine is negative sine:

Derivatives can be broken up into smaller parts where they are manageable (as they have only one of the above function characteristics), for example:

<doc id="242761" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242761" title="Ruminant">
Ruminant

A ruminant is a mammal that eats and digests plant-based food such as grass. Ruminating mammals include cattle, goats, sheep, giraffes, bison, yaks, water buffalo, deer, camels, alpacas, llamas, wildebeest, antelope, pronghorn, and nilgai. The word "ruminant" comes from the Latin word "ruminaire" which means "to chew over again".

Rumination works by chewing and swallowing in the normal way to begin with, and then regurgitating the semi-digested cud to re-chew it and so get the most food value out of it.

Rumination makes the half-digested food particles smaller, before they can go through the process of digestion.

The primary difference between a ruminant and non-ruminants (such as people, dogs, and pigs) is that ruminants have a four-compartment stomach. 

The four parts of the stomach are the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. In the first two chambers, the rumen and the reticulum, the food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material. Solids clump together to form the cud or bolus. 

The cud is then regurgitated (brought up to the mouth) and chewed slowly. Fiber, especially cellulose, is broken down by microbes (bacteria, archaea, protozoa, and fungi).

Even though the rumen and reticulum have different names, they are the same functional space, as the digesta (food material) can move back and forth between them. 

The digesta then passes into the next chamber, the omasum, where water and many of the mineral elements are absorbed into the blood stream. 

After this the digesta is moved to the true stomach, the abomasum. Digestion takes place here. 

The digesta is finally moved into the small intestine, where nutrients are absorbed. Water is absorbed in the large intestine, leaving the waste.

Almost all the glucose produced by breaking down the cellulose is used by microbes in the rumen, and so ruminants usually absorb little glucose from the small intestine. Rather, ruminants' requirement for glucose (for brain function and lactation if appropriate) is made by the liver.

There are 3.5 billion domestic ruminants, with about 95% being cattle, goats and sheep.

There are also about 75 million wild ruminants. They can be found anywhere except for the continents Australia and Antarctica. Most of them are in Europe, Africa and Asia.

Bible version debate

The Bible is a collection of texts. The original of these texts were written in different languages. Today, the collection of texts that is called "The Bible" is written in one language only. For this reason, at least some texts need to be translated. Versions of the Bible are also different in the texts they include, some texts are not part of some Bible versions. One of the first such translations is the Septuagint, which is Ancient Greek. Another well-known translation is the Vulgate, which is Latin. From about the 14th century, the Bible was also translated into other languages.

Translating a text is also always linked to looking at its meaning, and to interpreting it. A word in one language cannot be translated into a word in a different language, with exactly the same meaning. 
One such method of translation is called "literal translation" or "formal equivalence". Literal translation tries to be as close as possible to what is written in the original language. Often this means translating each word separately. There are a number of problems with literal translations: First, words must be added, to get a valid grammar in the target language. These words are not in the source text. The second problem is that the reader must be familiar with the subject, to understand some of the translation.

Another way is to look at the thoughts and ideas of the source text and to get these into the target language. This is called "dynamic equivalence". A translation that uses dynamic equivalence may use other words and phrases, but tries to keep the meaning intact.

A third way is called "paraphrasing". It tries to explain the concepts that are found in the text, and does not even use dynamic equivalence. That way, paraphrasing may leave out sections of text, or add other sections that explain these concepts. A paraphrased text may be very easy to understand, but is not suited for in-depth study.

Another problem that can occur with translation is that the meaning of some words may not be known. This is often the case with words that only occur once in a text. Such words are known as Hapax legomena. Their meaning must be guessed from the context.

Before the invention of the printing press, texts had to be copied by hand. This introduced errors. After a certain time there were different versions of the same text. Comparing such versions is known as textual criticism. The translation of two different versions of the same text may result in two different texts.

Some translators also translate the names, others simply write the name as it occurs in the original.

1955 World Series

The 1955 World Series was played between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Yankees. The Dodgers won the Series in seven games. This was their first championship in team history. It would be the only Series the Dodgers won in Brooklyn. The team moved to Los Angeles after the 1957 season. The last time the Brooklyn team won a World Championship was in 1900. The team was called the Brooklyn Superbas. The series was called the Chronicle-Telegraph Cup. Their opponent then was fellow National League competitor Pittsburgh Pirates. 

This series would also end a long period of success for the Yankees in the World Series. It was the Yankees' first loss in a World Series since 1942. It was only their second loss since 1926. The Yankees were 15-2 in the series during that time. They would lose again in 1957, 1960, 1963, and 1964. The Yankees would have a record of 4-5 in World Series over the next decade. 

The two teams were meeting in a World Series for the fifth time in nine years. The Yankees had won in 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1953.

Second baseman

Second base, or "2B", is the second of four places on a baseball field which must be touched in order by a base runner before he can score a run for that player's team. A second baseman is the baseball player who guards second base. Also called "second bagger", the second baseman often has quick hands and feet. He needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly. He must be able to make the turn on a double play. Also, shortstops and second basemen are usually right-handed. This makes it easier to turn a double play. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4.

Current second basemen include Chase Utley, Robinson Cano, Dustin Pedroia, Orlando Hudson, Aaron Hill and Ben Zobrist.

The following second basemen have been elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum:

Geoffrey Burbidge

Geoffrey Burbidge (born Chipping Norton, 24 September 1925; died La Jolla, California, 26 January 2010) was an English astrophysicist. For many years he was professor at the University of California, San Diego. In 1957 he published a famous paper, together with three other physicists, about the origin of elements. Many scientists disagreed with ideas that he had later in his life, because he did not believe in the Big Bang theory.

He started to study history at the University of Bristol, but soon changed to physics because he could then get financial help from the government (World War II was on, so science was very important to the government). He went to London and got a doctorate from University College London in 1951. He met the astronomer Margaret Peachey. He became very interested in astronomy and he married her in 1948. From then on they always worked together in several places. They worked at Harvard, the University of Chicago and Cambridge University. Then Margaret got work at the California Institute of Technology, while Geoffrey worked at the Mount Wilson Observatory and Palomar Observatory. They both got jobs at the University of California, San Diego, in 1962.

In 1957 he and his wife, together with William Fowler, the American physicist, and Fred Hoyle, the British astronomer, wrote a 104-page paper about stellar nucleosynthesis. The paper became known as the B2FH (because of their initials). It talked about nuclear reactions inside stars, showing how these reactions tear apart blocks of matter and put it together again differently. It was a similar idea to what Charles Darwin had written about 100 years earlier in the “Origin of Species”, where he had described how creatures had evolved. Scientists saw this paper as the most important paper ever written about astrophysics. 

Later in his career Burbidge refused to accept the Big Bang theory which describes the start of the universe. Quasars are very bright objects with a very high redshift. The Big Bank theorists say that they come from places extremely far away in the universe. But Burbidge thought that quasars come from nearby galaxies, travelling near the speed of light, which explains their redshift. He thought they produced new matter as old matter was destroyed by reactions.

Although many scientists disagree with Burbidge’s later ideas, he is still thought of as an extremely important scientist. He was given many honours. In 2005 he and his wife were awarded the British Royal Astronomical Society Gold Medal.

Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is the use of radiation to treat diseases. It is typically used in the treatment of cancer.

Radiation therapy may help cure several different types of cancer if they are limited to one area of the body. Doctors also use it to prevent tumor recurrance after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy works together with chemotheraphy. Radiation therapy has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in cancers known to be affected by radiation.

Radiation therapy is used on tumors because of its ability to control cell growth. Ionizing radiation works by damaging the DNA of exposed tissue leading to cellular death. To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through in order to treat the tumor), doctors aim weaker radiation beams from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger absorbed dose there than in the surrounding, healthy tissue. Besides the tumor itself, the target for the radiation may also include the lymph nodes that drain the area. Doctors include the lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with tumor, or if there is thought to be a risk of that individual cancer cells will spread. It is impossible to aim the radiation beam exactly because the tumor moves as the patient breathes. So, doctors also expect to include some heathly tissue around the tumor to make sure that the entire turmor is hit by radiation.

Radiation oncology is the medical specialty concerned with prescribing radiation. This is different than radiology, the use of radiation in medical imaging and diagnosis). Radiation may be prescribed by a radiation oncologist with intent to cure ("curative") or for adjuvant therapy. It may also be used as palliative treatment (where cure is not possible and the aim is for local disease control or symptomatic relief) or as therapeutic treatment (where the therapy has survival benefit and it can be curative). It is also common to combine radiation therapy with surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, Immunotherapy or some mixture of the four. Most common cancer types can be treated with radiation therapy in some way. The precise treatment intent (curative, adjuvant, neoadjuvant, therapeutic, or palliative) will depend on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. Total body irradiation (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a bone marrow transplant. Brachytherapy, in which a radiation source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs.

Radiation therapy can also be used in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, severe thyroid eye disease, pterygium, pigmented villonodular synovitis, and prevention of keloid scar growth, vascular restenosis, and heterotopic ossification. Doctors limit the use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions because they worry about the radiation could start new cancers.

Dacarbazine

Dacarbizine is a type of drug used to fight cancer. It works by changing DNA, which makes cancer cells grow more slowly or completely stop growing. It is used against metastatic melanoma. It doesn't often help, though; only about 15.3% of people who use the drug respond to it. People don't live any longer if they use this drug, too.

It has side effects, including less blood cells, damage to the liver, and it sometimes makes other types of cancer start growing.

The Ross Park is an old hotel in the Chilean city of Pichilemu. It was created by Agustín Ross Edwards in 1885, and remodeled in December 1987.

The park is located on Agustín Ross Avenue, in front of the old Ross Casino. The hotel was originally named "Great Hotel Pichilemu" (). The once grand Ross Hotel was constructed at the same time. Although the hotel, one of the oldest in Chile, is still partially open to guests, it is in a high state of disrepair.

The hotel was named National Monuments on February 25, 1988.

Liceo Santa Cruz

Santa Cruz High School or Liceo Santa Cruz is a Chilean public high school located in Santa Cruz.

In August 2 1963, by decree 11.608, was created the Men's High School of Santa Cruz, after a proposal by the Rotary Club of the city and the Governor of the Department of Santa Cruz, Carlos Cardoen. This latter enthused Adriano Díaz, who donated a terrain where the High School was going to be constructed. However, a Sport Complex was constructed there instead.

The High School started working since March 1, 1964 in an old house in the street Nicolás Palacios, with at least 170 students, distributed between 4 classes. Many of these students already had approved their first or second grade in "Humanities" in the Pedro Aguirre Cerda High School, but it was not recognized officially and worked with a group of teachers freely.

The first Principal was Osvaldo Castillo, who contracted "normalist" teachers, and almost all of them had worked in the Pedro Aguirre High School. 

The students of the High School appeared for the first time openly in May 21, 1964. Shortly after that, it was designed the logo and a standard; both included palm trees, characteristical in the city. The anthem of the High School was composed by Raúl Benavides.

<doc id="242910" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242910" title="Food waste">
Food waste

The European Union Commission defines food waste foods that are thrown away, either because they are not needed, or because they must be thrown away by law. There are many definitions of waste, and so there are also different definitions of food waste. The United States Environmental Protection Agency defines food waste for the United States as "Uneaten food and food preparation wastes from residences and [shops] such as grocery stores, restaurants, and produce stands, institutional cafeterias and kitchens, and industrial sources like employee lunchrooms".

The definitions of food waste can vary in the following ways:
The definitions are made more complex, because certain kinds of waste are defined in reference to other kinds of waste. Certain groups have not considered food waste to be waste, because it still has applications.

Large amounts of food waste can occur at any stage in the process of producing food. In subsistence agriculture, the amounts of food waste are unknown. Very likely, very little food is wasted, because food is produced because of a need for food. In the developed world, the food industry produces food for a global marketplace demand. 
Research has been done to see where food waste occurred. The researchers looked at the food industry of the United States and found that food was wasted at the beginning of the food production. From planting, crops can be subjected to pest infestations and bad weather, which cause losses before harvest. Natural forces such as temperature and rainfall are the main influences on the growth of crops. For this reason, all forms of outdoor agriculture is subject to losses beecause of these influences. The use of machinery in harvesting can cause waste, as harvesters may be unable to discern between ripe and immature crops, or collect only part of a crop. Food is also wasted because it does not meet certain standards or regulations for quality and appearance As a result, certain crops that do not meet these standards are not harvested; left in the field, they can provide fertilizer, or food for animals.

It is unknown how much food waste occurs during food processing. When food is stored, considerable amounts are wasted because of pests and microorganisms. This problem occurs in countries where it is both relatively hot, and humid. These conditions boost the growth of pests and microrganisms. Extreme temperature, humidity, or microoganisms also influence the nutritional value, caloric value and edibility of crops and account for food waste. The "qualitative losses" are more difficult to assess than quantitative ones. More losses occur because the food is not handled correctly, or because it loses weight or volume.

It is difficult to reduce some of the food waste produced by processing without affecting the qualty of the product. Certain regulations concerning the safety of foods cause food to be wasted, before it even reaches the market.
Safety regulations are in place to protect the health of the consumer. They are very important, especially where foodstuffs of animal origin are processed. Contaminated products from these sources can lead to and are associated with microbiological and chemical hazards.

Preventing health issues is more important than preventing food waste, or the reuse of foods that do not meet the standards.,

Parliament Hill

Parliament Hill is set of buildings in Ottawa that is where the Government of Canada meets and members of parliament make laws. It is called Parliament Hill because it is on a hill above the Ottawa River.

There are three main buildings: the west block, the east block and the centre block.

A fire in 1916 burned the Centre Block and only the library was saved. The building was rebuilt and the Peace Tower was finished in 1927.

The roof of each building is made of copper which turns green over time.

There are many statues around Parliament Hill including many former Prime Ministers and 5 famous women who helped women gain equal rights in Canada. There is also a centennial flame that was lit when Canada turned 100 years old.

Pine Gap

Pine Gap is a remote facility 19km south west of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is officially recognised as a joint defense of Australia and the US satellite tracking station. 
Conspiracies exist which link the site to covert programs for monitoring and testing of laser weaponry for satellite and space based attack/defense.

Pine Gap employs approximately 700 American and Australians and is responsible for about 2,000 people in the Alice Springs region who are US citizens. 
The US influence in the area is evident by American sports such as baseball and American football. Similarly, the celebration of American festivals which are normally not active in Australia, such as Halloween, Independence Day and Thanksgiving also showcase the US cultural influence. A number of Australians join in the festivities from time to time.

Ben &amp; Jerry's

Ben and Jerry’s is an American ice cream company. The company sells all sorts of different ice-creams.

In 1977, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield completed a course on ice cream making at Pennsylvania State University. On May 5, 1978, they opened a first ice cream shop in a gas station in Burlington, Vermont. In 1979, on the first anniversary they had the first free cone day. This is now a celebration all over the world.
In 1980, Ben and Jerry got space in a building in South Champlain Street in Burlington and started packing their ice cream in pint containers. In 1981, the first Ben & Jerry’s official shop opened on Route 7 in Shelburne, Vermont. In 1983, Ben & Jerry’s ice cream was used to build “the world’s largest ice cream sundae” in St. Albans, Vermont. The sundae weighed 27,102 pounds. In 1986, Ben & Jerry’s made its “Cowmobile”. This was a Ben and Jerry’s van to pass out free ice cream. The Cowmobile was driven by Ben and Jerry themselves. Four months later the “Cowmobile” burned down outside Cleveland. Ben said it looked like “the world’s biggest baked Alaska.” In 1988, Ben and Jerry’s won the title of U.S Small Business Persons Of The Year awarded by U.S. President Ronald Reagan. 

Ben & Jerry’s has their shop all over the world, like Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland , Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom,and the United States.

Placozoa

The Placozoa are an animal phylum, a primitive form of invertebrate. They are the simplest in structure of all (metazoa). 

The Placozoa has only one species, Trichoplax adhaerens. There is enough genetic diversity that it is possible that there are multiple, morphologically similar species. 

Although they were first discovered in 1883, a common name does not exist for the taxon. The scientific name literally means "flat animals".

"Trichoplax" is a small, flattened, animal around a millimetre across. Like an Amoeba, it has no regular outline, although the upper surface is always flattened. The body consists of an outer layer of simple epithelium enclosing a loose sheet of cells. The epithelial cells bear flagella, which the animal uses to help it creep along the seafloor. Between these layers is the fiber syncytium, a liquid-filled cavity strutted open by star-like fibers.

"Trichoplax" feed by absorbing food particles—mainly microbes—with their underside. They generally reproduce asexually, by dividing or budding, but can also reproduce sexually. Though "Trichoplax" has a small genome in comparison to other animals, nearly 87% of its 11,514 protein-coding genes are similar to known genes in other animals.

In the 1960s and 1970s renewed interest among researchers led to the discovery that the animals people had been studying are adults, not larvae. This newfound interest also included study of the organism in nature (as opposed to aquariums).

Sipuncula

The Sipuncula (or Sipunculida, or peanut worms) are a small phylum of marine worms. The phylum has 144–320 species (estimates vary) of these bilaterally symmetrical, unsegmented worms.

Sipunculans are worm-like animals ranging from in length, with most species being under . The body consists of a narrow front section, called the "introvert" and a larger trunk section. The introvert is retractable into the trunk. 

Sipunculans have a coelom (body cavity), and a body wall somewhat similar to that of annelids. The body wall is strong and muscular. When threatened, Sipunculids can retract their body into a shape resembling a peanut kernel – a practice that has given rise to the name "peanut worm".

The most recognizable part of Sipunculan worms is their mouth, which is surrounded by a mass of 18–24 ciliated tentacles, all of which may be inverted into the body. The tentacles are used to gather organic detritus from the water or substrate, and are probably also function as gills. The mouth and tentacles lie at the tip of the introvert, which is otherwise decorated with numerous spines or nodules. In contrast, the trunk tends to be relatively smooth.

Table (information)

A table of information is a set of facts arranged in rows and columns. It is a way of displaying information. It requires a medium, such as writing or print on paper, or a computer monitor. It is both a mode of visual communication and also a way to set out data. 

A table consists of an orderly arrangement of rows and columns. The columns and rows usually have names or labels. Tables may include notes, headers, footers or other features. Like other graphic forms such as diagrams and illustrations, tables are often used together with prose. In books and articles, tables are often given numbers and captions. 

Tables were the first way to print social and scientific data, before any other kind of graphics like graphs and charts. All the information about a modern society was recorded and published first as tables. Marriage certificates were written tables. Census results were recorded as tables, and later analysed in printed tables. All weather observations were published as printed numerical tables. Many kinds of reports to Parliament contained tables of data. Many of these methods were invented in Britain, because the government collected statistics about the population, and then published the results.

The use of tables is widespread in all types of communication, research and data analysis. Tables appear in print media, handwritten notes, computer software, architectural ornamentation, traffic signs and many other places. The details vary according to circumstances. Tables are extremely flexible, and can easily be constructed on computer and in print.
Tables are not always easy to understand, and there is a whole industry which takes table information and turns it into other forms, such as graphs and charts, for the benefit of the reader.

Siphon (mollusc)

A siphon is a long tube-like structure that is present in certain aquatic molluscs: Gastropods, bivalves, and cephalopods. The tube is used for the exchange of liquids, or air. This flow can have different purposes, the most common are breathing, locomotion, feeding and reproduction.

The siphon is part of the mantle of the mollusc, and the water flow is directed to (or from) the mantle cavity. 

A single siphon occurs in some gastropods. In those bivalves which have siphons, they are paired. In cephalopods, there is a single siphon or funnel which is known as a hyponome.

After the 1996 Manchester bombing, the Games were part of the development of Manchester. It helped Manchester's reputation as a European Global City, and also, internationally. Rapid economic growth and continued urban rebuilding of the city continued after the Games. This helped make it one of the main cities in the United Kingdom.

Events were held across Greater Manchester. The opening and closing ceremonies, the athletic and the rugby sevens events were held at the City of Manchester Stadium. It was built for the Games. The shooting events were held in the National Shooting Centre in Bisley, Surrey. This was some from the main focus of the Games in Manchester. This is unusual for a large multi-sport event.

Seventy-two nations competed in 14 individual sports and 3 team sports events.

Desso GrassMaster

Desso GrassMaster is a sports playing field surface made of natural grass that has artificial fibres added to it. The unique part of this system is the artificial grass fibres, stuck 20 cm deep, which cover 3% of the surface. During the growing process, the roots of the natural grass mix with the man-made grass fibres. They anchor the turf into a stable and even field. The roots of the natural grass mix with the fibres and anchor the field to create a solid structure with better drainage and better playing comfort.

Reinforced natural grass is used for stadium pitches and training pitches used for soccer, rugby, American football and baseball. Reinforced natural grass can also be used for events and concerts. The artificial turf injection shortens the recovery time for the grass.

In 2010, for the first time in history, a FIFA World Cup is played on grass pitches that are partly made up of artificial grass in the Mbombela Stadium and the Peter Mokaba Stadium.

Table (furniture)

A table is a piece of furniture with a flat top supported by one or more legs. We put things on a table, often for a short time, for example food and knives and forks, etc. at a meal, cups for drinks, a book, a map, writing paper when writing, and things for hobbies. 

We also put things on tables for a longer time, for example a TV, computer or decorations (pretty things). Often we put a cloth on the table, flat on the top. There are traditional ways of putting the cloth, knives and forks and food on the table for meals.

We can make some tables bigger, for example by pulling the top out. We can also fold some tables to transport them better, for example for camping. There are also small tables in trains and planes which we can fold or open. Some round tables come with a Lazy Susan. This is a rotating piece of wood in the center of the table.

Traditionally, tables in Japan, "chabudai", are low, sometimes round tables, for tea and food.

The name of the international organization Mensa is from the Latin word for table.

The Green Anaconda is the biggest snake in the world with unverified measurements of 34 feet although the longest confirmed specimens measure 25 feet long and weigh 550 pounds.Numerous claims of huge anacondas 50-60 feet long also exist but these have never been confirmed. The green anaconda is olive green with black spots. The green anaconda is a good swimmer and on land it moves slowly. The green anaconda spends hours of the day resting on branches or in wet ponds. When the night comes the green anaconda begins to hunt its prey, but it never hunts in flock. The green anaconda is really dangerous because of its poison.

The Green Anaconda lives in the Amazon Rainforest, South America. It usually likes to be near smaps and places like that. 

The Green Anaconda eats animals including fish, birds, ducks and turtles and sometimes the green Anaconda can even eat other snakes.

Manatee Palms Youth Services

Manatee Palms Youth Services is a hospital. It has 60 patients at its location in Bradenton, Florida. Manatee Palms Youth Services has been shut down by the State of Florida twice because of hurtful behavior from staff workers and nurses at its hospital. Florida will not let Manatee Palms admit any more patients because of this hurtful behavior. The State of Florida has found Manatee Palms a hospital that doesn't take care of its patients.

The first time abuse at Manatee Palms that is on public record happened in November 1991 when a staff worker sexually hurt a teenage patient. Another situation occurred in February 1994 when Mark Duane Brewer, a hospital counselor, had sex with a 16-year-old patient in the hospital. Another family filed suit against the same man in May of 1994, alleging their children were also raped. Another situation happened in 1996, when a staff member attacked a patient by putting him in a choke hold and throwing him to the ground. In 1997, an 18 year old man raped a patient at Manatee Palms. 

In October 2004, a sexual assault happened at the facility and the staff member admitted to it.

In November 2004, four patients ran away from the hospital, stole a car, caused crashes, and almost hit a sheriff's deputy. In February 2009, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of a former patient who was physically assaulted by staff on a daily basis. 

Manatee Palms was in the news after people found out that a sex offender was employed in 2003. The 41-year-old asked a 15-year-old girl to engage in sexual acts with him and record it with a video camera.

In April 2007, Manatee Palms was closed by the State of Florida for hiring staff members with criminal records, staff abusing patients, buildings falling apart, and threatening some people in Florida. Manatee Palms was fined $12,000 by the state and was forced to make lots of renovations. They reopened in May 2007. In April 2010, Manatee Palms was closed once again due to staff members hurting patients by breaking their bones.

Japanese cuisine

Japanese cuisine is not the same in every region of Japan. It is has two main groups. "Washoku" is traditional Japanese food and "Youshoku" is western style food which has been changed by local people. Japanese food has become more popular outside of Japan. 

Soya beans are a very important ingredient in Japanese cooking; it is used in soya sauce, miso and tofu. Soya milk is also used as a drink. One example of a dish with soya beans in it is tofu. Tofu is made from pressing soybeans into cubes and then boiling them. Tofu is often in soups and stews. Deep fried tofu is also used in many popular Japanese dishes, for example as kitsune udon and inari sushi.
Soya beans also have omega 3 fatty acids, that can also be found in salmon. In Japan, Udon is traditionally eaten on New Year's Eve, because it is believed that if you eat it you will live a long, healthy life. 

Noodles (like in most Asian foods) are used often in Japanese foods. The dishes usually come originally from Korea or China.

Japan is surrounded by the ocean so there is a rich variety of seafood which is an important part of Japanese cooking.
Japanese people did not eat meat until the Europeans first came. Fish was the most common food. 

Wasabi is Japanese horseradish. It is often a green paste used with sashimi and sushi. Wasabi is also used with many other Japanese foods. 
Wasabi is sold as a paste or in powder form. Wasabi powder has to be mixed with water to be turned into a paste. Wasabi has a strong, very spicy (hot) taste.
Sashimi is very thinly cut raw seafood. Many different kinds of fresh fish and other seafood are served raw in Japanese dishes. Sashimi is one of them. It is almost the same as sushi, but it has no vinegar rice. When the slices of fish are put on small pieces of rice they are called "Nigiri Sushi".
Sashimi is artistically arranged and put on the plate on top of shredded daikon and shiso leaves. The fish pieces are dipped into soya sauce before being eaten.
Seaweed has been a very important part of Japanese dishes for a long time. Today, many different types of seaweed are used in soups, seasonings and other forms of Japanese cooking. These are the three seaweeds used the most:

Pointe du Hoc

Pointe du Hoc lies on the Normandy coast in the North of France. In 1944 it was part of the biggest sea invasion in history. During the World War 2 planning of the assault on Nazi captured France; Allied commanders noticed the massive coastal guns at Pointe du Hoc. There were six 155mm cannons in heavily armoured bunkers that could be very dangerous to Allied ships. 

Pointe du Hoc had for many months been a target for many air raids by Allied planes flying from English airstrips. The heavy artillery guns were barely damaged by the bombs. Pointe du Hoc was surrounded by steep cliffs that dropped down into the sea. Only at a certain part of the day a very narrow beach would appear at the bottom of the cliffs.
The American 2nd and 5th Ranger divisions had been training with the British commandos for about 5 months and had been climbing the British coastal cliffs for training. To get to the French coastal cliffs they were using LCA and LCVP's or Higgins boats (both were flat bottomed landing crafts made to carry troops onto the beach) manned by British navy sailors. The boats were lowered into the sea a few kilomiters out to sea. The British had added some extra armour to the sides of the landing crafts, exchanging speed and manoverability for protection for the men that were to assault the French coast.
The nearly 100m high cliff was assaulted by the American 2nd and 5th Army Ranger Divisions. Colonel James Earl Rudder led the attack. The assault started at 06.30am when the battleship USS Texas, stopped bombarding Pointe du Hoc. Due to harsh weather conditions, the Rangers drifted off course and spent an additional half hour in reaching the beach. By then the Germans had come out of their bunkers and set up defensive positions along the ridge of the cliff. The landing craft doors were opened and the men of the two divisions stormed the beach. The soldiers used ropes attached to rocket propelled grappling hooks to climb the cliffs. The ropes and grappling hooks were carried in a wooden box held by two soldiers. The soldiers also used ladders that were attached to landing crafts and grappling hooks that were shot up from the boats.

When the Rangers reached the top, small groups of soldiers assaulted the German positions. After reaching the gun emplacement bunkers, the Rangers found that they were no longer there. The guns were later found and destroyed in a field a bit inland.

At the end of the assault, the Rangers were forced to defend Pointe Du Hoc from constant counterattacks until they were relieved by the 5th Army Corps coming from a neighboring beach. Out of the 225 original attackers only 90 remained.

<doc id="243492" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=243492" title="Entoprocta">
Entoprocta

Entoprocta, or Kamptozoa, is a phylum of tiny sessile aquatic animals ranging from 0.1 to 7 millimetres (0.004 to 0.28 in) long. Mature individuals are goblet-shaped, on relatively long stalks. They are filter-feeders, with a crown of tentacles whose cilia generate water currents towards the mouth. Both the mouth and anus lie inside the crown. The superficially similar Bryozoa (Ectoprocta) have the anus outside a 'crown' of hollow tentacles. Most families of entoprocts are colonial, and all but 2 of the 150 species are marine. A few solitary species can move slowly.

Some species eject unfertilized ova into the water while others keep their ova in brood chambers until they hatch, and some of these species use placenta-like organs to nourish the developing eggs. After hatching, the larvae swim for a short time and then settle on a surface. There they metamorphose, and the larval gut generally rotates by up to 180°, so that the mouth and anus face upwards. Both colonial and solitary species also reproduce by cloning.

Some species of nudibranchs (sea slugs) and flatworms prey on entoprocts. A few entoproct species have been found living in close association with other animals. 

Fossils of entoprocts are very rare and the earliest specimens that have been identified with confidence date from the Late Jurassic. Most studies from 1996 onwards have regarded entoprocts as members of the Trochozoa, which also includes molluscs and annelids. However, a study in 2008 concluded that entoprocts are closely related to bryozoans.

'Entoprocta' means 'anus inside'. The alternative name 'Kamptozoa', means 'bent' or 'curved' animals. Some authors use "Entoprocta", while others prefer "Kamptozoa".

5000 metres

The 5000 metres (about 3.1 mi or 16,404 ft) is a popular running distance. It is also known as a 5K or 5 km. Colloquially it is called a "five-K". It is one of the track events in the Olympic Games and the World Championships in Athletics. "5000 metres" refers to racing on a track. "5K" usually refers to a roadrace or cross country event. While mainly run as an outdoor event, the 5000 m is sometimes run on an indoor track. Official records are kept for both outdoor and indoor 5000 m track events, but not for 5 km road races.

Much of the distance's popularity is due to the challenge it gives to both amateurs and professionals. It is a distance race that demands a great deal of endurance as well as speed. Strategies also play a key role, and the combination makes it attractive to many.

<doc id="243545" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=243545" title="Oakwell">
Oakwell

Oakwell is a sports development in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England. It is used mostly by Barnsley Football Club for playing their home games, It is also used by their reserve team.

While the name "Oakwell" is usually used for the main stadium, it also includes several neighbouring venues which form the facilities of the Barnsley F.C. academy. This includes an indoor training pitch, a smaller stadium with seating on the south and west sides for around 2,200 spectators, and several training pitches used by the different Barnsley FC squads.

Until 2003 the stadium and the large amount of land that is around it was owned by Barnsley Football Club. However after falling into administration in 2002 the council purchased the main Oakwell Stadium. This allowed the club to pay its creditors and remain participants in The Football League.

The West Stand is the only original part of Oakwell Stadium left standing, however it was made 'all-seater' in 1995. 

The stand is made up of two tiers, only the upper tier is covered but at the expense of several supporting columns for the roof structure, the seats are the originals from the early 1900s, from here you get a decent view with moderate legroom. In spite of the restricted views and modest facilities, the West Stand remains a popular vantage point for many fans. The lower tier of the West Stand is uncovered and offers a great view of the action.

The roof of the West Stand is corrugated iron this also houses the main television gantry which is accessed from the upper level seating area by a temporary ladder.

At the end of the 1990s, the then-stadium owners Barnsley Football Club were considering re-developing the West Stand after several seasons of high attendances. However with the rapid decline in fortunes of the football club, and sale of the stadium and new club ownership these plans are unlikely to happen in the near future.

The stand also has a traditional players tunnel in the centre. This is used for access to some of the facilities underneath the stand. The main players tunnel now comes out from the north-west corner following the moving of the changing rooms to the North Stand.

The West Stand has a total seating capacity of 4,752.

The East Stand is a two level development completed in 1993. Funded in part by the football trust, the stand has a capacity of 7,492 and replaced a large covered terrace known as the Brewery Stand. The East Stand was designed by NYP Architects,as was the North Stand and the Corner Stand. With the completion of the East Stand, Barnsley FC became the first football club in Yorkshire to add 'executive boxes' into their stadium. The East stand is very modern, and has plenty of legroom.

Due to the sloped land on which Oakwell Stadium is built, the rear of the East Stand is much taller than it is from the pitchside. This means a climb to the upper level seating area requires many more steps than a spectator may anticipate. However several lifts are available.

Built in 1995, CK Beckett is the current name for what is traditionally known as the 'Pontefract Road End' or 'Ponty End'. Some fans continue to call it the 'ORA Stand' - in reference to the original sponsors of it. Also, known as the Van Damme Stand.

With a capacity of 4,508, The CK Beckett Stand is a large covered single tier seating area behind the goal on the south side of the stadium.

This part of the stadium also houses the players gym, the club superstore, box office, and general administration offices.

It is understood that this stand had been designed specifically with future development in mind, therefore should the club ever have the need to increase the grounds capacity then it would be fundamentally possible to add a second tier without making any major alterations to the existing structure.

The North Stand is the most recent addition to Oakwell Stadium and is a large covered singled tiered seating area with a capacity for 6,000 spectators.

As this stand is generally reserved for away supporters its capacity is rarely utilized, although during the 2006/07 season, Sheffield Wednesday, Derby, Birmingham and Sunderland fans all filled the end, Sunderland also took up half of the West Stand. In the 2009/10 season, Newcastle United filled the stand.

At a cost of £4.5 million (including several academy facilities that it accommodates), it has been a cause for debate ever since its construction. However at the time it was built, Barnsley FC had only just been demoted from the FA Premier League and were planning for a possible return.

The Corner Stand was built in the summer of 1998. It was originally known as 'The Welcome Windows Stand'. It is an unusual three level structure. It provides further executive areas and disabled facilities for viewing an event.

Access to this area was also added into the neighbouring East Stand on several levels. The spectator capacity of the structure is 202.

In recent years Oakwell Stadium has rarely been used by anyone other than Barnsley FC. The occasional celebrity charity football match has been played there.

Wakefield Trinity Wildcats Rugby League Club used the stadium for their first game in the Super League (Europe) in 1998.

Non-league football club Wakefield and Emley used the stadium for an FA Cup tie against Rotherham in 1998, choosing a larger neutral venue as opposed to the traditional option of 'switching' the tie to the home of the team which was drawn away.

Premier League side Manchester City used the stadium for their first qualifying round UEFA Cup game in July 2008. This was because the pitch at the City of Manchester Stadium was not ready for football games after the summer's boxing and music concerts.

In March 2008, club secretary Don Rowing revealed that the West Stand would be demolished and rebuilt. Given that the average gate at Barnsley accounts for less than 50% of capacity this appeared to be a strange announcement, however there are a number of structural concerns with the roof and the wooden floor of the upper tier and it would seem that a new structure is more financially viable than maintaining the existing one.

No firm timescales or details of the structure have yet been released. Plans for a replacement stand were submitted to the local council several years ago, in this particular case the stand was to have around 9,000 seats - it remains to be seen whether such a large stand would be built. Given the current attendance figures then a new stand with around the same capacity as the existing West Stand would be more than viable.

On 27 December 1920, Horace Fairhurst, a young full-back for the visiting Blackpool, received a blow to the head during a league game. He died at home eleven days later as a result of the injury.

The Particle Theory of Matter means that all matter is made of tiny particles. The particles have empty spaces between them, and they move randomly (anywhere) all the time. After that, the particles move faster and move father apart when heated, and they attract (want to come together) each other.

Has a shape and volume, the particles are in motion, but attraction is strong, the particles want to stay together and they just vibrate (move in place).

The particles are farther apart than a solid, they can move, they are free to move past each other, but they still hold together from attraction.

The particles are much farther apart, and they are free to move, the attraction is small and they spread out to fill the whole container

Involuntary celibacy

Involuntary celibacy or (incel) is the word for someone who does not have sexual intercourse, but wants to. This is different to clergy in some religions for whom taking a vow of celibacy is a condition of their post. An "involuntary celibate" is someone who suffers from involuntary celibacy. The phrase means involuntary, as in doesn't want to, and celibacy, which is not being in a relationship. People who are incel often try to attract a mate and improve, but don't get the opportunities to. An incel is someone who is without a relationship for a long period of time, while someone who is single for a few months is not an incel.

Some problems caused by incel are depression, frustration, and loneliness. In society today, it is usually expected for people to have had sexual encounters many times. Peer pressure can make this worse, and can make incels more likely to kill themselves. The longer a person is incel, the worse the problems become, and incels have a higher death rate than normal people. 

Incel can be caused by not enough social skills, charisma, disabilities, and other things like homelessness. One large cause is shyness. This is because men are usually supposed to ask women out, and few women like shy men, so shy men won't have many dates. Other causes are more physical, like looks, as beautiful people are more likely to date than ugly people. Lack of money, resources and popularity make it difficult for some men to find women who are attracted to them.

Manchester City Council

Manchester City Council is the local government for Manchester. Manchester is a city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester, England. It is made up of 96 councillors. There are three for each of the 32 wards. Currently the council is controlled by the Labour Party. It is led by Sir Richard Leese. Much of the council and local civil service is located at Manchester Town Hall and the Town Hall Extension, in the city's commercial centre.

Manchester was incorporated in 1838 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 as the Corporation of Manchester or Manchester Corporation. It gained city status in 1853. It was only the second such grant since the Reformation. Under the Local Government Act 1972 the council was reconstituted as a metropolitan borough council in 1974. The area included in the city has been increased many times. In 1885 (Bradford, Harpurhey and Rusholme), 1890 (Blackley, Crumpsall, part of Droylsden, Kirkmanshulme, Moston, Newton Heath, Openshaw, and West Gorton), 1903 (Heaton), 1904 (Burnage, Chorlton cum Hardy, Didsbury, and Moss Side), 1909 (Gorton, and Levenshulme), 1931
(Wythenshawe: Baguley, Northenden, and Northern Etchells), and Ringway. A new Town Hall was opened in 1877 (by Alderman Abel Heywood) and the Mayor of Manchester was granted the title of Lord Mayor in 1893.

Elections are usually by thirds. A third of the seats elected, three years in every four. In the 2004 elections, due to a lot of boundary changes (which involved the total number of councillors reduced) all seats were contested.

The council has been controlled by the Labour Party since its reconstitution in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972.

The Shield : red (Gules) with three gold (Or) bands drawn diagonally across to the right hand side. The white (Argent) top segment (the Chief), shows a ship at sea in full sail. This is a reference to the city's trading base. Crest : On a multicoloured wreath stands a terrestrial globe, signifying Manchester's world trade, and covered by a swarm of flying bees. The bee was adopted in the 19th century as a symbol of industry—Manchester being the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution. Supporters : On the left a heraldic antelope with a chain attached to a gold (Or) collar, representing engineering industries, and hanging at the shoulder, the red rose of Lancashire, in which county Manchester once was. On the right a golden lion stands guardant (facing us), crowned with a red (Gules) castle (a reference to the Roman fort at Castlefield from which the city originated). The lion also wears the Lancashire Rose. Motto : "Concilio et Labore"--loosely translated "By wisdom and effort" (or 'By counsel and hard work').

Lord Don't Slow Me Down is a rockumentary film. It looks back on British band Oasis' "Don't Believe the Truth" world tour. The tour took place from May 2005 to March 2006. The film is directed by Baillie Walsh. It went platinum in the UK.

A handful of fans-only private screenings took place around the world. The world premiere of the film at the Directors Guild Theater in New York City on 4 November 2006 as part of the CMJ Film Festival. The UK television premiere was on Channel 4 on 19 November, at 11:50pm. It was a heavily edited version with about 40 minutes cut from the original 95 minute version. The film was first shown to go along with Oasis' compilation album "Stop the Clocks", released on 20 November 2006. A preview of the film was included on the Let There Be Love DVD single, released in November 2005.

The film features a new Oasis song also called "Lord Don't Slow Me Down", written by Noel Gallagher and recorded during the Don't Believe the Truth sessions. Gallagher described it as being ""one of the best things, like The Who, The Yardbirds and the Jeff Beck Group combined, and it's got two drum solos on it!"". He has also said that his girlfriend thought it was the only Oasis song you could dance to. The song was left off "Don't Believe the Truth" because Gallagher felt that including it would have meant he'd have been singing too many songs on the record. Italian footballer Alessandro Del Piero also appears in the video signing a shirt for Noel.

"Lord Don't Slow Me Down" was released on DVD on 29 October 2007. The DVD set contents:

This template is placed in the main MediaWiki namespace notices named , and so on. See for the full list of namespace numbers. Then this template needs no parameter.

When a page is edited this template often displays red or blue links at the top of the edit page looking like this:

Or like this:

Those links are to the group and page editnotices of the page. Admins and accountcreators always see both links, even if the notices have not yet been created, since they can create and edit the editnotices. Normal users only see the red "Page notice" link on their own user and user talk basepage, since they can create and edit such notices. Normal users also see blue links to group and page notices if they already have been created, so they can find and view the source code of the notice. But normal users still can't edit those notices, except the ones in userspace.

The editnotices are also displayed when a user "views the source" of a protected page. (When a non-admin tries to edit a fully protected page, or when an IP-user tries to edit a semi or fully protected page.) The group and page notices are displayed, but not the namespace notices. 

Most editnotices have useful information even when just viewing the source of a protected page, but in some cases we want to display different information to users who are just viewing the source of the page. This template feeds "codice_1" to the editnotices it loads when in view mode. This can be used inside the editnotices like this:
