Vengeance: Night of Champions

Vengeance: Night of Champions was the seventh yearly professional wrestling pay-per-view event by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) with the name Vengeance. It featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands. The event took place on June 24, 2007 at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas. Every match on the card was contested for a championship. This event was notable for being on the weekend of the Chris Benoit double murder and suicide case. Benoit, who was originally booked to wrestle CM Punk for the vacant ECW World Championship, did not come to the event due to "personal reasons."

The main event featured the Raw brand. John Cena defended the WWE Championship against Mick Foley, Bobby Lashley, Randy Orton, and King Booker. Cena won the match and kept the WWE Championship after pinning Foley following an FU. The main match from the SmackDown brand was a "Last Chance match" for the World Heavyweight Championship between Edge and Batista, which Edge won by countout. The main match from the ECW brand was CM Punk versus Johnny Nitro for the vacant ECW World Championship, which Nitro won by pinfall after performing a corkscrew neckbreaker from the middle rope.

The main feud on the Raw brand going into the event was between John Cena, Bobby Lashley, King Booker, Mick Foley, and Randy Orton over the WWE Championship. The feud began when Lashley was drafted to the Raw brand and stripped of the ECW World Championship. After being stripped of the title, Lashley began to pursue the WWE Championship. On the June 18 episode of "Raw", Foley, Orton, Booker, and Lashley all said why they deserve to be the number-one contender to the WWE Championship. Cena also said who he believed deserved to be the number-one contender to the championship. Following this, Interim General Manager Jonathan Coachman announced that all five men would compete for the title in a match called the "WWE Championship Challenge" at Vengeance.

The main feud going into Vengeance on the SmackDown brand was between Edge and Batista over the World Heavyweight Championship. Their match was a rematch from their Steel cage match at One Night Stand, the pay-per-view three weeks before Vengeance, where Edge won by escaping the cage. On the June 8 episode of "SmackDown", WWE Chairman Vince McMahon announced that Edge would be defending the World Heavyweight Championship against Batista in a "Last Chance" match at Vengeance. On the June 22 episode of "SmackDown!", Batista and Ric Flair beat Edge and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP). During the match, Flair and MVP brawled outside the ring, leaving Edge on his own against Batista. Batista gained the pinfall after giving a Batista Bomb to Edge.

The feud between The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) and Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch began at Backlash. At the event, The Hardys beat Cade and Murdoch to keep the World Tag Team Championship. At the next event, Judgment Day, Matt and Jeff beat Cade and Murdoch again to keep the title. On the June 4 episode of "Raw", Cade and Murdoch beat The Hardys to win the title.

Young Poland

Young Poland (in Polish: "Młoda Polska") is a period modernist of Polish art, literature and music. This period covered about the years since 1890 until 1918. It was one of the effects of the strong opposition to the ideas of the positivism and developed the nature of decadence, of neoromanticism, of symbolism, of impressionism, and of the Art Nouveau. 

The expression was known after one of the manifestos written by Artur Górski. The manifesto was published in the daily (newspaper) "Życie" ("Life"), seated in Cracow, in the year 1898, and was immediately accepted in all the parts of the divided Poland, by analogy with other similar expressions as Young Germany, Young Belgium, Young Scandinavia and so on.

Polish literature of the period was based on two main understandings: 

Other important writers of the period were:

In music, the expression "Young Poland" is put into use to an informal group of composers which include Karol Szymanowski, Grzegorz Fitelberg, Ludomir Różycki and probably also Mieczysław Karłowicz. This group worked under the strong influence of the neoromanticism of the music, and especially of composers from another countries as Richard Strauss and Richard Wagner. The composers would be also strong links with the The Five, a group of composers Russian which included Modest Musorgski, Alexander Borodin and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.

In the period of the Young Poland there weren't great artistic currents in the Polish art. The painters and the sculptors attempted to continue in the romantic tradition, in bringing new ways of expression already popular in another countries. The more influential current was the Art Nouveau, even if the Polish artists started attempting also new forms of national style. The sculptura just like the painture of the period were strongly influenced by all the forms of the symbolism.

Hurricane Cesar-Douglas

Hurricane Cesar-Douglas was a Category 4 hurricane that crossed the Atlantic as Hurricane Cesar. The storm continue to move west to the Pacific as Hurricane Douglas. The storm was the strongest storm for the 1996 Pacific hurricane season. It was the second hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season, in the Atlantic it was a category 1.

The start of this storm goes back to a tropical wave near Dakar, Senegal. It crossed the Atlantic and did not start until it was close to the Windward Islands. On July 24 it became Tropical Depression Three. Tropical Depression Three became Tropical Storm Cesar on July 25. Cesar did not strengthen much because it was close to land. It did start to strengthen more as it entered the Southwestern Caribbean Sea. After about half way between Nicaragua and South America, Tropical Storm Cesar became a hurricane on July 27. Hurricane Cesar reached its highest winds on July 28, which were at 85 mph. Later that day, Hurricane Cesar made landfall near Bluefields, in Nicaragua while it still had its highest winds. Cesar weakened into a tropical storm over Central America. But it did survive crossing Central America. 

Late on July 28, Cesar reached the Pacific Ocean and was renamed Tropical Storm Douglas. By the next day, Tropical Storm Douglas became a hurricane. Later, on August 1, Hurricane Douglas reached its highest wind, which were at 130 mph. Douglas started getting weaker because of cooler waters. On August 5, Hurricane Douglas died.

The name "Cesas" was retired and the name "Douglas" was not retired. In 2002 and 2008 the name Cristobal was used instead, it was not retired. For the Pacific, the name "Douglas" used in 2002 and 2008, it still wasn't retired.

Georg Solti

Sir Georg Solti (pronounce: “George Shollti”), (born Budapest, 21 October, 1912; died Antibes, France, 5 September, 1997) was a Hungarian conductor who later became a naturalized British citizen. 

Solti was born "György Stern" in Budapest to a Jewish family. His father changed his name from "György" to "Georg" and changed his family name to "Solti". This was so that his name did not look Jewish, because there was a lot of antisemitism in Europe.

He learned the piano but, when he was 14, he heard Erich Kleiber conduct Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 and he immediately wanted to be a conductor. He studied at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, under Béla Bartók, Zoltán Kodály, Leo Weiner and Ernst von Dohnanyi. By 1935 he was becoming known as a conductor. He conducted "The Marriage of Figaro" at the Budapest Opera in 1938. It was the first time he had conducted there, and it was also to be the last time. That very day, Hitler annexed Austria. Life became dangerous for Jews in Hungary. In 1939 he moved to Switzerland, where he continued a career as a pianist and won the Geneva International Piano Competition, but he did not have many chances to conduct there. His father became ill and died, so he never saw him again.

After World War II Solti became music director of the Bavarian State Orchestra in Munich (where he gave the first performance in Germany of Paul Hindemith's opera "Mathis der Maler", which had been banned when the Nazis were in power. He conducted the Frankfurt Opera where he gave the first performance in Germany of Alban Berg's "Lulu". In 1951 he performed at the Salzburg Festival conducting Mozart's "Idomeneo".

Solti often conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and it was arranged that he would be their main conductor (music director) from 1962. However, Solti changed his mind because they appointed Zubin Mehta as assistant conductor without telling Solti. Mehta became musical director instead.

In 1961 Solti became music director at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and stayed there until 1971. He was a great conductor, but made the musicians work very hard. With his bald head he got the nickname "The Screaming Skull". He spent much of his time in Britain and the United States. 

His first marriage ended in divorce. His second marriage was to Valerie Pitts, a British television presenter whom he met when she was sent to interview him. They had two daughters, Gabrielle and Claudia. He was given an honorary Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1971. The next year he became a British citizen, and was then known as Sir Georg Solti. 

Solti helped many young musicians, training them in workshops and giving them opportunities to perform.

Solti was music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO) from 1969 until 1991, when he was given the title of Music Director Laureate, the only CSO conductor to be given that title. He made them into a world class orchestra and took them on tours to other countries. He gave 999 performances with the CSO. He died before his 1,000th performance. A square near the Symphony Center in Chicago was called "Sir Georg Solti Place" in his memory. 

Solti also had other jobs. He was music director of the Orchestre de Paris from 1972 until 1975. From 1979 until 1983 he was principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra. During this time with the London Philharmonic he performed and recorded many works by Elgar including the two symphonies, the Violin Concerto with Kyung Wha Chung and the Cello Concerto with Julian Lloyd Webber. In 1983 he conducted Wagner's Ring Cycle at Bayreuth for the only time. For the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, Solti formed the World Orchestra for Peace, which consisted of musicians from 47 orchestras around the world.

Solti worked with Dudley Moore on a 1991 television series, "Orchestra!", which was made to explain to people all about the orchestra.

Solti never retired. He had many plans for concerts and recordings when he suddenly died of a heart attack on 5 September 1997 in Antibes, France He was given a state funeral, and was buried next to Bartók who had been his teacher and had helped him a lot. Solti’s widow and daughters began the Solti Foundation to help young musicians.

Toroid Magnets have many applications in electronics and physics. They are usually considered a monopole, although the central axis will have a dipole, and have the advantage of being wound continuously in a single direction, thus there is no inductive interference between windings as in a solenoid that is wound back and forth. The toroid magnet has found some interesting applications beyond the junkyard crane. It has also been used as a means to enhance thrust in rocket motors.

The V2 was designed by Nazis to bomb London, Antwerp and other European cities. It travelled at four times the speed of sound so was impossible to shoot down. Over 3,000 V-2s were used by the German Wehrmacht against Allied targets in World War II, resulting in the death of an estimated 7,250 military personnel and civilians.

The Guardian Legend

"The Guardian Legend" got mixed reviews from "Electronic Gaming Monthly" and "Nintendo Power". People liked the game for how it looked, sounded, and felt. Other people did not like the game because the play was the same. It also had a very long password. The game was not well-known at first, but it is more known now. It is an example of a game where players do different things.

In "The Guardian Legend", the player controls the female guardian of Earth, a "robot transformer"; the Japanese version of the game calls her "Miria". The player is to destroy the alien moon Naju before it gets to Earth. The player needs to turn on the moon's self-destruct device and escape the moon before it gets to Earth. Five alien tribes who try to control the moon stand in the way of the player. To help players along, messages left by a person help guide them in finding the safety switches to turn on the self-destruct device. These messages also help players get to some other rooms.

The player controls the Guardian in human form while walking on Naju's surface, called the "Labyrinth". When in Naju, the Guardian turns into a spaceship in which the player can move around. The Guardian has a life meter that drops when hit by alien attacks. Players can pick up items to help fill the Guardian's life meter again. If the life meter runs out, then the Guardian dies, ending the game. The player can shoot at aliens with different types of weapons by pressing buttons on the gamepad. Players get different and better weapons during play.

Round, colored creatures in the game named "Landers" appear in the game to help players. Landers can help fill the Guardian's life meter and increase the number of times players can fire weapons. Blue Landers may sell weapons to players. They also give out passwords. Passwords let players stop the game and come back to it later.

The player goes through the Labyrinth and find entrances to the Dungeon. The ten safety devices are located in the Dungeon. The Labyrinth is made up of many rooms that are as big as the screen. Players can look at a map to see where they are at. This map can be looked at while the game is paused. Players can either walk from one room to another, or they can go to another room through a "warp panel". Some of these warp panels require the right key to go through. Many rooms contain aliens. Other rooms contain clues, shops, passwords, and entrances to the Dungeon.

The Dungeon contains areas in which the Guardian flies through as a spaceship. The Dungeon has many aliens to destroy. At the end of an area in the Dungeon, there is a boss, a very strong alien that must be destroyed. After destroying the boss, the Guardian flies out of the Dungeon and back into the Labyrinth. The player then gets a power-up. The player may also receive a key for a warp panel. Some entrances to the Dungeon are already open. Other entrances need a certain task completed before going in. Clues in the Labyrinth tell players how to get into these entrances.

"The Guardian Legend" was made for the Famicom and came out in 1988 in Japan. It came out for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in 1989 and in Europe in 1990. The people who created the game were the same who created "Guardic", "Zanac", and "Puyo Puyo".

Reviewers liked the game for its multiple features. Some have compared the game to other Nintendo games like "The Legend of Zelda" and "Metroid". Mike Engler, who made "Retro Game Challenge", said that ""The Guardian Legend" is one of the best games ever released". The game was nominated by "Nintendo Power" magazine in 1989 for "Best Graphics & Sound", "Best Play Control", and "Best Overall" but did not win any of them. Some of the music of the game were remixed.

<doc id="190212" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190212" title="Vengeance (2006)">
Vengeance (2006)

Vengeance (2006) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which happened on June 25, 2006 at the Charlotte Bobcats Arena in Charlotte, North Carolina. It was the sixth yearly Vengeance event. Eight professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's card. The buildup to the matches and the situations that took place before, during, and after the event were planned by WWE's script writers. The event starred wrestlers from the Raw brand: a storyline expansion of the promotion where employees are assigned to a wrestling brand under the WWE banner.

The main event was a 5-on-2 Handicap match, a match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with more people such as three against two, or five against two, between D-Generation X (DX) (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) versus the Spirit Squad (Kenny, Johnny, Mitch, Nicky, and Mikey). Triple H and Michaels won the match after pinning Kenny and Mikey, respectively. Two other matches were on the card. In singles matches, John Cena beat Sabu in an Extreme lumberjack match, which featured wrestlers from the Raw and ECW brands at ringside. The other featured match was for the WWE Championship, in which Rob Van Dam beat Edge to keep his title.

Vengeance made over $400,000 in ticket sales from an attendance of 6,800 and received 320,000 pay-per-view buys, which helped WWE increase its pay-per-view revenue by $21.6 million compared to the year before. When the event was released on DVD, it reached the number one position on "Billboard's" DVD Sales Chart. 

The event had eight professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers played either villains or heros as they followed a series of events, which lead to a wrestling match or series of matches. All wrestlers belonged to the Raw brand – a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a different program, the other two being "SmackDown!" and "ECW".

The main event scripted into Vengeance was between D-Generation X (DX) Triple H and Shawn Michaels versus the Spirit Squad (Kenny <nowiki>[</nowiki>Ken Doane<nowiki>]</nowiki>, Johnny <nowiki>[</nowiki>Johnny Jeter<nowiki>]</nowiki>, Mitch <nowiki>[</nowiki>Nick Mitchell<nowiki>]</nowiki>, Nicky <nowiki>[</nowiki>Nick Nemeth<nowiki>]</nowiki>, and Mikey <nowiki>[</nowiki>Michael Brendli<nowiki>]</nowiki>) in a 5-on-2 Handicap match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with more people such as five against two. The story for the match began after Backlash, Raw's previous pay-per-view event, where The McMahons (Vince and Shane) defeated Michaels and "God" in a tag team match, with help from the Spirit Squad in a no disqualification match, a match where neither wrestler can be disqualified, allowing for weapons and outside interference. For weeks on "Raw", Michaels got revenge on both Vince McMahon and the Spirit Squad, until the May 22 episode of "Raw", where the Spirit Squad were scripted to injure Michaels' left knee. Then, by orders of McMahon, Triple H was to "break Michaels' skull", with a sledgehammer. Triple H failed to do what McMahon ordered and instead attacked the Spirit Squad, thus turning into a hero. Two weeks later, McMahon put Triple H in a gauntlet match, against the Spirit Squad. In the match, Kenny grabbed a steel chair and put it on Triple H's left knee, similar to what the group did to Michaels. Mitch, who was the only member not participating in the match, was thrown out from the backstage curtain by Michaels. Then, Michaels joined Triple H in the ring as they began to beat down the four members of the Spirit Squad. This lead to Michaels and Triple H reforming D-Generation X for the first time since their teased reunion in 2002. That same night, McMahon scheduled the Spirit Squad and D-Generation X in a 5-on-2 handicap tag team match. On the June 19 episode of "Raw", DX marked their return, when the duo humiliated the Spirit Squad as DX dumped green slime onto the group and embarrassed the team afterward, by beating them.

One of the featured matches was between John Cena and Sabu in an Extreme lumberjack match, a standard match with the exception that the ring is surrounded by a group of wrestlers not directly involved in it and competed under hardcore rules. On the television debut of "ECW on Sci Fi" on June 13, a brawl broke out between Rob Van Dam and Edge. Edge, who tried to leave through the ECW crowd, was attacked by Cena, because he caused Cena to lose the WWE Championship at ECW's One Night Stand, and Cena wanted revenge against Edge. Following the attack, Cena went to ringside where he knocked ECW Representative Paul Heyman unconscious, after Heyman awarded the win to Van Dam at One Night Stand. Following the attack, Heyman announced that all ECW superstarts would be at "Raw" the next week. The next week on "Raw", Heyman appeared alongside ECW superstar, Balls Mahoney, who was booked to wrestle Cena in a match. The match was won by Cena after he made Mahoney submit. After the match, Cena was attacked by ECW wrestler, Sabu, who, in the premiere of "ECW on Sci-Fi" won a 10-man Extreme Battle Royal, (a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until only one is left and declared winner) where the winner would face Cena at Vengeance in a match. Sabu beat up Cena and performed a leg drop on him, diving onto Cena and putting him through the Raw announcers' table. The following night on an episode of "ECW on Sci-Fi", Cena went to the ECW locker room, where he challenged Sabu to an Extreme lumberjack match, which Sabu accepted.

The other featured match was between WWE Champion Rob Van Dam defending the title against Edge. The story for the match began on the television premiere of "ECW on Sci-Fi", when Van Dam was awarded the ECW World Heavyweight Championship by Paul Heyman, making Van Dam a double champion by holding both the ECW and WWE Championship. Van Dam's celebration was then interrupted by Edge and his girlfriend, Lita. Edge, who was number one contender for the title, told Van Dam that they both had a lot in common, meaning that they were both Money in the Bank winners and successfully became WWE Champions. Edge ended his speech by giving Van Dam some kind words and then attacking him. On the June 19 episode of "Raw", Van Dam attacked Edge, moments after Edge won a match against Ric Flair.

Sarah Aaronsohn (1890 – October 9, 1917) was a member of Nili (a ring of spies that worked for the British during World War I). She is sometimes called "the heroine of Nili".

After seeing thousands of Armenians being killed and tortured while she was traveling from Istanbul to Haifa, anything that reminded her of Armenians would lead her into a fit of hysteria. She started up Nili with her two brothers and a friend to help the British during World War I.

In September 1917 the Ottomans caught one of her carrier pigeons which they then worked out (decrypted) and found out where she was. After arresting lots of people, the Ottomans tortured Sarah Aaronsohn for four days before she managed to find a gun to shoot herself with. In her last written letter she said that she hopes her activities with Nili would help bring the Jews a home country.

A "dealer's room" is also often popular, and it usually has many people selling unique items related to anime, Japan, or video games. A similar room, called the "artist's alley", is also often available for local and beginning artists to promote themselves and sell their items as well. 

Conventions also have talks about anime, video rooms, and places to meet artists

Most conventions bring famous people to the convention who are called guests. The people who are at the convention can talk to these guests, get autographs, and sometimes take pictures.

The Rugby Union club, Leeds St John's formed in 1870, however in 1895, when many teams broke off to form Rugby League, the club also switched codes. The club played as Leeds RLFC until 1995, when they changed their name to 'Leeds Rhinos'. This was done to mark the start of the Superleague. Many other clubs made similar name changes. Leeds Rhinos have won the Superleague in 2004, 2007, 2008 and 2009.

Leeds Rhinos play at the Headingley Carnegie Stadium, which has both Rugby and Cricket grounds. The rugby stadium has a capacity of 22,500. The stadium is located in the Headingley district of the city and is near both Headingley and Burley Park railway stations.

The club mascot is Ronnie the Rhino, who was introduced when the club changed names.

<doc id="190353" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190353" title="Mixed cropping">
Mixed cropping

Mixed cropping is growing of two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of land. It is also known as multiple cropping. This type of cropping leads to an improvement in the fertility of the soil and hence, increase in crop yield because when the two crops are properly chosen the products and refuse from one crop plant help in the growth of the other crop plant and vice-versa. Mixed cropping is an insurance against crop failure due to abnormal weather conditions.

By planting one line of one crop, then a line of another crop, both crops can get better. In one line a leguminous crop and in another line the crop which is to be planted. So, if one crop takes the nitrogen from the soil , the another leguminous crop fixes the crop.The nitrogen is fixed in the root nodules of the leguminous plants in the form of nitrates (soluble form of nitrogen) . Hence, the fertility of the soil gets maintained. This helps the farmers to produce more and more crops without the nitrogen being depleted from the soil.

Mixed cropping is not the same as crop rotation. In crop rotation you plant different crops in the same field in different years. Some plants add nitrogen to the soil, some take it out. If you would plant the same crop year after year, you wear out your soil.

Multiple-cropping patterns are described by the number of crops per year and the intensity of crop overlap. Double cropping or triple cropping signifies systems with two or three crops planted sequentially with no overlap in growth cycle. Intercropping indicates that two or more crops are planted at the same time, or at least planted so that significant parts of their growth cycles overlap. Relay cropping describes the planting of a second crop after the first crop has flowered; in this system there still may be some competition for water or nutrients. When a crop is harvested and allowed to regrow from the crowns or root systems, the term ratoon cropping is used. Sugarcane, alfalfa, and sudangrass are commonly produced in this way, while the potential exists for such tropical cereals as sorghum and rice. Mixed cropping, strip cropping, associated cropping, and alternative cropping represent variations of these systems. See also Agriculture; Agronomy.

Another simple definition of mixed cropping:

Mixed cropping, also known as inter-cropping or co-cultivation, is a type of agriculture that involves planting two or more of plants simultaneously in the same field. In general, the theory is that planting multiple crops at once will allow the crops to work together. Possible benefits of mixed cropping are to balance input and outgo of soil nutrients, to keep down weeds and insect pests, to resist climate extremes (wet, dry, hot, cold), to suppress plant diseases, to increase overall productivity and to use scarce resources to the fullest degree
Agronomists studying mixed crops have had mixed results determining if yield differences can be achieved with mixed versus monoculture crops. If a combination of say, wheat and chickpeas works in one part of the world, it might not work in another. But, overall it appears that measurably good effects result, when the right combination of crops are cropped together. 
EXAMPLE-
The classic example of mixed cropping is that of the American "three sisters", maize, beans, and curcurbits (squash and pumpkins). These three plants, domesticated at different times, were together an important component of Native American agriculture, historically documented by the Seneca and Iroquois, and probably beginning sometime after 1000 AD. All three seeds are planted in the same hole. The maize provides a stalk for the beans to climb on, the beans are nutrient-rich to offset that taken out by the maize, and the squash grows low to the ground to keep weeds down and water from evaporating from the soil in the heat.

this allows in increase of the produnction thus acting a profit for the farmer and helps him increase his earnings.

Most of the time, cable modems are used to get access to the internet using the cable television network. To do this, cable modems use some channels of the Cable TV network. A cable modem usually translates the signals it receives from Ethernet or USB into Radio frequency channels. With Voice over IP (VoIP) technology, most cable modems can now also provide telephone lines. 

In terms of network technology, a cable modem is a network bridge. It operates at layer 2 of the OSI model.

For this edition interviewed .

Ok, so tell me about yourself, where are you from and what do you do?

Well, I am a secondary school student (high school) from Singapore.

Cool :). I'm in secondary school as well. Tell me how (and when) you discovered Wikipedia and what got you editing here.

Well, at that time Wikipedia was first started, the newspapers ran an article about it.

Of course, I didn't start then

Everything only happened when I saw another article about 3 years back detailing the work of Wikipedians that are secondary school students in Singapore.

One of them is Tdxiang, by the way :)

So, when was your first edit made?
10 March 2007

Oh, looks like that article was dated 2 years back then :P :O

So, an oldie then :). Tell me, what do you like most about Wikipedia?

Well, Wikipedia's aim about allowing everyone access to "the sum of all human knowledge" is indeed a very meaningful one, that is probably one of the things I like the most.

Ok, and what do you like the least about Wikipedia?

Probably all the drama and the bureaucracy. If you just go to EN, you will be overwhelmed by the shockingly high numbers of all kinds of noticeboards.

You've been around for quite a while - what keeps you at Wikipedia?

Well, if no one stays around, the project will collapse in no time; I wouldn't want that kind of thing to happen.

Ok. What change would you like to see most in WP?

Well, Wikipedia has now been made a very stressful environment, based on the point of view of others. Some of us need to remember that Wikipedia is a place where people volunteer to improve articles, not a place where you are heavily scrutinised.

Any last things you'd like to say, shout-outs etc.?

Well, I don't think I have anything much to say (sorry I am not exactly chatty) :P

Ok, thanks for your time.

No problem :)

Well thanks for that Chenzw! Look out for more QandA interviews in future editions!

Ichi the Killer

Ichi the Killer is a Japanese movie by Takashi Miike. It was based on the manga by Hideo Yamamoto.

Ichi the Killer is a Japanese film about a man named Kakihara who is part of a Japanese gang. He enjoys giving and receiving pain. When his gang boss goes missing, Kakihara is angry because he thinks nobody else will be able to give him as much pain and pleasure as his boss did. It turns out Kakihara's boss was murdered by a violent killer called Ichi (Japanese for the number one). 300 million yen was stolen by the group that arrived to clean the mess up. Kakihara has convinced himself that his boss is alive and tortures a member of a rival gang for information. The man turns out to be innocent and Kakihara is kicked out of his gang. 
Kakihara hears about Ichi and becomes excited at the idea of somebody who can inflict more pain on him than his boss ever could. Kakihara becomes obsessed with finding Ichi. 

He finally meets Ichi at the end of the movie. He is surprised and disgusted that Ichi is not the evil, cold man he imagined. He is a weak and scared teenager that only kills when he becomes upset about something. Ichi fails to kill Kakihara and lies on the floor crying. Kakihara realises Ichi cannot hurt him the way he wanted and tries to commit suicide by sticking pins in his ears. He loses his hearing and looks up to find Ichi jumping at him. Ichi knocks him off the edge of the building and Kakihara falls to his death. When we see Kakihara's body, he is apparently unharmed by Ichi's attacks. It is suggested that Kakihara imagined the attack as a result of poking his brain with the needles and fell off the building.

Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence

Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, (November 29, 1338 — October 7, 1368), born in Antwerp, was the third son of Edward III. When he was only a child he was married to Elizabeth de Burgh (d.1363), daughter of William de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster (d.1332). The ceremony took place on August 15, 1342, at the Tower of London. He became properly married to her in 1352, when he was aged 14, and took over all her lands in Ireland. The famous English poet, Geoffrey Chaucer, was a page to Elizabeth.

He was Edward III's representative in England and in 1355 he was made the Earl of Ulster. He went to Dublin in 1361 to be the Chief Governor of Ireland. His father made him Duke of Clarence in 1362, and tried to have him made King of Scotland. Lionel and the government in Dublin were concerned about how the English settlers in Ireland were slowly become Irish. He brought in laws, the Statute of Kilkenny, in 1366, which made it against the law:

Lionel found it difficult to get control over Ireland and went back to England in 1367.

After the death of Elizabeth, Lionel married Violante, the daughter of Galeazzo Visconti, Lord of Pavia (d.1378), in Milan during June 1368. While travelling around Italy, Lionel became sick and died at Alba on October 7, 1368. He was buried at the Clare Priory, Suffolk, England.

His daughter, Philippa Plantagenet, married Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March (1351-1381), in 1368. This made Lionel an ancestor of Edward IV.

The Statute of Kilkenny were a set of laws made by the English in 1367 to try and save the English colony in Ireland. The laws were made by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence. The were passed at a meeting of the Irish parliament held at Kilkenny.

The English had difficulty in taking over Ireland. The first English settlers, the Anglo-Irish, began to become Irish in the way the viewed the world. They began to put their own interests ahead of those of the English royalty. The government of Ireland had become weak after the battles with Edward Bruce, and the arrival of the Black Death weakened the country even more. Edward III of England became concerned that the Anglo-Irish were becoming too powerful and threatened his rights and interests in Ireland. He attempted three times to control their increasing independence.

Edward III finally sent his third son, Lionel of Antwerp, to Ireland to try and get back control. He was very concerned that the Anglo-Irish had become more Irish than the Irish themselves. The Statute of Kilkenny were laws designed to bring Ireland back under the control of English born nobles, not English descendants in Ireland. These laws were serious, to break one was seen as treason and could be punished by death.

The Statute of Kilkenny had a lot of laws made to separate the English from the Irish. It was against the law for the English in Ireland to:

Because of the weak government, they were not able to make people obey the new laws, and the Anglo-Irish ignored them.

Template:Google custom/doc

Creates a Google custom search link, which searches one site (and, optionally, pages with URLs containing one directory path in the site). (If you want to search on the entire Web, use instead.) This template takes three unnamed input parameters; you must supply the first one, and the last two are optional.


The template allows for some very flexible searching on entire Web sites, Wikipedia , and within Wikipedia.

Wikipedia has many (a.k.a. discussion pages) and other project pages that behave similarly (such as the , the , the , as well as announcement pages such as the ). High-volume talk pages typically have consisting of subpages. The template can search on any set of archive pages that follows the right naming structure (many if not most archives on Wikipedia do).

, Wikipedia's internal search became able to search on subpage trees. uses this new Wikipedia search feature, and works in some cases where Google search does not.

Google searches (both and ) appear to work on the "talk" associated with some non- namespaces (such as Wikipedia talk:), but they do not work on the Talk: namespace associated with s, nor on the User talk: namespace. For example, even a simple Google search for the page: does not return the page on Wikipedia as one of its results. Google does appear to find a copy of that page on somebody's , but not Wikipedia's talk page. The following Google custom searches do not work, either:

Googling for clues: found this blog post by :
which includes a comment posting that says "Google excluded the talk pages from the index". This probably means article talk pages, since Google is still indexing talk pages for non-article pages. therefore will not work on the Talk: namespace.

Wikipedia's internal search can search all of Wikipedia's talk pages. Use to generate a link to search an entire talk namespace, and to search a subpage tree within a talk namespace on Wikipedia.

See Wikipedia's robots.txt file at http://en.wikipedia.org/robots.txt for a list of content that Wikipedia tells search engines such as Google not to index. therefore will not find any content that robots.txt excludes.

If a page was originally at a name that is now a as a result of a , evidently Google continues to index the content at the original page name. For example, the page which is now began as (which is now a redirect to the new page). However, Google continues to index the new page content under the old page name, apparently regarding the new page as a more-recent duplicate.

This is not a problem when you search on all of the English Wikipedia, or on the entire Wikipedia: , but if you try to search on the subpage tree, Google does not find content on subpages that it indexes through redirects that are outside of the tree.

It may be possible to fix this problem by changing redirects such as to . Then the redirect page should not appear to Google to be a duplicate of the content page, at the next time when Google re-indexes Wikipedia. This would slightly inconvenience users who are following links to the redirects, but they would only have to click once more. (As of September 25, 2008 we have not tested this. For research notes, see .)

If you need to create a large number of search links on a particular subset of Wikipedia pages, you can save much typing by making a new template. See and for examples showing how to cut down to make it do one specific kind of custom search. This has been useful for answering questions on the . It may be useful on other high-volume , or on process pages that work like talk pages, where users new to a discussion ask the same questions repeatedly.

Wikipedia:Flood flag

Users should use the flood flag to avoid flushing other edits and actions from the (NC) feed when doing similar, repetitive changes. Such actions must never be controversial, as using the flood flag decreases the amount of oversight they may receive. Abuse of the flood flag is treated as abuse of any tool would be; this can result in removal of the tool and/or . 

Examples of acceptable use would be deleting many spambot pages, or deleting a large number of pages after consensus has been achieved at , or blocking many . Unacceptable uses include attempting to avoid oversight of any controversial action. 

Users may also wish to use the flood flag when performing log actions on large numbers of usernames that are offensive or libelous (ie. bureaucrats renaming accounts, Stewards locking/hiding global accounts, administrators performing local blocks and so on).

In some cases, an administrator may remove the flood flag to force a users' changes to appear in NC. This should be done in cases where the administrator has forgotten to remove it, or when the changes should be seen by default in NC.

The flood flag is set and removed using .

One problem with the flood flag is that users could use it wrongly. If a user is making bad changes or actions, he or she would be able to use the flood flag to prevent them from being seen from "New changes", which is the primary source at which new changes are shown and seen.

Giving the flood flag is , and shown in . Administrators who abuse their admin rights (now including the flood flag) may be sanctioned.

This is intended to replace requesting temporary bot flags from bureaucrats. Users who would otherwise request a temp bot flag may simply flag themselves using the flood right.

Cases where a permanent bot flag should be given remain the same - the user should create a secondary account and request a bot flag as normal. Only temporary bot flags are replaced with this flood flag.

Only administrators can choose whether to use the flood flag or not. On this Wikipedia, it was decided that non-administrators can also use the flood flag. This can only be for a short time, and the user needs to be carefully watched by the administrator who gives the flag, to make sure it is not being used incorrectly and to remove it when done.

I am requesting the de-sysopping of NonvocalScream for his inappropriate block on me the other week. Per the Flood Flag policy, "Unacceptable uses include attempting to circumvent legitimate oversight of any controversial action, regardless of whether it is an administrator task or not." This statement says that if I /had/ used the flood flag whilst my edits were under scrutiny then it would have been unacceptable use. Furthermore, there is no policy saying that flooding is disruption, and indeed the meta page, and now our own, is only a guideline, not a policy, and suggests that admins use it, not that they must, further proving that a block was an inappropriate use of the administrator tools. 15:34, 13 July 2009 (UTC) 



I am at work at the moment, lunchbreak, and don't have much time right now. however, I want to state that I do understand this process is happening. I will not use the tools or take any administrative action until this is done. () 21:30, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

Upper Austria (, ) is one of the nine states or "Bundesländer" of Austria. The capital of this state is Linz. 
Upper Austria borders on Germany and the Czech Republic, as well as on the other Austrian states of Lower Austria, Styria, and Salzburg. With an area of 11,980 km and 1.3 million people, Upper Austria is the fourth-largest Austrian state by land area and third-largest by population.
Most of the large lakes of Upper Austria are situated in the south (Salzkammergut): Almsee, Attersee, die Gosauseen, Hallstätter See, Irrsee, Langbathseen, Mondsee, Offensee, Traunsee and Wolfgangsee. In the Oberinnviertler Seenplatte on the border with Salzburg, you can find small lakes which are very warm in summer: Holzöstersee, Höllerer See, and Ibmer See.
Ager, Alm, Aschach, Donau, Enns, Inn, Krems, Große Mühl, Kleine Mühl, Naarn, Rodl, Salzach, Steyr, Traun, Aist, Antiesen, and Trattnach.

Traditionally the state is divided into four quarters:

Gefreiter is the German, Swiss and Austrian equivalent for Private (OR-2) in the armed services. Gefreiter was the lowest rank to which an ordinary soldier could be promoted. As a military rank it has existed since at least the 16th century. From the 1920s on, "Gefreiter" has expanded into several additional ranks, those being "Obergefreiter", "Hauptgefreiter", "Stabsgefreiter" and "Oberstabsgefreiter". 

A similar rank exists in Russia ("Ефрейтор"; yefreytor, efreitor), Ukraine (Єфрейтор, ; yefreytor, efreitor) and Belarus, and existed in late Soviet Union.

<doc id="190713" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190713" title="Plasma display">
Plasma display

Televisions with plasma display are much thinner than cathode ray tubes and are usually higher definition.

Plasma screens are made of 2 sheets of glass with 2 gases stored between the sheets. The gases are xenon and neon and they fill thousands of tiny chambers, or spaces. Behind each space are a series of red, blue and green phosphors (substances that give off light when struck by light). When electricity connects to the plasma chambers the colored phosphors produce the right color on your screen. They work in a very similar way to fluorescent tubes used for lighting.

Plasma screens may seem to be a new technology but actually they have been around since 1964 but only 2 colors could be produced then. Now we have high definition Plasma screens up to 150 inches in size. Japanese engineers are currently working on a 270 inch model.

Plasma TV's have more pixels (tiny dots that when put together can create an image on a picture) per inch than the old fashioned cathode ray tube (CRT) screens so they can produce a much sharper image. In the old style of CRT screens the pictures were made up of lines. If you look closely at a Plasma screen you will not see any lines. You will find out that most Plasma screens have a wide screen option so you can see movies in the way they were intended for movie theaters. They are also ideal for the latest digital broadcasting methods.

One of the big advantages is the space saving. The problem with old cathode ray tubes is that they needed a lot of space so that the rays can fire upon all areas of the screen. The wider the screen, the larger the volume of the television would be. The average Plasma television is around 6 to 8 inches deep. Moving your Plasma onto the wall can really increase the amount of floor space and they can be looked at from any point in the room (usually 180 degrees)

Plasma screens are also very light especially when compared to a rear projection TV. A 40 inch Plasma TV will weigh from 50 to 80 pounds and provided you purchase a suitable bracket (that can hold the TV up to the wall) they can be hung very easily to a suitable wall. When fixing to the wall you need to make sure you choose a bracket which tells you the highest weight it can carry. Most brackets can be tilted if you want to view from a different angle.

Plasma TV's can display up to 16 million colors so not only are they great for watching TV programs, they also make a good screen for the latest computer games consoles. Most Plasma TV's have inputs for HDMI and laptop computers connections making them ideal to use to display products and sales messages in offices and shops.

You will also find out that they are very easy to watch even on a sunny day or a very bright room. Unlike the old CRT screens they aren't hard to see in bright areas.

Because of the phosphor technology in Plasma TVs (see How Plasma TVs Work), it is possible for traces of an image to be 'burned-in' to the display, meaning you might see little traces of it even while watching other images. This is really only a concern in commercial uses, where images are shown for long-periods of time. Burn-in can generally be avoided by making sure that you do not keep a constant image on the screen for a long time (sometimes as little as 20 minutes), either by turning the television off, or changing the channel.

Although still much brighter than rear-projection TVs, direct view and LCD TVs often are able to provide a brighter picture. Latest generation Plasma TVs have improved on brightness, but a warning is don't view where it is too bright or sunny.

Although Plasma TVs are much lighter and thinner than direct view and rear projection TVs, an LCD TV is lighter and slimmer. LCD TVs use the same technology as used in most laptop computers. You should know that LCD TVs are not really available in the same sizes as Plasma TVs, and if they are, they usually cost much more.

Plasma screen TVs cost much more than CRTs and a little more than LCDs.

Compared to other television technologies, Plasma TVs have a shorter life span. Most Plasma TVs have a life span of 20,000-30,000 hours based on maker's estimates. This life span is commonly referred to as the Plasma TV half-life, as it is the number of hours over which the Plasma TV will lose approximately half of its brightness.

Plasma TVs break easily and it is possible to break them if you are not careful, and the parts are quite easy to damage. You must take a lot of care when moving them.

As technology has been made better, Plasma screens have a much longer life and you should expect 30,000 hours of use. In other words your television would need to be on for 16 hours a day, every day for the next 5 years. By the time your TV needs replacing higher definition models will have become available. Most of us should not be worried as it will give years of enjoyment

When the first Plasma televisions were designed for home use you didn't get much change from $5000 dollars for a basic small model. As the technology has improved and production has increased, prices have been smaller. You can now get a 37 inch model for as little as $1000 or even less so they are great value. Soon buying a CRT television will be a thing of the past as the new digital age is upon us.

The modern hotel has three American and classic European restaurants, and a beauty parlor off the main lobby. Several shops surround the lobby, which has won awards for its original period character. An even more luxurious "hotel within a hotel" in its upper section is known as The Waldorf Towers operated by Conrad Hotels & Resorts.

The hotel has its own railway platform as part of Grand Central Terminal, used by Franklin D. Roosevelt, Adlai Stevenson, and Douglas MacArthur, among others. An elevator large enough for Franklin D. Roosevelt's automobile provides access to the platform.

Farrah Fawcett (February 2, 1947 – June 25, 2009) was an American actress. A multiple Golden Globe and Emmy Award nominee, Fawcett rose to international fame when she first appeared as private investigator Jill Munroe in the TV series "Charlie's Angels" in 1976. Fawcett later appeared off-Broadway to the approval of critics and in highly rated television movies in roles often challenging ("The Burning Bed", "Nazi Hunter: The Beate Klarsfeld Story", "", "Margaret Bourke-White") and sometimes unsympathetic ("Small Sacrifices"). Fawcett was also a pop culture figure whose hairstyle was emulated by millions of young women and whose poster sales broke records, making her an international sex symbol in the 1970s and 1980s. While her impact was particularly strong on the teens of the 1970s, her appeal spreads over multiple generations. She died of anal cancer aged 62 in 2009.

"End date: 21 July 2009, 18:30UTC "
Ok, i've thought about it long and hard for the past few days, and i've decided to give an RfA a go, also after various nudges from various people. I think in the large my edits and admin actions in the past speak for themselves as to why I should re-gain the mop. Granted, i've made some mistakes, but then so has everyone. I admit that the recent debacle regarding flood flag was blown out of proportion - and that I am partly to blame - and I think now that the guidelines around this tool have been made clearer such an incident won't happen again. I understand that people may be apprehensive about re-granting me the tool, and I can fully understand any opposes that there may be because of this. If this fails, it fails, and to be honest i'm not that fussed if it passes or not. I can (and am) still help the encyclopedia in other ways (indeed, i'm turning my attention away from RfDs and discussions and more to content building) if I don't have the tools, and so it's really not a big deal to me. Primarily, I don't have to watch my G6s sitting in the QD cat for hours, nor do I have to patrol new pages without actually being able to click patrolled ;). Please do ask questions, and i'll do my best to answer them all. Anyway, comments please :) 18:30, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

Let me comment on the RfdA quickly (i'll comment on the opposes individually later...), the RfdA was in no way meant as a grudge/get back etc etc. That's not the sort of person I am. I filed the RfdA because I felt that it was the best thing for the wiki. I never expected it to "pass", but knew that the whole Flood Flag mess needed sorting out and that was one of the ways that that needed to be done imo. 19:05, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

The largest homes in Los Angeles and in the United States are in Beverly Hills. These homes can be really large and fancy, to more common and modern homes, and then to smaller homes with less than 3,000 square feet, which is still quite a large area.

In 2007, Coldwell Banker lists Beverly Hills as having the most expensive houses. The houses in Beverly Hills cost a lot. They can cost over 2 million dollars. However the houses are large, spacious, and fancy and that is why a lot of celebrities live there, and also because it is close to Hollywood.

"End date: 20:27, July 21, 2009"
Hey there, this is Shappy, and I'm nominating Fr33kman for bureaucratship. Fr33kman has been an admin at SEWP for four and a half months, and has been a guiding force for the project, showing exemplary calmness and leadership ability. He works hard doing admin duties, with over 500 log actions and almost 4500 edits. Fr33kman knows how to work with consensus, is extremely dedicated to the Encyclopedia (one of our best article reviewers!), and has the experience necessary to become a bureaucrat. I can only see him excelling working with bot flags, renames, and RfXs. 19:52, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

Co-nomination by 19:56, 14 July 2009 (UTC) : I'm co-nominating Fr33kman for bureaucratship because I think that he is a 100% net positive to the simple project. He has lots of ideas to take the wiki forward, he contributes actively in discussions, can determine consensus and is always "fighting" for what is "right" and "just" for the wiki and to make it a better place. As Shappy mentions, he has lots of edits and log actions, proving his worth with the admin tools. He is also a good content editor, article reviewer and is active in many community processes including P(V)GA and DYK. Good luck! 19:56, 14 July 2009 (UTC) 

"Candidate's acceptance:" Thank you both for your kind words. If promoted I will always honour the comminuties trust in me and continue to work as a team with all editors, admins and crats. I accept the nomination. 20:25, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

1. from ()<br> 
Q: For an RFA, could you list a couple of arguments you consider bearing heavy weight and two arguments bearing the weight of a feather with gathering consensus for a candidate so that I get an idea of your ideas? <br>
A: Thank you for your question: If I may, I'll refrain from using specific examples from actual RFAs RFBs that have occurred and rather discuss the types of comments that I think would be helpful and the types of comments that would be less helpful. I believe that thoughtful contributions to an RFA/B that consider the candidates abilities and talks about the qualities that mwould ake them a good candidate or a poor candidate are important, a. For example, talking about how a candidate has done work towards helping with the aims of the project such as mainspace editing (including discussions on article talk pages), article creations (including both major edits and minor edits such as copyediting), taking part in community discussions on , , WP talk pages and their making use of admin-like actions such as rollback, WP:AN, WP:AIV carry a good deal of weight either for or against the candidate. A discussion of their knowledge or lack thereof of the main policies and guidelines would also be useful. Talking about a candidate having a responsible or irresponsible attitude and behavior towards the work we do here and towards other people who edit here or visit is useful to a closing crat. Supports or opposes that deal merely with how popular or unpopular a candidate is without dealing with the persons abilities to perform the role of an admin or bureaucrat would be less helpful. Whether or not a person uses IRC is completely unimportant to the discussion. Simple comments that have no reasons to accompany them (ie: just a signature) are not very helpful at all; but probably also can't just be summarily dismissed either. I would hope people would encourage the person making them to expand on their reasoning. Fly-by comments from totally inactive editors, or comments from very new editors would be listened to but might not carry the same weight as would other comments; it'd be a case-by-case basis. In summary, each election is an individual affair and the reasoning a crat would use to close it should be tailored to that process. Hope this helps. 16:50, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

The Secret Life of the American Teenager

The Secret Life of the American Teenager is an ABC Family drama show. The show is about Amy (played by Shailene Woodley) becoming pregnant at 15 after being pressured into having sex with Ricky Underwood (played by Daren Kagasoff). Amy is also facing the difficulties of her family coming apart, and other problems with her friends and boyfriend "Ben Boykevich" (played by Kenny Baumann).

During the summer at band camp, Amy Juergens meets Richard "Ricky" Underwood, who persuades her into having sex. Amy learns that she has conceived a child at the beginning of the school year. Her best friends "Lauren Treacy" (played by Camille Winbush) and "Madison Cooperstein" (played by Renee Olstead) are the first ones to know about her being pregnant. Madison unknowingly spreads word that Amy is pregnant, and Amy considers abortion before telling her parents. Soon, Amy's younger sister Ashley finds out. After some time during an argument at the Juergens' home, Amy admits to being pregnant and her boyfriend Ben learns too. Ben remains faithful to her during and after her pregnancy. So that the child is not born out of wedlock, Ben and Amy secretly get married illegally.

Meanwhile, Ricky develops relationships with "Adrianne Lee" (played by Francia Raisa), "the school slut" and "Grace Bowman", a spunky, innocent girl. Ricky gets Adrianne to have sex, but fails trying to have sex with Grace, who had wanted to save herself for marriage to her on-and-off boyfriend "Jack Pappas" who betrayed her by sleeping with Adrianne. 

Amy's parents, "George Juergens" (played by Mark Derwin) and "Anne Juergens" (played by Molly Ringwald) start having tensions and get a divorce.
After the divorce of Anne and George, Amy's child is born. The baby was named John by Ashley because it was a "clean simple name, his life would already be complicated enough". Ashley and her father (George) moved in together in a house next door, and Anne is expecting a baby boy of her own after she slept with her new boyfriend, David. The baby turns out not to be David's, but it's George's. George and Anne will move back in together, which Amy does not like. Amy's nemesis Adrianne is moving into George's old house, which Amy does not like either because Adrian only wants to spy on her boyfriend, Ricky, and Amy. Amy does not want Adrianne near her baby.

Grace has sex with her boyfriend Jack against her father's will. After that Marshall Bowman passes away in a jet crash and Grace lives in misery thinking she killed her father by sleeping with Jack. She thinks God is punishing her. She starts a teen abstinence group (TAG) and a dead parents club. 

Meanwhile, Ben Boykevich wants to go to Bologna, Italy for the summer to work. Amy feels insecure, because she is worried Ben might fall in love with someone else. Amy wants to go, but can not because she has to care for John. Since she can not go, she wants Ben to stay where she can keep any eye on him, but Ben goes to Italy anyway. When he comes back, his personality is changed and Amy thinks that Ben slept or fell in love with someone else. When she asks Ben if he fell in love in Italy, he says no but Amy thinks he's lying, and she thinks Adrianne might know whether he is telling the truth or not. This sparks part of Amy's hatred for Adrianne.

Ben's dad falls in love with a former prostitute named Betty, but Ben does not trust her at first, because he thinks Betty is only in love with his dad for his money. Betty tries to relate to Ben, but Ben is uneasy because Amy does not like Betty either. Betty tries to reassure Ben that she loves his Dad for his heart and not his money, and Ben decides to give her a chance.

Alfred, Lord Tennyson

Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, FRS (6 August 1809 – 6 October 1892) was Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom in the Victorian era. He remains one of the most popular poets in the English language.

Tennyson was excellent at writing short lyrics like "In the valley of Cauteretz", "Break, break, break", "The Charge of the Light Brigade", "Tears, idle tears" and "Crossing the Bar". Much of his verse was based on classical mythological themes, although "In Memoriam A.H.H." was written to commemorate (remember) his best friend Arthur Hallam, a fellow poet and classmate at Trinity College, Cambridge, who was engaged to Tennyson's sister, but died from a cerebral hemorrhage before they were married. Tennyson also wrote some notable blank verse including "Idylls of the King", "Ulysses", and "Tithonus". During his career, Tennyson attempted drama, but his plays were not very successful.

Edward Downes

Sir Edward Downes, (born Birmingham, England, 17 June 1924; died Switzerland, 10 July 2009) was an English conductor. He was famous for conducting opera, but also conducted orchestral concerts. He worked a lot with the orchestra of the Royal Opera House as well as Opera Australia.

When he was old he was almost totally blind and deaf and his wife was dying of cancer, so they both decided that they wanted to die together. They went to Switzerland where they were allowed to commit assisted suicide.

Downes was born in Birmingham, England. His father worked in a bank. He left school when he was 14 and got a simple job in a gas store where he earned 16s 10d (16 shillings and 10 pence, which is 84p in modern British money) a week. 

He had been playing the piano and violin since he was five. When he was 16 he got a scholarship to the University of Birmingham where he studied English literature and music, and began playing the cor anglais. He then got a scholarship to study conducting at the University of Aberdeen.

In the 1960s, he married Joan, a dancer with the Royal Ballet. She later became a choreographer and television producer. They had two children: a son, Caractacus (born December 1967), who became a musician and recording engineer, and a daughter, Boudicca, who became a video producer.

In 1952 he started his work in the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden where he was assistant to Rafael Kubelík. He worked for the ROH for 17 years, becoming Associate Music Director in 1991. 

From 1970 he was Music Director of Australian Opera. He conducted the first performance in the new Sydney Opera House in 1973 conducting Prokofiev’s opera "War and Peace". He was Chief Conductor of the Netherlands Radio Orchestra and the BBC Philharmonic.

Downes was remembered in particular for conducting music by British composers. He was also especially fond of the operas by Verdi as well as the symphonies of Shostakovich. People often thought he looked like Shostakovich, especially when he wore his glasses.

He received the honour of CBE.

In his last years he could hardly see and so he could only conduct music that he knew from memory.

When he was 85 he had become almost totally blind and deaf. His wife was dying of cancer and was in a lot of pain. They both wanted to die together, but in Britain it is against the law to help someone to die, so they decided to go to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland. There, surrounded by members of their family, they drank a fatal dose of barbiturates and died on 10 July 2009.

Some people who support the idea of assisted suicide are hoping that this case may lead to more discussion which could bring about a change in the law in Britain and other countries.

Assisted suicide

Assisted suicide is when somebody who wants to commit suicide (wants to die) is helped to do this by someone else. Normally, people who ask for assisted suicide are very ill and in a lot of pain, so they want someone to help them to die, for example by being given access to drugs which will kill them. Some people prefer the terms aid in dying or death with dignity to describe assisted suicide. The term euthanasia is sometimes used, although euthanasia is generally regarded as different to assisted suicide, as it involves causing a person to die rather than helping them to kill themselves.

The law about this varies a lot in different countries. In Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and in three American states it is legal to help someone to die in these circumstances. However, in many countries it is not allowed, and the person who helps someone to die may be arrested and sent to prison.

Some people who are very ill and want to die may go to these countries, such as Switzerland, in order to end their life.

Dignitas (euthanasia group)

Dignitas is a Swiss group that helps people with assisted suicide (euthanasia). This means that, if a person is very ill and wants to die, the doctors and nurses help them to end their life. Only people who have a terminal illness or very bad physical or mental illnesses are allowed to be helped. The patients must be able to understand what is happening and decide for themselves that death is what they want.

Dignitas was started in 1998 by Ludwig Minelli, a Swiss lawyer. The law in Switzerland says that someone can help in an assisted suicide so long as they do not have any self-interest (for example, so long as they are not going to inherit money from the person who dies). The doctor has to meet the person on two occasions and make sure that the person really does wish to die. There must be evidence for this, i.e. the patient has to sign a paper, and two witnesses have to sign to say they saw the patient signing. If the patient is too ill to sign, a video film can be made. The patient is asked several times whether that is what they want. If everyone is absolutely sure, then he or she is given a drug which will kill them.

Some people travel from other countries such as Britain to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland so that they can be helped to die. For example, the rugby player Daniel James, who was 23, had a terrible injury to his spine which left him paralysed from his chest down, travelled there with his parents to die. In 2009 the British conductor Edward Downes and his wife both travelled to Dignitas where they died together.

Terminal illness

Terminal illness is a term used to describe an illness which cannot be cured and will almost definitely end in the death of the patient. The term is mostly used for progressive diseases such as cancer or advanced heart disease. Someone who has a terminal illness may be described as a terminal patient or as being terminally ill. Usually a patient is called "terminally ill" when they are not expected to live more than 6 months. Diseases such as AIDS are not called terminal illnesses because the patient may live for many years before eventually dying of the illness.

Very often, terminally ill patients are given palliative care to give them a better quality of life. Sometimes they go to a hospice to be looked after.

Ralph Downes

Ralph Downes (born Derby, 16 August 1904; died London, 24 December 1993) was an English organist and organ designer.

He was assistant organist at Southwark Cathedral from 1923 until 1925. Then he continued his education at Keble College, Oxford. He was music director and organist of the new chapel at Princeton University between 1928 and 1935. During his time in America he learned a lot about organ building and listened to musicians playing baroque music.

He soon became famous for his recitals and radio broadcasts in which he played music using historical performance styles. He gave first performances of pieces by composers such as Darius Milhaud, Paul Hindemith and Arnold Schoenberg. Benjamin Britten invited him every year to perform at the Aldeburgh Festival.

In 1948, he was asked to design an organ for the new Royal Festival Hall. When the organ was first played in 1954 not everyone agreed that it was good, but soon it was realised that it was an excellent instrument for playing music from the Baroque and Classical music periods and it had a big influence on the way that other organs were built. 

Downes was Professor of Organ at the Royal College of Music from 1954 to 1975 and was the best known British organ teacher of his day. His students included Gillian Weir and Trevor Pinnock. He made many recordings and wrote a book about organ design.

He was given the honour of CBE in 1969. He died in London in 1993. There was no organ music at his funeral. Instead, he had asked for Gregorian chant to be sung.

William Morris (24 March 1834 - 3 October 1896) was an English architect, furniture and fabric designer, artist, writer, and socialist. He was born in Walthamstow in East London.

Morris was educated at Marlborough and Exeter College, Oxford. In 1856, he became an to Gothic revival architect G. E. Street. That year he founded the "Oxford and Cambridge Magazine". In 1861, Morris founded a design firm in partnership with the artist Edward Burne-Jones, and the poet and artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti. This had a great impact on the decoration of churches and houses in the early 20th century. Morris's major contribution was as a designer of repeating patterns for wallpapers and textiles. This was mainly based on a close observation of nature. He was also a major contributor to the resurgence of traditional textile arts and methods of production.

Morris wrote and published poetry, fiction, and translations of ancient and medieval texts throughout his life. His best-known works include "The Defence of Guenevere and Other Poems" (1858), "The Earthly Paradise" (1868–1870), "A Dream of John Ball" and the nothing.

William Morris designed his own furniture. He was frustrated because he could not find any furniture he liked, so he decided he wanted to design his own furniture. It was mostly wallpaper designs.

Morris was an important person in the emergence of socialism in Great Britain. He founded the Socialist League in 1884. However, he broke with the movement over goals and methods by the end of that decade. He devoted much of the rest of his life to the Kelmscott Press, which he founded in 1891. The 1896 Kelmscott edition of the "Works of Geoffrey Chaucer" is considered a masterpiece of book design.

Répétiteur

A Répétiteur is a musician who helps opera singers to learn their parts for an opera.

The word "Répétiteur" is a French word which comes from the verb "répéter" meaning: "to repeat". The meaning here is "to rehearse", because when a musician rehearses (practises) he will go over the music many times until he has learned it really well. The German word is Korrepetitor.

A répétiteur will be a very skilled musician. He will be an excellent pianist who can play music on the piano which is normally played by an orchestra. He will often be able to help the singer to get to know the music by singing another part that is going on at the same time. He will be able to help the singer with technical problems with their voice, and also with pronunciation and musical interpretation.

Some répétiteurs may go on to become famous conductors, e.g. Josef Krips and Howard Goodall.
In ballet, a répétiteur teaches the steps and interpretation of the roles to some or all of the company performing a dance.

Sparkling wine

Sparkling wine is the name for a number of wines which have a lot of carbon dioxide in them. This will make the wine fizzy. The carbon dioxide may be the result of the fermentation process, or it may have been added later. One of the best-known examples is probably Champagne, but there are many other such wines. In Spain such wines are called "Cava", in Italy "Asti" or "Spumante" and in German "Sekt". In French the terms "Mousseux" or "Crémant" are used for such wines, as well, especially for those which are not produced in the Champagne. Crémant d'Alsace, Blanquette de Limoux and Clairette de Die are examples of sparkling wines made in France outside the Champagne region. 

Most sparkling wines are made from white wine or rosé.

Clairette de Die

Clairette de Die is a kind of sweet white sparkling wine made from the Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains (75% minimum) and Clairette (25% maximum) grape varieties. It is produced in the Drôme department of France, in a part of the Rhône valley near the town of Die (pronounced "Dee"). The vineyards are some of the highest in France, between 400 and 700 metres above sea level. The region has a very long history of wine-growing, going back to Roman times.

The wine is bottle fermented. The muscat grapes which ripen first are kept separate from the clairette grapes. The grape juice is kept a low temperature, about 7°C, which means the fermentation will be slow and takes time. After filtering, but leaving some yeast the juice is blended in the bottle. It must be fermented in the bottle for at least another four months. The wine is then filtered again and put into new bottles for sale.

Blanquette de Limoux

Blanquette de Limoux is the name given to a number of sparkling wines from the Languedoc, in France. It is probably the oldest known sparkling wine in France. According to a text at a local abbey, Livy praised the wines from Limoux, which weren't sparkling wines, at the time. Benedictine monks of the abbey of Saint Hilaire found out how to make sparkling wine from white wine. Dom Pérignon brought back the method of making sparkling wines to his abbey in Champagne, at the end of the 16th century. He started to experiment with it in the vineyards of the abbey.

It is evident that neometaphsycis requires to function in an infinitely dimensioned medium. Therefore it can contact any thing or 'fact', no matter what its nature. 
Such principles available in a totally 'fluid' mode are fundamental or 'absolute' laws and manifest in every department which humanity may explore.
The use of such principles or fundamental laws give accurate, functioning knowledge of ANY matter. A 'fundamental' law is one that can be found in every area of exploring. The probability or truth of such a law depends on its frequency of existence: vid. maths of probability.

To make short reports of any action or place, we set the basic unit as one 'fact'. A 'fact' is "anything that can be known," and therefore must have 'reality' (being). Any group of such facts can now be known from any view point.

Facts will occupy a" series of levels", governed by their dimensionality. Facts of a given dimensionality will enclose lesser facts and in turn be enclosed by higher facts.Refer to enclosure. Optimum linkage and action between facts will occur when the dimensionality of all are within close limits - i.e. within each others band width.

Albert Goldfield

The Albert Goldfield is an area of 1300 square kilometres (500 square miles) where gold was discovered in the outback of New South Wales in 1880. Gold was found at Mount Browne, which is south west of Tibooburra. There were other finds at Good Friday, Easter Monday, Nuggerty, Pioneer Reef and Warratta Creek. 

This is a very hot and dry area of Australia. Because of the shortage of water, towns were started at Milparinka and Tibooburra where there was water available. Towns at Albert and Mount Browne did not last for long because of the lack of water. By 1881 there were more than 2000 people living on the gold diggings or in the towns. Geologist William Henry John Slee was appointed resident Goldfield Warden. The miners had to either take their dirt to one of the towns to use water to pan for the gold, or use a method called dry blowing. Dry blowing means breaking the dirt into fine particles and letting the wind blow away the dirt leaving the heavier gold behind. Life on the goldfields was hard, water was scarce, fresh fruit and vegetables were not available, and basics like flour were very expensive. Disease, including dysentery and typhoid were common.

By 1893 the gold rush had ended and most people had left the goldfields.

Irrigation sprinkler

Sprinkler irrigation is a way of artificially watering plants. A sprinkler irrigation system is a pressurized system, which means it needs water under pressure to work.

The system is made of a pump to take water and create pressure, and a network of pipes leading to the sprinkler head, which spreads water over the plants. Usually the sprinkler head is erected upward on a riser, which is a small pipe (about half a inch in diameter and one meter high). The sprinkler head is a simple-designed device composed of a hammer and a spring, both operates together to cut the water stream outgoing from the nozzle into small bits of water. These are spread over a circle of plants called the diameter of coverage.

Skagit River

The Skagit River is a river in Canada and the United States. It flows about from British Columbia to the state of Washington, where it flows into the Pacific Ocean north of Seattle. The river begins by flowing south. It then enters North Cascades National Park, where it is dammed by Ross Dam, which forms Ross Lake, a reservoir. The river then leaves the lake and flows into Diablo Lake, also a reservoir. It then keeps flowing southwest through a deep river canyon, known as the Skagit Gorge. It then meets its largest tributary, the Sauk River, and then turns west. (The Sauk is about 45 miles long, flowing northwest.) After turing west, the Skagit parallels the North Cascades Highway, leaving the national park. It meets another tributary, the Baker River, from the north. (The Baker flows south about 30 miles and is dammed twice, in Baker Lake and Lake Shannon.) The river then flows out to the sea near Mount Vernon, Washington. The total extent of the basin is 1,505 square miles (3,900 square kilometers).

The Green River is a river in the states of Wyoming and Utah, in the United States. It is the largest tributary of the Colorado River, at about 730 miles (1,175 km) long. Its headwaters are in the west part of Wyoming, in a subrange of the Rocky Mountains known as the Wind River Range. From there, it flows south, then turns east for a short while, then flows south, west, and south into the Reservoir, formed by Fontenelle Dam, and Flaming Gorge Reservoir, which is formed by the Flaming Gorge Dam. 

After it exits the dam, it flows east around the Uinta Mountains, and enters the desert-like Colorado Plateau. Here, it flows in a series of deep and spectacular canyons. It meets both of its largest tributaries, the White River and the Yampa River, from the east. In Canyonlands National Monument, it meets the Colorado. Shortly after the two rivers meet, they flow into Lake Powell, formed by Glen Canyon Dam.

Mono Lake is a saline lake on the east side of the Sierra Nevada, in the U.S. state of California. It is endorheic, meaning that it does not connect with the sea. It is fed by streams flowing off the east side of the mountain range, including Rush Creek, Lee Vining Creek and Mill Creek. Lee Vining Creek has its headwaters near Tioga Pass, near Yosemite National Park. 

The lake covers 69 square miles (180 square kilometers) and is about long. It is a very ancient lake, and is thought to have formed 760,000 years ago. In the 20th century, the city of Los Angeles began to take water from the streams feeding Mono Lake. This caused the lake to fall, exposing unique tufa formations.

Zhu Xi

Zhu Xi or Chu Hsi (朱熹, October 18, 1130 – April 23, 1200) was a Confucian scholar during the Song Dynasty. He was from Fujian province in China.

Zhu Xi was born Wu Yuan, North East Jiangxi province. He taught for many years in the Wuyi Mountains and he is also remembered for the large role he played he spent teaching at the Yuelu Academy in Changsha and at his retreat near the White Deer Grotto in Lushan. In his life his ideas were not generally accepted and he was fired from quite a lot of official positions. After his death nearly 1000 people were at his funeral and his tablet was put in a Confucian temple.
During the Song Dynasty, Zhu Xi's teachings were considered to be unorthodox. Rather than focusing on the "Book of Changes" like other Neo-Confucians, he chose to emphasize the Four Books: the "Great Learning", the "Doctrine of the Mean", the "Analects of Confucius", and the "Mencius" as the core curriculum (thing to learn) for aspiring scholar officials. For all these classics he wrote extensive commentaries (big reviews) that were not widely recognized in his time; however, they later became accepted as their standard commentaries. The Four Books served as the basis of civil service examinations all the way down to 1905.

According to Zhu Xi, knowledge and action were indivisible components of truly intelligent activity. Although he did distinguish (tell apart) between the priority of knowing, since intelligent action requires forethought (thought before), and the importance of action, as it produces a discernible effect, Zhu Xi said "Knowledge and action always require each other. It is like a person who cannot walk without legs although he has eyes, and who cannot see without eyes although he has legs. With respect to order, knowledge comes first, and with respect to importance, action is more important."

Vale of Glamorgan Railway

The Vale of Glamorgan Railway Company are a Welsh railway preservation society originally called the Butetown Historic Railway Society.

In 1979, the Butetown Historic Railway Society was formed at Bute Road Station in the docklands are of Cardiff. The aim was to restore the then derelict Taff Vale Railway station, and establish a steam hauled passenger service to Cardiff Queen Street station. By 1994, a short section of track existed, and the steam locomotive "Sir Gomer" hauled short passenger trains.

By 1997, the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was in charge of the redevelopment of Butetown, and dismissed the idea of a rejuvenated steam railway as part of their plans.

Even prior to 1997 the railway started negotiations with the Vale of Glamorgan Council and moved in during 1998 to its new base at Barry Island Railway. It renamed it self the Vale of Glamorgan Railway Company and were based there till early 2009 operating heritage services both steam and diesel over an expanding network of lines.

Following the December 2007 decision by landlords, the Vale of Glamorgan Council to terminate the £65,000 funding of the Barry Island Railway, the society maintain a service. However less than six months after withdrawing financial support, the council with out warning decided to put the railway site out to tender under a long term lease. There were three bids submitted with the sucsefull bidder being the commercial company Cambrian Transport who have been the councils railway adviser and contractor since the the Barry Railway Project started.

The other bidder NEWCO was submitted by Graham Lee owner of the LH Plant, Hunselt Engine Company, Statfold Barn Railway and Mike Thomson owner of Arrowvale who make black boxes for the rail industry. NEWCO had spoken to the VGR in advance and agree a method of working together. Had this bid been successfully the VGR would have continued operating at Barry.

The Railway has recently sold assets following the break down of talks with Cambrian Transport which an has been forced to leave Barry. It is now the intention for the railway to relocate to the Bridgend Valleys Railway, with some stock also going to the Dean Forest Railway and further a field.

The Railway is now working with the Bridgend Valleys Railway to develop the 4.5 miles of line in place north of Bridgend.

Epping Ongar Railway

The Epping Ongar Railway is a preserved railway. It runs along the last section of the old Great Eastern Railway and London Underground Central line branch line. The line runs between Epping and Ongar. There is also an intermediate stop at North Weald. The line was reopened in late 2004 after 10 years of being closed. It runs a Sunday and Bank Holiday service using a Class 117 diesel multiple unit. The service runs between Ongar and Coopersale. The service is provided by volunteers who take care for the line as well as run the trains. The land and infrastructure are owned by Epping Ongar Railway Ltd.

The branch line to Ongar was built in 1865 by the Eastern Counties/Great Eastern Railway. The eastern section of the line, between Epping and Ongar, was single track. There was one passing loop at North Weald station. Around 14 trains went as far as Ongar station each day. The rest finished at Epping or Loughton.

The trains continued to finish at Epping or Loughton until 1949. At this time the London Passenger Transport Board's New Works project extended the Central line to Epping using electric trains. The Central Line would take over the railway from British Rail. As part of this change, the Epping-Ongar branch line had its through trains to London removed. Instead, a shuttle service between Epping (to connect with trains to London) and Ongar was used. At one stage, it was possible to see the unusual sight of steam trains and London Underground electric multiple units side-by-side at Epping. The steam shuttle was hired by the London Transport Executive from British Rail. This was because it was felt that the cost of electrifying the line to Ongar could not be justified because of the low passenger numbers on this part of the branch.
In the 1950s, there were attempts to improve the service on the branch line. Over time, permission was given to electrify the line in 1957. However, because the electrification did not cost much, the branch was only able to have special two- or three-car trains running on it. This was because the power supply was not strong enough to support trains that had more cars. Another problem was that the stations on the line had short platforms. This would mean that the normal 8-car trains would not be able to stop at them. Because of this, the Epping-Ongar branch line was normally operated separately from the rest of the Central Line. However, for two days each year, trains did run through from London. These trains would terminate at North Weald for the airshow on the Saturday and Sunday of its opening. The normal Epping-Ongar service would get around this extra service by passing the train on the other line at North Weald station whilst it headed towards Epping. The train from London was run as an extra train on the normal Central Line timetable. However, this extra train was only four carriages long instead of the normal eight.

During the late 1960s it became clear that the amount of people using the line had not become as big as people thought that it would. Not a lot of new development was allowed because the land was now Green Belt land. The amount of people using the line peaked in 1971, and it was still only 650 people every day. This meant that the line did not make very much money. London Underground tried to close the whole line in 1980, but they were not able to. Instead, fewer trains were run on the line and they also closed Blake Hall tube station on Sundays.

Blake Hall was permanently closed in 1981. Before the station closed it only had six passengers a day. The station building still survives as a private residence. However, the platform has been removed.

North Weald station's platform one was closed in 1976. The passing loop and westbound tracks were lifted in 1978. Until this time, access to the two platforms was controlled from the original Eastern Counties Railway signal box. This signal box is still on the southbound platform. North Weald was the last section of the London Underground network to be signalled using semaphore signals.

The line was making a loss of seven pounds for each passenger journey. It was also in need of some expensive maintenance work. On 30 September 1994, the line was closed to the public. From this time on, the Central Line terminated at Epping station. When the line closed it was carrying just 80 passengers a day. Local lore said that the line was being kept open in case the Cabinet needed to be evacuated to the nuclear bunker at Doddinghurst.

Cravens Heritage Trains have preserved a three-car unit of 1960 stock. This was the train that ran the final London Underground service on the line.

The line was bought by Pilot Developments in 1998. Pilot Developments is now known as Epping Ongar Railway Ltd. The Ongar Railway Preservation Society also entered an offer to buy the line. Their offer was for £325,000. However, Pilot Developments made a slightly higher offer and got London Underground to accept it. Martin Bell, an independent politician, said that this was "the most controversial land deal in the constituency for years". He said that there was a conflict of interest with local politicians.

The line reopened on Sunday 10 October 2004. It is being run by the Epping Ongar Railway Volunteer Society. An hourly service between Ongar and North Weald was operated. Shortly after opening the line was extended to Coopersale. However, it is currently not possible to get off the train there.

Between 22 January and 9 April 2006 the line was closed for engineering works. The works included general station maintenance, rolling stock maintenance and track maintenance. Ongar station remained closed for engineering works and general maintenance and reopened on Sunday 28 May 2006 to passengers. At first though it was not possible to use the station buildings.

At the end of 2007, the railway was sold to a new private owner. This was because planning permission for the Ongar residential development had been given. The new owner wants to bring steam locomotives back to the line.

In early 2008, the line was closed to passenger trains. This was to allow the railway to be able to have major engineering works. The work will mean that steam locomotives will be able to run on the line again. To make this happen run-round loops and signalling, amongst other things, must be built.

Passenger services on the heritage line were operated throughout 2006 and 2007 by a Class 117 diesel multiple unit. This unit is currently being restored along with a class 205 DEMU. Class 37029 is in operation along with 03170. There are a selection of British rail Mk1 and Mk2 coaches on the line. The line also has some small diesel shunters; a Drewry shunter (works number 2566, current number D1995), named "Heather" by the railway, and two Ruston 88 shunters (RH 512572 is in service, RH 398616 is being used for spares and as a static display). The line employs a Harsco tug unit ("Badger") for engineering work. The EOR's fleet also includes a small works trolley, a Shark brake van, a Dogfish ballast hopper, and a box van for permanent way duties. 

At one point the line owned two trains of 1962 tube stock. Units 1616 and 1491 (formed as an eight-car train) were purchased in 1996, and unit 1744 was purchased in 1998. These units were taken away to be cut up for scrap in 1998 and 2003, respectively, after they were destroyed by vandals.

The Ecclesbourne Valley Railway is a heritage railway in Derbyshire. Its operations are based at Wirksworth station. It is currently planned to extend the railway along the former Midland Railway branch line which joined the main-line at Duffield. 

When complete it will be one of the few Heritage Railways that operates a whole branch line in its original form and entire length.

The line is operated by diesel locomotives, which haul former multiple unit trailer cars and also uses heritage diesel multiple units.

The "Wirksworth Branch" was the product of early nineteenth century railway rivalry. Since 1835 Wirksworth's citizens had been promoting the idea for a branch line from the North Midland Railway (later the Midland Railway) at Duffield. The Midland was initially uninterested, but then realised that the branch could be extended to Rowsley. This was difficult, but the branch could avoid the section from Ambergate, on its Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway, which was shared with its rival the London and North Western Railway.

Chelsea–Hackney line

The Chelsea-Hackney (or "Chelney") line is a safeguarded route for an underground railway running from south-west London to north-east London. As of 2008, the plan is being developed by Cross London Rail Links Ltd. who are the developers of Crossrail . It is therefore sometimes known as Crossrail 2.

Naval mine

A naval mine is a bomb placed in water to destroy ships or submarines. Unlike depth charges, mines are put in the water and left to wait until they make contact with a ship. Naval mines can be used offensively, to make it harder for enemy ships to sail easily, or trap them into a harbour. They can also be used defensively, to protect friendly ships and create "safe" zones.

Mines can be laid in many ways: by specially built minelayers, refitted ships, submarines, aircraft, or even by dropping them into a harbour by hand. They are a cheap weapon with a basic mine costing as little as US$1000. There are very advanced mines which can cost millions and have several kinds of sensors, and deliver a warhead by rocket or torpedo.

International law says that nations have to say when they put mines in an area. This is to make it easier for civil shipping to avoid the mines. The warnings do not have to be specific; during World War II, Britain said simply that it had mined the English Channel, North Sea, and French coast.

Neil Finn

Neil Finn (born May 27 1958) is a rock singer. He was born in New Zealand. Together with his brother Tim, he was the lead singer for Split Enz. He is the frontman of Crowded House. He has released solo albums. He has created the 7 Worlds Collide project and the Pajama Club band.

In the late 1970s he replaced singer songwriter Phil Judd in Split Enz. Split Enz was his brother Tim's band. Neil went on to write some of the biggest hits for the band. Examples are "One Step Ahead", "History Never Repeats", "I Got You" and "Message to My Girl". Split Enz broke up in 1984. 

After that, Neil formed Crowded House with Split Enz's final drummer Paul Hester and bass player Nick Seymour in 1985. They became famous worldwide in 1987 when they released the single "Don't Dream It's Over". He ended Crowded House in 1996 to start a solo career. 

Neil Finn has recorded two solo albums to date: "Try Whistling This" (1998) and "One Nil" (2001). ("One Nil" was released in the US and Canada — remixed, reordered and renamed "One All" — in 2002.) He has also worked together with his brother Tim on two Finn Brothers albums, "Finn" (1995) and "Everyone Is Here (2004)."

In 2001, he released a live album/DVD ("7 Worlds Collide") with songs that were recorded at St James Theatre in Auckland, New Zealand. Other musicians that were on stage with him were Lisa Germano, Sebastian Steinberg (Soul Coughing), Ed O'Brien and Phil Selway (Radiohead), Johnny Marr (The Smiths), Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam), Paul Jeffrey, Tim Finn, and Betchadupa. 

In 2009, another album was released under the "7 Worlds Collide" name. This was "The Sun Came Out". It was a charity studio record for Oxfam. This album has songs by Jeff Tweedy and three other members of Wilco, Scottish singer-songwriter KT Tunstall, and New Zealand songwriters Don McGlashan and Bic Runga.

Finn has contributed solo music to various film and TV soundtracks including "Rain", "Boston Legal", "Boston Public", "The Waiting Game", "Antz", and "Sports Night".

In 2007, Finn reformed Crowded House with Beck's former drummer Matt Sherrod. They released two albums "Time on Earth" (2007) and "Intriguer" (2010). 

In 2011, he has formed Pajama Club with his wife Sharon, New Zealand indie artist SJD and Alana Skyring.

Finn married Sharon Dawn Johnson, on 13 February 1982. The song "I Love You Dawn", available on "Afterglow" was written in her honour. Sharon makes chandeliers in her workshop in Auckland. She has appeared on backing vocals on various albums such as "Crowded House" and Alex Lloyd's "Watching Angels Mend" She also features prominently on the second 7 Worlds Collide project, co-writing (and sharing lead vocal) the track 'Little By Little' with her husband and sings on the track 'Isolation' on the new Crowded House album, Intriguer. In 2011, she becomes part of the "Pajama Club" band after a jam session with Neil.

They have two sons, Liam Mullane Finn (born 1983) and Elroy Timothy Finn (born 1989). Both sons have performed alongside their father. Liam had his own band, Betchadupa, originally based in Auckland, then London before releasing a solo album, "I'll Be Lightning" in 2008. He also plays in Crowded House's touring band lineup. Elroy Finn is drummer for the psychobilly band The Tricks and has been filling in on drums for Cut Off Your Hands.

Francisco Correa de Arauxo

Francisco Correa de Arauxo (or Araujo) (b. Seville, 1584; d. Segovia, 1654) was an important Spanish organist, composer, and theorist in the last years of the Renaissance and early years of the Baroque period.

We do not know very much about Correa de Araujo. He was probably born in 1584. He may have been of Portugese origin. In 1599 he got a job as organist in Seville. It must have been an important job because he earned a lot of money. Many years later he seems to have become a priest. He may have been made a priest because he was a good organist. In 1630 he organized a protest when priests were made to work harder wothout being paid more money. Because he argued about this he was sent to prison for a time. By 1635 his health was very bad. In spite of earning a high salary he often had no money. 

After 37 years in Seville he took a job as organist in Jaén Cathedral. He was there until 1640 when he went to Segovia Cathedral. He worked there until 1653, by which time he was too ill to work. When he died the following year he was very poor.

Correa only seems to have published one collection of organ works. It was called "Libro de tientos y discursos de música practica, y theorica de organo intitulado Facultad organica" (1626). This was a collection of organ music, as well as a discussion about music theory. It is one of the few books we have which shows us what musical composition was like in Spain at that time. His organ music uses a divided keyboard (medio registro), so that the upper and lower parts of the keyboard (high notes and low notes) can use different stops (making different sounds). The organ pieces in the collection are arranged in order of difficulty. The pieces at the end are very hard indeed. He uses a lot of dissonances, and he expects the performer to put in lots of ornaments, even if they are not shown in the music. He uses glosa (ornamental figuration), although he also uses counterpoint. His harmony shows the influence of composers such as Cabezon and Aguilera de Heredia.

Creative network

A creative network is a loose group of people creating something in art or science or business. It is never larger than about a dozen people who may move from one project to another as a troupe or team. 

They have only a few goals at a time, and never more than one major goal. Each person plays a tightly or loosely defined role in the network. For instance to make a movie a writer, director, producer and actors are needed. There may also be a need for a costumer, a cameraman (if the director cannot do it all), an audio engineer, and a film editor if the project is big enough and the schedule tight enough. Very often the roles and timing are determined by a power network (say the bank or studio that funds the project). However, the creative control remains within the small creative network.

Apollo 14

Apollo 14 was the eighth manned mission in the Apollo program. It was the third mission to land on the Moon. The nine-day mission left the Earth on January 31, 1971, and landed on the Moon on February 5. The Lunar Module landed in the Fra Mauro formation; this had been the target of the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission. During the two walks on the Moon's surface, of moon rock was collected. Several experiments, including seismic studies, were carried out. Commander Alan Shepard famously hit two golf balls on the lunar surface with a make-shift club he had brought from Earth. Command Module Pilot Stuart Roosa took several hundred seeds on the mission, many of which were planted on return, resulting in the so called Moon trees. The pilot of the Lunar Module was Dr. Edgar Mitchell.

In June 2009, the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter was able to photograph the Apollo 14 landing site. The base of the lunar module and the astronauts footprints on the Moon's suface could be clearly seen.

Plantain

The plantain is a crop from the genus Musa. Its fruits are edible, and are generally used for cooking. This is different from the soft and sweet banana (which is often called "dessert banana"). What is exported to countries like the European Union or the United States is the "dessert banana", and not the plantain. 

The way certain species are called often show how they are used: "cooking plantain", "banana plantain", "beer banana", "bocadillo plantain" (the little one), etc. All members of the genus "Musa" are indigenous to the tropical region of Southeast Asia, including the Malay Archipelago and northern Australia.

Plantains are often firmer than dessert bananas; they also have less sugar. Dessert bananas are often eaten raw; plantains are usually cooked or otherwise processed before they are eaten. Plantains are a staple food in tropical regions, treated similarly to potatoes. They also have a similar taste. 

Regions with Plantain crops include the Southern United States, the Caribbean, Central America, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Southern Brazil, the Canary Islands, Madeira, Egypt, Cameroon, Nigeria, Uganda, Okinawa, and Taiwan. Farmers grow plantains as far north as Northern California and as far south as KwaZulu-Natal.
Each pseudostem of a plantain plant will flower only once. All the flowers grow at the end of its shoot in a large bunch made of multiple "hands" with individual "fingers" (the fruits). Only the first few hands will become fruits. In Vietnam the young male flower, at the end of the bunch, is used to make salad. 
In Laos, the plantain flower is often eaten raw; it is added to a special kind of soup. Thoran is made in Kerala with the end of the bunch (called "Koompu" in Malayalam). It is said to be very healthy.

Plantain leaves are used like plates in several dishes, including Hallaca from Venezuela, or south Indian Thali. In southern India, meals are traditionally served on a plantain leaf. The position of the different food items on the leaf is important, also for Hindu rituals. 

The plantain leaves often add an aroma to the dish. In the Indian state of Kerala, a food preparation called "Ada" is made in plantain leaves. Plantain leaves are also used in making "Karimeen Pollichathu" in Kerala. 

The leaves are usually easy to find in Venezuela. They are sold at grocery] stores, and they can be bought on the open-air markets there . Leaves can be very big, over in length. They are also used to simulate appetite, as they have a distinctive smell when hot food is placed on them. 

In Nicaragua, leaves are used to wrap different kinds of food, such as Nacatamales,Vigoron and Vaho. In Peru they are often used to wrap the famous Tamale (Tamales). In Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia, these are usually used to wrap tamales before and while cooking, and they can be used to wrap any kind of seasoned meat while cooking to keep the flavor in. The plantain is the main food source of the Dominican Republic, and is used just as much as, if not more than, rice. Mangu and Sancocho are two dishes for which the plantain is very important. 

The leaves are also dried and used to wrap corn dough before it is boiled to make Fanti kenkey, a fine Ghanaian dish eaten with ground pepper, onions, tomatoes and fish.

The plantain will only fruit once. After harvesting the fruit, the plantain plant can be cut and the layers peeled (like an onion) to get a cylinder shaped soft shoot. This can be chopped and first steamed, then fried with masala powder, to make an excellent dish. This dish is called "Posola" in Assamese and a distinct part of Assamese cuisine. In Kerala a thoran is made out of the shoot.

<doc id="191533" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=191533" title="Braidwood, New South Wales">
Braidwood, New South Wales

Braidwood () is a town in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. It is in the Palerang Shire. In 2006 there were 1,108 people living in Braidwood. It was used as a location for the movie Ned Kelly starring Mick Jagger in 1969.

Braidwood is on the Kings Highway which joins Canberra to Batemans Bay on the coast. It is about south west of Sydney. It is in a highland area near the headwaters of the Shoalhaven River.

European explorers, Kearns, Marsh and Packer, reached the area in 1822 and the settlers arrived soon after. The town was surveyed in 1839. Gold was discovered in 1851, and over the next 20 years the population grew to about 10,000.

The town was named after Dr Thomas Braidwood Wilson. He had been a surgeon on the ships taking convicts to New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land (now known as Tasmania). He was first given land in Van Diemen's Land in 1824, but changed it for land near Lake George in 1825. He was also given of land in the 'new country' on Monkittee and Flood creeks. In 1833 the government took back the western end of Wilson's land for a future village. They gave him more land at the eastern land in return. Wilson moved to the district in late 1836 with his wife and family. He became a community leader. He built the first courthouse in 1837-38. In 1840 Wilson asked the government to build a road from Braidwood to Huskisson for faster and cheaper shipping of wool to Sydney. Wilson and Col. John Mackenzie, supplied the materials and men to make the Braidwood to Nerriga section. In 1841 there were 141 people living at Braidwood Farm. Wilson lost all of his money because of a drought in the late 1830s. He died in November 1843. His land was sold for £2,000 to John Coghill, who now owned most of the land on the south, east and north of the town. Wilson still owned land on a hill north of the town and was buried there in 1843.

A memorial and large pine tree mark the site of Wilson's grave. The path to the grave is open to the public and is through a series of paddocks with gateway sculptures and large art pieces by local artists.

Bushrangers, Thomas and John Clarke, killed four policemen near Braidwood in 1867. There is a special monument for the police in the Braidwood cemetery.

Australia's first Royal Commission took place in Braidwood in 1867. It looked at the role of the police in trying to control bushrangers in the area. The Commission found the police were lazy, and in some cases had actually helped the bushrangers. They found that the superintendent of police did not have 'strict and proper control over his men.'

Because of the goldrush the banks and hotels in Braidwood were well built and made to last. It is these old heritage buildings that now attract visitors to the town. Other businesses in the area are sheep and cattle farming, and timber growing.

Braidwood used to be the home of the Tallaganda local government area. However, following changes to local government areas by the New South Wales Government, it is now part of the Palerang council. The eastern office of the council is in the town. The local paper is now called the "Braidwood Times".

After the gold rush, Braidwood became a quiet and poor country town. Because of this, very little new building work was carried out, and so the town still has most of its original streetscape and architecture intact. On 30 March 2006 the town and its setting were listed on the NSW State Heritage Register. There were arguments between those who wanted to save the town's old fashioned charm and those wishing to develop it.

The town has several times been used for movie making locations:

Local stories say that Mick Jagger wrote one of his major hits while in Braidwood making Ned Kelly; but there is no agreement as to which one.

2009 Formula One season

The 2009 Formula One season was the 60th FIA Formula One World Championship season. There were ten teams signed up to compete in the championship. Jenson Button became the Drivers' World Champion and Brawn GP won the Constructors' title.

The season is scheduled to take place over 17 rounds, and started with the Australian Grand Prix on 29 March 2009. It will end on 1 November 2009 with the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, which is included on the race calendar for the first time and will be held at the new Yas Marina Circuit. The French and Canadian Grands Prix, which were both included in the 2008 championship, have been dropped.

Several rule changes will be implemented by the FIA, in a bid to cut costs due to the global financial crisis and to improve the on-track spectacle. New rules governing tyres, aerodynamics and Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS), among others, are some of the biggest changes in the Formula One regulations for several decades. FIA initially declared a change in deciding the World Driver's Championship, with the driver winning the most races to be declared as the champion. However, this decision was later reversed following protests from Formula One Teams Association.

 Drivers did not finish the Grand Prix, but were classified as they completed over 90% of the race distance.

Ned Kelly (1970 movie)

Ned Kelly is the name of a 1970 film. It was the second Australian feature length movie about Australian bushranger Ned Kelly. The first was "The Story of the Kelly Gang" made in 1906, the world's first feature film.

"Ned Kelly" was directed by Tony Richardson, and starred Mick Jagger as Ned Kelly. Scottish-born actor Mark McManus played the part of Kelly's friend Joe Byrne. It was a British production, but was filmed entirely in Australia, shot mostly around Braidwood in southern New South Wales, with mainly Australian actors.

There were many problems in getting the movie made. The actors' union, Actors' Equity and some of Ned Kelly's relatives protested strongly about Jagger having the lead role. Many people were upset that the film would be made in country NSW, not Victoria, where the Kellys had lived.

Jagger's girlfriend, Marianne Faithfull, had come to Australia to play the lead female role of Ned's sister, Maggie. Their relationship was breaking up, and she took an overdose of sleeping tablets soon after she got to Sydney. She was in a coma, but soon got better and went back to England. She was replaced by an unknown Australian actress, Diane Craig. During filming, Jagger was hurt by a pistol misfiring. The actors and crew were often sick, some costumes were destroyed by fire, and Jagger's co-star, Mark McManus, just escaped serious injury when a horse-drawn cart in which he was riding overturned during filming.

The body armour costume worn by Jagger is on show at the Queanbeyan City Library, with the letters "MJ" scratched on the inside. The head-piece has been stolen, the loss of an important piece of Australian film history.

The film was very poorly received at its opening, and is still said to be Richardson's worst film. Neither Richardson or Jagger went to the London opening of the film.

The movie has music written by Shel Silverstein, and performed by Kris Kristofferson and Waylon Jennings, with one song by Jagger.

Spring Offensive

The 1918 Spring Offensive or Kaiserschlacht ("Kaiser's Battle"), also known as the Ludendorff Offensive, was a series of German attacks along the Western Front during World War I, which marked the deepest advances by either side since 1914. The German authorities had realised that their only remaining chance of victory was to defeat the Allies before the overwhelming human and matériel resources of the United States could be deployed. They also had the advantage of nearly 50 divisions freed by the Russian surrender (Treaty of Brest-Litovsk).

<doc id="191585" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=191585" title="Letter of Jeremiah">
Letter of Jeremiah

The Letter of Jeremiah, also known as the Epistle of Jeremy. This is a deuterocanonical (or apocryphal) book of the Old Testament. The letter is believed to have been made by Jeremiah to the people who were to be taken prisoner into Babylon. It is included in Catholic Bibles as the last part of the Book of Baruch. It is also in Orthodox Bibles as a standalone book.

Most learned people argue that the person who started the book was not Jeremiah. Jeremiah was a Hellenistic Jew who lived in Alexandria. Whoever the starter, the work was written with a purpose: to teach the Jews not to worship the gods of the Babylonians. Instead, to worship only the Lord.

The letter (epistle) is part of the Septuagint. There is no evidence of it ever having been rule bearing in the Jewish tradition.

The earliest evidence we have of the question of its canonicity arising in Christian tradition is in the work of Origen of Alexandria, as reported by Eusebius in his Church History. Origen listed Lamentations and the Letter of Jeremiah as one unit with the Book of Jeremiah proper, among "the canonical books as the Hebrews have handed them down". 

Jerome provided the majority of the translation work for the vulgar (popular) Latin translation of the Bible, called the Vulgate Bible. In view of the fact that no Hebrew text was available, Jerome refused to consider the Epistle of Jeremiah, as the other books he called apocryphal, canonical.

Despite Jerome's reservations, the epistle is included as chapter 6 of the book of Baruch in the Old Testament of the Vulgate. The Authorized King James Version follows the same practice, while placing Baruch in the Apocrypha section. In the Ethiopian Orthodox canon, it forms part of the "Rest of Jeremiah", along with 4 Baruch (also known as the "Paraleipomena of Jeremiah").

The epistle is one of three deuterocanonical books found among the Dead Sea scrolls (see Tanakh at Qumran). (The other two are Ben Sira and Tobit.) The portion of the epistle discovered at Qumran was written in Greek. This does not preclude the possibility of the text being based on a prior Hebrew or Aramaic text. However, the only text available to us has dozens of linguistic features available in Greek, but not in Hebrew, hence introductions of a Greek editor, not required for minimalist translation.

Revelation is when something is made clear or obvious that was hidden before. Most of the time, the term is used to speak about religious revelations. That means that the revelation is done by communication with the divine. Revelation can be through a deity who may send a messenger.

Sebastián Aguilera de Heredia

Sebastian Aguilera de Heredia (born about 1565; died Saragossa, 16 December 1620) was a Spanish organist and composer.

We do not know much about his life. He described himself once as a "Saragossan priest", so he may have meant that he was born in Saragossa, or just that he worked there. In 1585 he became organist at Huesca Cathedral. In 1603 he became a priest and organist at the Cathedral of La Seo, Saragossa. He looked after the organ at the cathedral and often had work done to improve it. All his compositions were for the church: both his organ music and vocal music. His organ works show that he learned from composers such as Antonio de Cabezón, but he put new, modern ideas in his music which later influenced younger composers such as Correa de Arauxo.

A very important new technique which he used was the use of a divided keyboard (medio registro) which allowed different sounds in the upper half and the lower half of the keyboard (on today's organs one would need a two-manual organ to get the same effect). He wrote 36 settings of the Magnificat. His vocal work shows a skilful use of polyphony.

Lately, Simple has been needing oversight more and more. We have had perform oversight for us. After this, and discussion, Simple decided that it might not be a bad idea for the project to have local oversighters.

Elections for oversight will most likely be held sometime in early August. If you are over the age of 18 and an experienced admin, please sign up! We need your help. Hopefully, after the election we will have local oversighters and be able to deal with the need for such more efficiently.

A Papal conclave is a meeting of Cardinals. The cardinals meet to elect the next bishop of Rome, to become pope. This becomes necessary when the old pope dies or resigns. Usually, popes do not resign, though. The last pope to resign was Pope Gregory XII. 

The word "conclave" is from Latin. It refers to the fact that the cardinals are locked up together, until they have agreed on a new pope. Today, this happens in the Sistine Chapel.

Hunger

Hunger is the feeling of wanting to eat. The opposite of hunger is called "satiety" or "fullness". The feeling is started in the hypothalamus, and hormones are released from the liver. People who have eaten can survive weeks without eating, but they will start to feel hungry after they have not eaten for a few hours. Hunger is generally considered quite uncomfortable. People who have eaten food usually will feel less hungry, or not hungry at all. People can live longer without food than without water.
Hunger is also used to refer to people who generally have little to eat, and are therefore often hungry.

Chanakya (Sanskrit: चाणक्य "" tamil: சாணக்கியர்) (c. 350-283 BCE) was an adviser and a prime minister to Chandragupta Maurya (c. 340-293 BCE). Chanakya helped Chandragupta create the Maurya Empire. Chanakya is considered a pioneer (someone who explores a new area) in economics. He wrote about economics a very long time before Ibn Khaldun.

He is generally called Chanakya (taken from his father's name "Chanak") but, in his capacity as author of the "Arthaśhāstra", is generally referred to as Kautilya derived from his gotra's name "KOTIL"(Kautilya means "of Kotil"). He believed in four ways: Treating with Equality, Enticement, Punishment or War and Sowing Dissension. The "Arthaśhāstra" identifies its author by the name Kautilya, except for one verse which refers to him by the name Vishnugupta. One of the earliest Sanskrit literatures to explicitly identify Chanakya with Vishnugupta was Vishnu Sarma's "Panchatantra" in the 3rd century BC.

Junipers is the name for a number of species of coniferous plants in the genus "Juniperus". They are related to the family "Cupressaceae" (the cypress). There are between 50 and 67 species of juniper. Junipers grow in the northern hemisphere. 

Junipers are evergreen. They vary in size from low shrubs to tall trees, which grow to between twenty and forty metres tall. The female trees have seed cones which form something resembling a berry. These berries are called juniper berries. They take from six to eighteen months to grow, after pollination, are often aromatic and can be used as a spice.

The juniper berry is the female seed cone made by the different kinds of junipers. It is not a true berry, but its unusual fatness and scales make it like a berry. Some of the cones are used as spices. Juniper berries are also used to flavour gin. According to a FAO document, juniper berries are the only spice that comes from conifers. However, tar and bark from pine trees are sometimes thought of as spices, too.

Boeremusiek (Afrikaans: ‘Boer music’) is a kind of South African instrumental folk music. Its was made to go with social dancing at parties and festivals.

Boeremusiek is from Europe. It was brought to South Africa and changed into its own style. It is thought to have got to South Africa by British Empire military bands.

Every artist or band comes up with their own sound and style. They make up their own style by playing different types of concertinas and using different instruments in the band. 

A concertina is similar to an accordion and is the lead instrument in most Boeremusiek bands. There are many different types of concertinas, which is why Boeremusiek has so many sounds and styles, and the construction the concertina is what makes the different sounds in the Boeremusiek band; it depends on where the slots and holes are put makes the difference on the sound that the concertina makes. 

Other instruments that might be in a Boeremusiek band are piano accordions, button harmonicas, accordions, pianos, harmoniums and the guitar. Sometimes, a cello or bass guitar may be seen. 

Today, there are many successful Boeremusiek bands that have recorded albums. Some famous bands and individual artists today are Klipwerf Boereorkes, Danie Grey, Nico Carstens, Taffie Kikkilus, Brian Nieuwoudt, Samuel Petzer, Worsie Visser and Die Ghitaar Man.

Military Merit Cross (Austria–Hungary)

The Military Merit Cross (German: "Militärverdienstkreuz", Croatian: "Vojni križ za zasluge") was a decoration of the Empire of Austria and, after the establishment of the Dual Monarchy in 1867, the Empire of Austria-Hungary. It was first established on 22 October 1849 and underwent several revisions to its design and award criteria over the years of its existence. It became obsolete in 1918 with the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

Bing (before called "Windows Live Search" and "MSN Search") is a search engine website. Microsoft calls it a "decision engine", meaning that Bing tries to find meanings from search results and gives people links to websites listing the best links first.

On July 29, 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced that Bing would power Yahoo! Search. All Yahoo! Search global customers and partners will be shifted to Bing by early 2012.

In October 2011, Microsoft announced "Tiger", a new internal search computer program for Bing. When it is finished, Bing will deliver faster and more relevant search results for users. It is being incorporated into Bing around the world starting in August 2011.

Bing includes the listing of search suggestions as queries are entered. It lists related searches (called "Explore pane") based on semantic technology from Powerset that Microsoft purchased in 2008.

Hi guys! This is my 10th article for simple News (yes, really, we've had 10 editions!).

The other day I made an important decision. I was wondering whether I should stop editing wiki or get more active again. I chose the latter and I will concentrate on eradicating stubs. That's why I'm asking you once more to join and help me and others out. 

At SN we'd still like to write our story but we haven't had much feedback. Could you please say wether you accept or decline being part of it. 

How about helping out at or help us out with SN.

I am a strong believer in the usage of simpleWP for school projects, however, I have often found them to be confusing at times. For instance, last night (this morning) I was reviewing Recent changes when I noticed a school project () start their editing session. Fine, no problems so far, but I then noticed an anon editor making what I considered an unrelated change to one of the teacher's sub-pages, so I rolled it back. I did this because all changes within the school project had so far used logged in accounts and because the change seemed unrelated to the topic of the sub-page. I later TW reverted (AGF) my own edit and thought, nah, I'll AGF here and let it go. This, however, got me to thinking that school projects should register as such on a WP page somewhere and they should give us guidelines as to what we can expect and what we should accept as normal behaviour. We are not here to pander to the whims of a teacher as our main goal, but are here to grow a Simple English version of an encyclopedia for all users of Simple English to use and edit. So, I think we need a page (and updated ) where school projects would register with us so editors don't make (possible) mistakes like the one I "may" have made today. Comments? 06:01, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

Team: I have been wondering a couple of things. We often block users who are vandals, create attack pages etc., but they sometimes return and we just block them again, and again, and again, and again... My question is, when do we take it further; i.e.: report them to an ISP, to their school, to the police? Some people actually break laws when they edit here, such as the new criminal laws on cyber-bullying. Do we ever take it a step further, or do we only ever offer "empty threats"? For instance, take this edit (admins only!). This may be fake or it may be about an actual human being who is being attacked in a vicious manner. Do we always ignore these things? When do we report? Whom should we escalate it to, WMF, the ISP, the college? Just curious. 01:10, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

I think we just oversighted more edits in a couple hours than have been oversighted in a couple years... - () 18:09, 7 July 2009 (UTC)
As a side thought, with the increase of oversight, we may desire to local elect. () 20:36, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

This discussion is about what to do with persistent vandals and serious vandalism and personal attack editors. WP:ABUSE is a project at enWP that works to investigate serious abuse and inform the correct people about it; ie: informing an editors ISP, school, or other authority about abuse coming from anonymous editors via their systems. We should not be holding a yet, but simply discussing it. 

I can't think of a compelling reason "not" to have this team, and there have been a few cases where it would make sense. It doesn't need to be used often (I hope it's a relatively inactive project), but there are some repeat vandals here (like one who makes edits about movies made by a certain famous company...) that could be addressed in a joint way by knowledgeable admins and checkusers. Also, both in the UK and in the US (as well as many other countries), there are laws about what is acceptable on the internet. I think it's time our Wikipedia made sure that we are not allowing illegal activities on our project to continue unopposed. As I said before, I hope that we will rarely need to have investigations, but it would be nice (as an admin who notices a pattern of vandalism) to know that something more than year-long anon blocks can be done. 12:48, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

NB: "This discussion has moved to . Please continue the discussion there."

This discussion is about whether or not we should elect some local oversighters. These are trusted and identified (to WMF only) who can permanently delete edits of an attacking nature where the edits include personal information, libel or other serious acts that need to be removed even from administrator viewing. We should not be holding a yet, but simply discussing it. 


I think that support seems to be expressed above for there to be a proposal for local oversighters to exist. As such, I've made one on . Please express your opinions there from now on. Thanks! 06:15, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

We need to clarify the above following various recent debacles. Firstly, we need to go tell all admins about it, as some still don't know that it exists and are flooding. Either tell them, or block them for disruption.

Secondly, I have been told that non-admins cannot be blocked for flooding without a flag... but admins can. Unfair, much?

We need one rule for all, not different rules for different users, as is clearly the case at the moment. Certainly for point #2 it seems it is "better" to not be an admin...

I'd just like to bring this line up: "Unacceptable uses include attempting to circumvent legitimate oversight of any controversial action, regardless of whether it is an administrator task or not.". That kind of proves my block was inappropriate, and I am re-opening a RfdA for Scream (not directly related to this topic, but as the rest all keep on being archived...) 15:26, 13 July 2009 (UTC) 
"reset" It's hardly hacking the system. Nor does it take much doing. It was one of the first things I did on a wiki as an average user. This is getting OT now. 18:20, 13 July 2009 (UTC) 

I would not block based on flooding the RC since I think this wiki is too obsessed with the RC. That being said I don't believe the block being referred to was actually for flooding but for refusing to discuss which is a valid block. That being said that is just my assumption, NVS would have to give his reasons since he did it. - () 16:00, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

Administrators, please remember to remove closed RFDs from the RFD page. 21:45, 16 July 2009 (UTC)




Could we get a bot, which remove the closed RfDs after 24 hours? And it would be great if a bot could chack, if an discussion is closed and move them automatically to the other section. WOuld this be possible? () 21:10, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

Kennedy, sorry that no one has answered your question yet. These actions were generally to hide page creations where the title was libelous and obscene; usernames have been hidden, edits within pages that were libelous have also been oversighted as haves edit summaries for those edits or other edits where they have also been libelous, contained personally identifiable information or of a particularly vicious attack nature. One edit, for instance, was an attack against a person that explained where they would be on a daily basis. Another was of a vicious attack nature of a known WMF editor. If you have further questions, feel free to ask me and I can answer them for you. Over a dozen have been made. Cheers! 19:47, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

Hi all!

The feature is now stable. I want to ask you, if the community (especially the admins) want to enable this tool for admins. It would be easy to delete revisions, which are copyvios. If we want to delete a version of an article, we have to delete the article and later restore it. The tools was only enabled for oversighters, but is now stable and could be used, if the community want this. () 11:30, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

@DJSasso and Barras: Thanks for clearing that up. I've never actually needed to restore revisions yet, so was unaware of the exact details of what would occur. Given this, I'm neutral. 17:27, 15 July 2009 (UTC)



Why are we deleting articles mere seconds after they are created... we give the article starter no time to finish starting an article. Why? Best, () 17:10, 25 July 2009 (UTC)

"'Decision: will "not" be blocked. As former admin on the enwiki (where he is mostly active), he is not a single purpose account. Even if he isn't really active on this project is that not a blocking reason. Further more, users objected a block. No block for Ryulong. () 10:53, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

Block requested because of bad username. () 20:29, 25 July 2009 (UTC)

I've mirrored the Title blacklist, from the Enwiki, theirs is actually a bit more up to date. This should preclude the latest username issues we have been seeing. Regex guru's please also add the new aspie vandal naming scheme at your pleasure. Please revert me at your discretion as well. Thanks, () 05:45, 26 July 2009 (UTC)


I've been reviewing the and I have determined this to be a "disruptive" . This is disruptive because this editor is here for just one purpose. The deletion of a single article. Also, the editor has been disrupting the article by removing interwiki links, even when the bots are reinserting them. This editor has one target, the user who created the article, and the article itself. If there are no objections, I'll be blocking the account shortly. Best, () 19:03, 25 July 2009 (UTC)

(outdent) JC, the editor has less than 50 changes, and more than 1/2 of those are directed to this area. () 19:21, 25 July 2009 (UTC)

What the hell? I'm a single purpose account on this project because of my edits to make sure that the Disney Anon's articles are deleted? I don't edit here very often, but I've amassed over 90,000 edits over at en.wp, where I was a sysop for two and a half years. NonvocalScream should know that because I see his/her name every so often at en.wp. So what if I've been pruning the article for The Seventh Brother and I requested its deletion? It is because I feel the film is not notable and it should be deleted for that reason and that it was the creations of a banned user. This is the most ridiculous request I've seen on any language project I've ever been involved in. And I frequent the Japanese Wikipedia where they routinely RFD articles because someone added copyrighted text to the article.— () 10:26, 26 July 2009 (UTC)


This is getting even more ridiculous. NonvocalScream, I don't know the policies here. I know that there are rules at en.wiki that state that edits by users who have been banned are to be removed. That is what I plainly said in my edit summary. I am not disrupting this project. I can see you've completely ignored my message to you on your en.wp user talk. Your actions are total BS. I will say it here and I will say it at en.wp. I don't know how you managed to get sysop here, but comments like these, when you know I have an extensive history on other language projects, are really out of line. So I am trying to get as many language versions of The Seventh Brother that were spammed across multiple language Wikipedia projects deleted. That makes me a SPA? If this is how you are treating me simply because I do not contribute to this project as much as I do others, I am appalled. Drop it. I'm not getting blocked, I'm going to edit pages that I wish, and I will improve this project by doing as much as I can in the way I want to.— () 09:38, 27 July 2009 (UTC)

Should this user be allowed?
He has too much complex username (( -- () 09:45, 26 July 2009 (UTC)


I think that username is against policy. Usernamehardblock requested. () 02:11, 28 July 2009 (UTC)

1. I need the flooder right temporarily, and 2. I think that user's name is against username policy. () 01:15, 28 July 2009 (UTC)

I think that user's name is against policy, but I'm not sure. It mentions the word bot and the names of YotCmdr, BG7, Shappy and perhaps others. () 17:38, 28 July 2009 (UTC)

Since my closure of this RFB was objected to on my and the bit was requested to be removed and has been, I request an uninvolved bureaucrat to review the RFB and reclose it as they see fit taking into account all that has been said by all parties. 13:17, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

Hello. It appears the editors are inserting patently false information (with flimsy sourcing) while removing information (with good, reliable sourcing). I request semi protection for two weeks on Cannabis. () 15:58, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I believe user might be the Disney vandal (similar edits.) -- 19:54, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I know that there are a bit of *jew disruptive account creations. I'm interested in regexing to prevent those creations. I know a recent addition to the black list was removed due to the chance of false positive... can we formulate a regex that would work best? Thanks, () 00:31, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

Could an admin look at discussion and take the appropriate actions? Are they blocked or welcomed? () 22:12, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

Could an admin please add the word 'penis' and all of its variations to the black list? I can't think of a legitimate use of the word in a user name. () 21:20, 4 August 2009 (UTC)
New word: Vandal, with all the variations listed above. The list of letters is located at the bottom of the editing page, you will need them. () 22:43, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

Boy Scouts of America

The Boy Scouts of America or BSA is an organization for children and teens with over 5 million members across the United States. They try to give young people life values.

Boy Scouts are ages 11-17 and belong to troops, groups of Scouts associated with a church, school or post. Cub Scouts are scouts ages 6-10 and belong to packs. Cub Scouts include Tigers, Wolfs, Bears, and Webelos. Older Scouts can be Venturer Scouts.

The Boy Scouts of America were founded by American writer W. D. Boyce, in 1910, but were similar to Scouting groups in Great Britain and other early scout movements . James E. West helped out the BSA in its early years, but also made the BSA more religious than scouts were in Europe. Scouting grew in the 1910s and 20s due to the rise of “boy’s books” devoted to Scouting and the First World War. Scouting had many members during the 1960s, but has declined since the 1970s, despite an attempt to make scouting modern by changing requirements and adding more merit badges.

Over the years, the BSA has taken some stands that many Americans did not like. These included being against unions (organized workers) in the 1920s, requiring Scouts to believe in God, and not allowing gays to join Scouting.

When a scout joins a troop, he gets the "Scout Badge". After that, he can earn rank. There are six ranks in the Boy Scouts: Tenderfoot, 2nd Class, 1st Class, Star, Life and Eagle. The first three focus on learning basic scout skills, including camping, cooking, swimming, first aid (basic medical care), citizenship, orienteering (use of a map and compass), and pioneering (tying knots). The final three focus on earning merit badges, serving the troop and serving the community. Eagle Scouts must plan and finish a project that benefits something other than Scouting, and earn 21 merit badges. Only about 2 or 3% of Scouts earn Eagle, but some of the ones that have include Gerald Ford and Neil Armstrong.

Counterfeit

Counterfeit is the sale or manufacture of items that have not been made by genuine companies or have been made illegally. Nearly anything can be counterfeit, but it is mostly through cloths and other small items such as bags, medicines, money, watches, or jewellery. Most things can be sold without people realizing that they are counterfeit and that they could possibly be braking the law by buying the counterfeit goods.

Money can also be counterfeited. Sometimes people make fake cash, and this is considered to be counterfeit. The United States Secret Service investigates people who do this.

Bowler

A bowler is a person who bowls (throws) a ball to the batsman in the game of cricket. This is similar to the pitcher in a game of baseball. A bowler who can also bat well, is called an all rounder. There are different types of bowler, and a cricket team will usually have a mix of different types.

A fast bowler uses simple speed to defeat a batsman. They can send the ball to the batsman at a speed of 145 km/h. They take a long run up before bowling each ball to build speed. Shoaib Akhtar of Pakistan was the first to bowl at a speed of 160 km/h. Another famous fast bowler is Australian Brett Lee.

A medium pace bowler bowls more slowly. They often use other tricks to defeat the batsman. They can get the ball able to curve in the air or change the speed or length (where the ball hits the ground) to fool the batsman. Some are very accurate so they can repeatedly send the ball to a place which forces the batsman to defend rather than scoring runs. Others grip the ball so that it lands on its seam; this makes the path of the ball unpredictable.

A spin bowler usually bowls quite slowly and puts a lot of spin on the ball which makes it bounce at an angle off the ground. This makes the batsman play each ball carefully. Generally spin bowlers give up the most runs but they all have "tricks" that they use to fool the batsman and get him or her out. These tricks are given names such as the arm ball, googly, flipper, topspinner or doosra. Spin bowling is very much about fooling the batsman rather than speed. A fast Off Spin is the normal off spin action but with more pace. Off spin is when the cricket ball spins towards a right-handed batsmen's bat. With more pace, there usually is less turn (amount of spin). Off-spin is also called an Off-Break or Finger Spin. A famous spin bowler was the Australian Shane Warne.

Dynamic and formal equivalence

Dynamic and formal equivalence are concepts from linguistics. When a language is translated into another one, there is a problem: the meaning of a word or a phrase in the first language is not the same as that of the word or phrase in the second language. The first language may also have grammatical structures that do not exist in the second language. This is a problem for translation.

There are two possible ways to solve this problem:

Kin selection

Kin selection or kin altruism is a form of natural selection. Some animals cooperate with relatives, even if this brings risk to themselves. The classic example of this is seen in the family life of mammals, or in colonial insects such as ants. 

Many mammals and birds raise alarms to warn others of danger. Others cooperate in tasks, such as scrub jays help each other with to build nests. In all these cases where animals cooperate, the question is whether there is any biological benefit to themselves. It is now clear that there is benefit if the animals are closely related. This is because related organisms have (to a degree) a shared genetic inheritance.

The first to write about the concept were by R.A. Fisher in 1930, and J.B.S. Haldane in 1955, but it was W.D. Hamilton who truly formalized the concept. The actual term "kin selection" was probably coined by John Maynard Smith, when he wrote: 

By cooperating, relatives influence each other's fitness. Under natural selection, a gene which improves the fitness of individuals will increase in frequency. A gene which lowers the fitness of individuals will become rare. 

However, behaviour which enhances the fitness of relatives but lowers that of the actor, may nonetheless increase in frequency. Relatives do, by definition, carry many of the same genes. This is the fundamental principle behind the theory of kin selection. According to the theory, the enhanced fitness of relatives may more than compensate for the fitness loss of the helpers (individuals displaying the behaviour). 

This is a special case of a more general model, called inclusive fitness.

Hamilton's equation describes whether or not a gene for helping behaviour will spread in a population. The gene will spread if rxb is greater than c:

Foraging

Foraging is the act of hunting or gathering food. For example, cattle forage grass to eat. The idea of animals foraging is called "forage theory", and was first proposed in 1966.

Humans that forage are often called hunter-gatherers, who find and eat (wild) animals and plants without domestication of them (people who farm plants are not hunter-gatherers, as they have grown them themselves).

Pacific Northwest

The Pacific Northwest is a region on the west coast of North America. It refers to the northwestern corner of the United States and the southwestern part of Canada. The U.S. states of Washington, Idaho, western Montana, Oregon and northern California are located in the southern part of the Pacific Northwest. The Canadian province of British Columbia and the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Alaska is in the northern part. The entire region is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west.

Historically, the Pacific Northwest had many Native Americans. Starting from about 15,000 years ago, Native Americans settled along the coastline and along the major rivers. From the 1500s to the 1700s, Europeans explored the region, beginning with the discovery of Oregon and Washington. In the early 1800s, the famous Lewis and Clark expedition arrived in Washington State. From the 19th century to present day, the region began to become settled. Today, the largest cities in the Northwest include Vancouver, Seattle and Portland.

The rugged mountains of the Northwest consist of the Coast Range, which is nearer the coast, and the Cascade Range. In northern Washington, the Cascade Range is called the North Cascades. In British Columbia, it is called the Canadian Cascades. The many rivers of the Northwest result from its wet climate - the mountains trap wet Pacific air, leaving little rain for inland states like Idaho. The rivers once supported large salmon runs, but large power dams have been built on many rivers.

The main language of the Pacific Northwest is English in the United States and French in Canada; among the Native Americans Chinook Jargon is common. Among the many Asian immigrants, Chinese is receiving growing use in the Northwest. The United States part of the Northwest is known for its low religious population.

The Pacific Northwest basically extends from southeastern Alaska to Northern California. Along this entire length, is a large mountain range, the Cascade Range, that forms the geographic spine of the Pacific Northwest. The highest mountain in the Northwest is Mount Rainier. Rainier is high. Other notable mountains include Mount Shasta, at , and Mount Baker, at . East of the Cascades, there is the Columbia Plateau, a high area of land that stretches east to the Rocky Mountains in Idaho and Montana. In the west, the Coast Range borders the coast more closely. The Olympic Mountains are on the Olympic Peninsula, an extension of Washington State. Puget Sound is a large system of bays and straits in northwestern Washington and southeastern British Columbia.

The main rivers of the Pacific Northwest are the Fraser River, the Columbia River, and the Snake River. The Fraser River is mainly in British Columbia; it flows west to the Pacific Ocean near Vancouver. The Fraser drains most of the southern Canadian Cascades. The Columbia River begins in the Canadian Cascades and flows south, then turns west where it meets the Snake River. From there, it flows on to the ocean near Portland. The Snake River is mainly in inland Idaho. After a journey west from the Rocky Mountains, it meets the Columbia at Kennewick, Washington.

Other river of the Northwest include the Finlay, the Skagit, the Umpqua, the Rogue, and the Klamath. The Finlay drains the northern Canadian Cascades and flows on to join the Mackenzie River, which flows through Canada to Hudson Bay. The Skagit also begins in the Canadian Cascades, and crosses into Washington; it turns west and flows into the sea north of Everett, Washington. The Umpqua River begins in the Southern Oregon Cascades, and flows west to the Pacific Ocean near Reedsport, Oregon. The Rogue parallels the Umpqua and dumps into the sea at Gold Beach, Oregon. The Klamath flows south from a valley in inland Oregon, then turns west through northern California, cutting through the Cascade Range to its mouth near Klamath, California.

<doc id="191821" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=191821" title="Adaptation">
Adaptation

Adaptation is the evolutionary process where an organism becomes better suited to its habitat. This process takes place over many generations. It is one of the basic phenomena of biology.

When people speak about adaptation, they often mean a "feature" (a trait) which helps an animal or plant survive. An example is the adaptation of horses' teeth to grinding grass. Grass is their usual food; it wears the teeth down, but horses' teeth continue to grow during life. Horses also have adapted to run fast, which helps them to escape their predators, such as lions. These features are the "product" of the process of adaptation.

The better adapted animals are the most likely to survive, and to reproduce successfully. This process is known as natural selection; it is the basic cause of evolutionary change. 

Adaptation is, first of all, a "process", rather than a physical part of a body. 

An internal parasite (such as a fluke) is a good example: it has a very simple bodily structure, but still the organism is highly adapted to its particular environment. From this we see that adaptation is not just a matter of visible traits: in such parasites critical adaptations take place in the life cycle, which is often quite complex. 

However, as a practical term, adaptation is often used for the "product": those features of a species which result from the process. Many aspects of an animal or plant can be correctly called adaptations, though there are always some features whose function is in doubt. By using the term "adaptation" for the evolutionary "process", and "adaptive trait" for the bodily part or function (the product), the two senses of the word may be distinguished.

Adaptation is one of the two main processes that explain the diverse species we see in biology. The other is speciation (species-splitting or cladogenesis). A favourite example used today to study the interplay of adaptation and speciation is the evolution of cichlid fish in African lakes.

An organism must be viable at all stages of its development and at all stages of its evolution. This places "constraints" on the evolution of development, behaviour and structure of organisms. 

The general idea is that each genetic and phenotypic change during evolution should be relatively small, because developmental systems are so complex and interlinked. But polyploidy in plants is a fairly common large genetic change. The origin of the eukaryota by the symbiosis of micro-organisms is a more exotic example.

All adaptations help organisms survive in their ecological niches. This implies an increase in biological fitness.

These adaptive traits may be structural, behavioural or physiological. Structural adaptations are physical features of an organism (shape, body covering, armament; and also the internal organization). 

Behavioural adaptations are composed of inherited behaviour chains and/or the ability to learn: behaviours may be inherited in detail (instincts), or a tendency for learning may be inherited (see neuropsychology). Examples: searching for food, sex, vocalizations. 

Physiological adaptations permit the organism to perform special functions (for instance, making venom, secreting slime, phototropism); but also more general functions such as growth and development, temperature regulation, ionic balance and other aspects of homeostasis. Adaptation, then, affects all aspects of the life of an organism.

Not all features of an organism are adaptations. It may need field investigations or experiments to find out what its function is in the life of the species. 

Adaptations tend to reflect the past life of a species. If a species has recently changed its life style, a once valuable adaptation may become a dwindling vestige. Animals which live in dark caves often lose, over a long period, their colours and eyesight. 

The reasons for this may vary. The loss of structure and function may be a positive adaptation which saves energy and materials. But it may be simply a by-product of genes selected for other functions (pleiotropy). Or the structure may be linked in development, and affected by selection for another structure. 

It is a general rule that any adaptations which are no longer useful either become vestigial organs (see vermiform appendix), or may be selected and adapted to other functions (see ear ossicles).

It is a profound truth that Nature does not know best; that genetical evolution... is a story of waste, makeshift, compromise and blunder. "Peter Medawar".

Adaptations are never perfect. There are always tradeoffs between the various functions and structures in a body. It is the organism as a whole which lives and reproduces, therefore it is the complete set of adaptations which gets passed on to future generations.

All adaptations have a downside: horse legs are great for running on grass, but they cannot scratch their backs; mammals' hair helps temperature, but offers a niche for ectoparasites. Compromise and make-shift occur widely, not perfection. Selection pressures pull in different directions, and the adaptation that results is some kind of compromise.

Since the phenotype as a whole is the target of selection, it is impossible to improve simultaneously all aspects of the phenotype to the same degree. "Ernst Mayr".

Camouflage to avoid detection is destroyed when vivid colours are displayed at mating time. Here the risk to life is counterbalanced by the necessity for reproduction. The peacock's ornamental train (grown anew in time for each mating season) is a famous adaptation. It must reduce his maneuverability and flight, and is hugely conspicuous; also, its growth costs food resources. 

Darwin's explanation of its advantage was in terms of sexual selection: "it depends on the advantage which certain individuals have over other individuals of the same sex and species, in relation to reproduction". The kind of sexual selection represented by the peacock is called 'mate choice', meaning the process selects the more fit over the less fit, and so has survival value. In practice, the blue peafowl "Pavo cristatus" is a pretty successful species, with a big natural range in India, so the overall outcome of their mating system is quite viable.

The size of the human foetal brain at birth means the brain of a newborn child is quite immature. The newborn's brain cannot be larger than about 400ccs, else it will not get through the mother's pelvis. Yet the size needed for an adult brain is about 1400ccs.

The most vital things in human life (locomotion, speech) just have to wait while the brain grows and matures. That is the result of the birth compromise. Much of the problem comes from our upright bipedal stance, without which our pelvis could be shaped more suitably for birth. Neanderthals had a similar problem.

The following definitions are mainly due to Theodosius Dobzhansky.

<doc id="191829" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=191829" title="San Felipe de Puerto Plata">
San Felipe de Puerto Plata

The Dominican city of San Felipe de Puerto, usually called just Puerto Plata is the head municipality of the Puerto Plata province, on the north (Atlantic) coast of the country.

The municipality has the Atlantic Ocean to the north, the municipalities of Villa Montellano and Sosúa to the east, the Santiago province to the south, the municipality of Altamira to the southwest and the municipalities of Luperón and Imbert to the west.

The name Puerto Plata (in English, "Silver Port") came from the name given by Columbus to the mountain just to the south of the city: "Monte de Plata" (in English, "Silver Mountain") because the mountain always had clouds on its top and not because there was the metal silver; that mountain now is called Isabel de Torres mountain (in Spanish, the complete name is "Loma Isabel de Torres"). Isabel de Torres was a lady who lived in Puerto in 1605 and had a lot of land in the mountain.

The city was called first "Puerto de Plata" but later it was changed to just "Puerto Plata", the name that is still used.

The municipality had, in 2002, a total population of 146,882: 72,295 men and 74,587 women. The urban population was 76.28% of the total population. In this numbers are included the population of the municipal districts of Maimón and Yásica Arriba.

More persons live here than in any other municipality of the province. In 2002 (the last national census), the population of the Puerto Plata municipality was 46.97% of the total population of the province, and the city of Puerto Plata had 35.83% of the population of the province.

The municipality of Puerto Plata has an area of 459.71 km². There are two municipal districts in the municipality (a municipal district in the Dominican Republic are similar to municipalities but they depend on a municipality). Those municipal districts are:

The "Cordillera Septentrional" (in English, "Northern mountain range") runs along the southern half of the municipality. There are only two roads that go through this mountain range. It rains a lot in these mountains. 

The mountain "Loma Isabel de Torres" (the "Monte de Plata" of Columbus) is 5 km to the southeast of the city of Puerto Plata. It stands alone even if it is part of the Cordillera Septentrional. On top of the mountain, there is rainforest because it gets a lot of rain there; it rains almost every day. That forest is now a national park.

It is 799 m high and there are two ways for getting to the top: by road or by a cable car (a type of car that runs on cables above the car).

There are many rivers in the municipality but, because the Cordillera Septentrional is close to the coast, they are all very short. The two most important rivers are Camú del Norte and Yásica. Two small rivers that are close to the city are San Marcos and Muñoz.

There are some bays along the coast. Two of them are the "Puerto Plata Bay" and "Maimón Bay".

Columbus visited the Puerto Plata Bay on 11 January 1493. The city was founded and built by Nicolás de Ovando in 1502. Soon it became the most important port in the northern coast of the Hispaniola island and, in 1508, the king of Spain gave a coat of arms to the city.

Because there were many pirates and other British and French ships along the northern coast of the island, a fort was built here by orders of Carlos I, king of Spain; its construction took several years and it was finished in 1577. Because at that moment the Spanish's king was Felipe II, the fort was named Fuerte San Felipe (in English, "Saint Phillip Fort").

In 1606, those that were living in the towns of Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi were ordered by the Spanish king to move to the southeast of the island and to found a new town: Monte Plata. Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi were, then, destroyed. They were founded again in the 18th century with families that came from the Canary Islands.

The North Cascades are a name used for the mountains at the north end of the Cascade Range, south of Canada. The North Cascades are entirely in the United States, in the state of Washington. At the Canadian border, the North Cascades are called the Canadian Cascades. The highest point in the North Cascades is Mount Baker (10,781 ft/3,286m). North Cascades National Park is located at the northernmost end of the North Cascades.

Some of the primary rivers in the North Cascades are the Skagit, Nooksack, Stillaguamish, and Stehekin. Lake Chelan is the largest lake in the North Cascades. Although now termed a reservoir, it was originally a natural lake, but enlarged by a dam. The urban areas of Seattle, Tacoma and Everett are all west of the North Cascades. The Columbia River, Washington's largest river, forms the east and south boundary.

The Point!

The Point! is a 1971 animated cartoon movie, written by singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson and Carole Beers, and directed by Fred Wolf. It first appeared on ABC television, in the United States. It starred the voices of Mike Lookinland ("Bobby" of "The Brady Bunch" fame), and actor Dustin Hoffman. (Later editions replaced Hoffman's voice with that of Alan Thicke, then musician Ringo Starr.)

"The Point!" tells a story about a boy named Oblio, who is the only round-headed person in a land full of people and animals with pointed heads. Banished to the Pointless Forest for not to what is "normal", Oblio and his dog Arrow (whose head was pointed, but he was still loyal to Oblio) meet many different people, and come to learn that everything and everyone indeed has a "point"; a purpose for being what they are. Oblio and Arrow return home, bringing back what they have learned to share with everyone.

Nilsson said later the inspiration for "The Point!" was an LSD experience. Resting on the ground, he noticed everything (trees, buildings) that reached into the sky from the ground came to a "point", leading Nilsson to believe that "everything has a point, and if it doesn't, then there's a point to that". Nilsson developed this idea into a story about tolerance, and acceptance of in others.

Nilsson devoted a whole album to music from "The Point!", alternating songs from the show with his own of the story. "Me And My Arrow" became the breakout hit from the album, with a single reaching the Top 20 in the American music charts. (The song was later used in a commercial, for the Plymouth Arrow automobile.)

Nilsson later adapted "The Point!" into a musical stage play, that featured more of his own songs. A London production of the play reunited former Monkees Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones, who were also friends of Nilsson's.

Darwinius masillae is a genus of primates from the Eocene epoch, dated to 47 million years ago. The genus "Darwinius" was named to celebrate Charles Darwin on his bicentenary and the species name masillae honors Messel where the specimen was found. The creature appeared superficially similar to a modern lemur.

The only known fossil, dubbed 'Ida', was discovered in 1983 at the Messel pit, a disused shale quarry noted for its astonishing fossil preservation, near the village of Messel, about 35 km (22 mi) southeast of Frankfurt am Main in Germany. The fossil, divided into a slab and partial counterslab after the amateur excavation and sold separately, was not reassembled until 2007.

Buxton is a spa town in Derbyshire, England. It is the highest market town in England. Buxton is near to Cheshire and Staffordshire. Buxton is described as "the gateway to the Peak District National Park". Buxton is also close to Manchester.

"Poole's Cavern", a limestone cavern, and St Ann's Well are in Buxton. Also in the town is an Opera House.

The Romans developed the town when it was called Aquae Arnemetiae (or the spa of the goddess of the grove). Roman coins have been found in Buxton. The town largely grew in importance in the late 18th century when it was developed by the Dukes of Devonshire, with a second revival a hundred years later as the people visited to use the healing properties of the waters.

The Dukes of Devonshire have been helping Buxton since 1780, when the Duke used his money from his copper mines to develop the town as a spa like Bath.

Bess of Hardwick had taken one of her four husbands, the Earl of Shrewsbury, to "take the waters" at Buxton shortly after he became the jailer of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1569.

Dr. Erasmus Darwin recommended the waters at Buxton to Josiah Wedgwood. The Wedgwood family often went to Buxton on holiday. Two of Charles Darwin's half-cousins, Edward Levett Darwin and Reginald Darwin also settled there.



Buxton is twinned with two other towns—Oignies in France and Bad Nauheim in Germany.

Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a 1865 book written by English author and mathematics professor, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll. The story was started out as an entertainment on a summer outing, three years before the story was written and published. Dodgson told these tales to three little girls, (whom one of them was named Alice), and one day, Alice asked Dodgson to write the "Alice" tales down as a storybook. Dodgson accepted the task, but the manuscript of story, (originally entitled "Alice's Adventures Under Ground"), took two years, (with many delays), to complete. Finally, Dodgson prepared the "Alice" story for publication, adding more events, such as the Mad Tea Party chapter, more characters, such as the Cheshire Cat, and changing the title as "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland". The story was so popular, that Dodgson, (under the pen name Lewis Carroll), wrote a sequel called "Through the Looking Glass", and through out the years, the classic story, (often shortening the title to "Alice in Wonderland"), is popularized in music, movies and plays.

It begins with Alice being bored while sitting with her sister at a riverbank on a sleepy, sunny afternoon. Suddenly, the White Rabbit rushes by Alice in a great hurry and looking at his watch. Burning with curiosity, Alice follows the White Rabbit down the rabbit-hole to Wonderland, a place where everyone is wacky, trials and tea parties are improper, and solving peculiar riddles without any answers. Through out the story, Alice changes sizes and encounter several Wonderland residents, like the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and many more to get to the beautiful garden. In the end, Alice's adventures turned out to be a dream as Alice wakes up to go home for tea.

Three-body problem

The three-body problem is a problem in the field of physics that experts find interesting. 

When a thing is moving, it has energy of movement. Scientists use a short-cut when they talk about this energy, they call it 'E.' The energy "E" of movement is assumed by scientists to be small compared to their mass, allowing such experts to describe the bodies with non-relativistic mechanics. This implies that all the movement refers to velocities small compared to the speed of light "c".

In a field called classical mechanics, experts say that movement with higher velocities causes the radiation of gravitational waves. Under this discipline, the system cannot be considered "conservative".

Experts in another field called quantum mechanics, say, in addition, at high speed the creation and annihilation of particles becomes possible, so, it is not possible to keep the number of particles constant. 

The three-body problem also happens in astronomy. The problem consists in calculating the course of three bodies, that influence each other with gravitation. The first to state the problenm was Isaac Newton, in "Principia". Usually, two of the bodies are large, and the third is small. In the case where the two bodies have the same gravitational force, and that the bodies all have the same mass can be solved exactly. If this is not the case, the problem is lsoved through iteration and approximation.

Trophallaxis

Trophallaxis in biology refers the sharing of food by members of a community. 

It is most highly developed in social insects such as ants, termites, wasps and bees. The word was introduced by the entomologist William Morton Wheeler in 1918. The behaviour has been used to explain theories of how social behaviour developed in insects. The French psychologist and entomologist August Forel also believed that food sharing was key to ant society. He used an illustration of it as the frontispiece for his book "The social world of the ants compared with that of man".

Trophallaxis serves as a means of communication, at least in bees and ants. In some species of ants, it may play a role in spreading the colony odour that identifies members.

Nikolaus Harnoncourt

Nikolaus Harnoncourt (born Berlin, 6 December 1929) is an Austrian conductor. He is famous for his conducting music from many years ago using orchestras with period instruments.

Harnoncourt was born into a noble family who were related to the Holy Roman Emperors and other European royalties. His full name was Count Nikolaus de la Fontaine und d'Harnoncourt-Unverzagt. He was brought up in Graz, Austria and studied music in Vienna.

From 1952 to 1969 he was a cellist with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. He soon became interested in performing old music with period instruments. He started a group called Concentus Musicus Wien. They tried to make the music of composers from the Baroque period sound like it had done when it was written. Harnoncourt played the viola da gamba as well as the cello. In 1970 he conducted Monteverdi's opera "Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria" at La Scala, Milan.
In 1971, Harnoncourt started to work with the conductor Gustav Leonhardt. They recorded all of J.S. Bach's cantatas. This project took until 1990 to finish. He also recorded Bach's "St. Matthew Passion". He performed with many other orchestras, including the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. Often they were orchestras who used modern instruments, but he tried to make them play with an understanding of a historical style (bowing, phrasing etc). Like other musicians working with historical instruments, he gradually realized that music from later periods such as the Classical music period and even the Romantic period used to sound different from what we usually hear today. He recorded the symphonies and concertos of Beethoven. He received many awards for these recordings.

Harnoncourt and his wife Alice have had four children.

Vienna Symphony

The Vienna Symphony () is an orchestra in Vienna, Austria.

The orchestra was formed in 1900 by the conductor Ferdinand Löwe. It was then called the "Wiener Concertverein" (Vienna Concert Society). In 1913 it moved into the Konzerthaus, Vienna. In 1919 it joined with the Tonkünstler Orchestra. In 1933 it got the name it has today: Vienna Symphony (Wiener Symphoniker).

During World War II the Nazis forced them to be part of the German Culture Orchestras and they were used for propaganda. They stopped playing in 1944.

Their first concert after the war was on 16 September 1945, when they performed Gustav Mahler's "Symphony No. 3". Their conductor Josef Krips quickly helped them to become a great orchestra. From 1946 they were often conducted by Herbert von Karajan who toured with them throughout Europe and North America. In 1959 the VSO performed for Pope John XXIII at Vatican City.

When Wolfgang Sawallisch became their conductor he toured with them to the United States and Japan.

Today Fabio Luisi is their chief conductor.

Most of the text has not been translated, because the Etruscan language is only known little. According to the few words that can be understood, the text is probably a ritual calendar.

The fabric of the book was preserved when it was used to wrap a mummy from Ptolemaic Egypt. The mummy and the manuscript are now kept in a refrigerated room at the Archaeological Museum in Zagreb, Croatia.

Eel River

The Eel River is a river in the north part of the U.S. state of California. It flows north about 200 mi (322 km) to the Pacific Ocean, draining 3,684 square miles (9,542 square km). Its largest tributary is the Middle Fork Eel River, followed by the South Fork, Van Duzen River, and North Fork. The river is dammed near its headwaters to divert water into the Russian River valley. The two dams form Van Arsdale Reservoir and the larger Lake Pillsbury. Most of the river is in the humid Coast Ranges of California. Much of the river is isolated, in steep and rugged terrain. 

Towns along the Eel include Ferndale, Rio Dell, and Dos Rios (at the confluence with the Middle Fork). Weott is near the South Fork confluence.

U.S. Highway 101 follows the river until the South Fork confluence, and the Great Northern Railway also follows a portion of the river. 37 bridges cross the Eel and 24 cross the South Fork. The South Fork is the longest tributary. The Middle Fork has the largest watershed.

<doc id="192073" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=192073" title="Cardamom">
Cardamom

Cardamom is used for two herbs related to ginger. Their seeds are used as a spice. The two species are named "Elettaria" and "Amomum", respectively. The seeds grow in a small seedpod. This seedpod is triangular in cross-section and has the shape of a spindle. There is a thin papery outer shell and small black seeds. Elettaria pods are light green in color, Amomum pods are larger and dark brown.

Elettaria is commonly known as "cardamom", "green cardamom" or "true cardamom". It grows from India to Malaysia. 

Amomum is usually called "black cardamom", or "white cardamom". It grows in Asia and Australia.

Both forms of cardamom are used to add flavor to both food and drink, as cooking spices and as a medicine. 
"Elettaria cardamomum" (the usual type of cardamom) is used as a spice and in medicine; it is also smoked sometimes; it is used as a food plant by the larva of the moth "Endoclita hosei".

Cardamom has a strong taste and an intense smell. Black cardamom has coolness similar to that of mint. It is commonly used in Indian cooking. In Scandinavia it is often used for baking. 

Green cardamom is one of the most expensive spices by weight but little is needed to give the flavor. Cardamom is best stored in pod form. Once the seeds are exposed or ground, they quickly lose their flavor. High-quality ground cardamom powder can often be a substitute for the pods. That way, ten pods is about the same quantity as one and a half teaspoons of ground cardamom. 

In the Middle East, green cardamom powder is used as a spice for sweet dishes. Traditionally, it is also added as a flavoring to coffee and tea there. In Arabic, cardamom is called "al-Hayl". In Persian, it is called "hel". In Hebrew, it is also called "hel" (הל). In Gujarati (a derivative of Sanskrit), it is "Ē-lī-chē".
In some Middle Eastern countries, coffee and cardamom are often ground in a wooden mortar and cooked together in a mihbaz, an oven using wood or gas, to produce mixtures that are as much as forty percent cardamom.

In South Asia, green cardamom is often used in traditional Indian sweets and in "Masala chai (spiced tea)". 

Black cardamom is sometimes used in garam masala for curries. It is occasionally used as a garnish in basmati rice and other dishes. It is often referred to as fat cardamom due its size ('Moti Elaichi'). Individual seeds are sometimes chewed, in much the same way as chewing-gum. It has also been known to be used to make gin.

In South Asia, Green cardamom is often used to treat infections of the teeth and gums. It is also used against troubles of the throat, congestion of the lungs and pulmonary tuberculosis, inflammation of eyelids and also digestive disorders. It has been used to break up kidney and gall stones, and as an antidote against the poison of certain snake bites. 

"Amomum" is used as a spice and as an ingredient in traditional medicine in systems of the traditional Chinese medicine in China, in Ayurveda in India, Japan, Korea and Vietnam.
Among other species, varieties and cultivars, "Amomum villosum" cultivated in China, Laos and Vietnam is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat stomach-aches, constipation, dysentery, and other digestion problems. "Tsaoko" cardamom "Amomum tsao-ko" is cultivated in Yunnan, China and northwest Vietnam, both for medicinal purposes and as a spice.

The demand for these herbs has increased since the 1980s. Growing cardamom has become an important source of income for many poor farmers. These people usually live in higher altitudes, sometimes in remote areas, in China, Laos and Vietnam. 

Until recently, Nepal has been the world's largest producer of large cardamom. Guatemala has become the world's largest producer and exporter of cardamom, with an export total of US$137.2 million for 2007.

The size of the motor is usually 49cc, much smaller than most motorcycle motors. Because of the small motor, mopeds usually can not go faster than 50 kph (30 mph). Mopeds use less fuel than motorcycles, but some people complain that mopeds create more air pollution than motorcycles. Most of the time, you need a special license to ride a motorcycle but you only need an ordinary driver's license to ride a moped. It is usually illegal to ride a moped without a helmet.

Algorithmic information theory

Algorithmic information theory is a field of theoretical computer science. It is concerned with how information and computation are related. Most information can be represented as a String (or a sequence of characters). Algorithmic information theory studies the complexity of information represented that way (In other words, how difficult it is to get that information, or how long it takes). Unlike regular information theory, it uses Kolmogorov complexity to describe complexity, and not the measure of complexity developed by Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver. Kolmogorov complexity was developed independently by Andrey Kolmogorov and Gregory Chaitin .

According to Claude Shannon the following two binary strings have the same content in information (this is only valid for the first-order entropy):

The first was generated with a random number generator, for example by throwing a coin. The second is easier to describe (eight times "1", then eight times "0"). For this reason, the first sequence has more algorithmic information, because it is harder to shorten ("compress") the description on how to generate it. Shortening the description may not be possible at all. The information value of a string is higher, if it is more difficult to shorten ("compress") its description. Random strings and white noise do not contain patterns that occur again. For this reason they cannot be compressed, and have a higher information value.

Tawhīd

Tawhid is the concept of God in Islam which says that only one God exists. It says that God is unique and one and it has no equal. Moreover it says that since the God is the only creator so there is no room for lesser Gods or deities and hence such conceptions are false. Tawhid is an essential part of Islam. To become a Muslim it is necessary to accept it. The concept of Tawhid contains many implications. Since God is the only power hence both good and bad flow from God. Hence whatever good or bad occurs to an individual, both are from God and both should be accepted by man. Moreover since God is the only power worth worshiping, reliance on any other source for help is not permissible.

The Quran explains the nature of God thus in Chapter 112:

Say: He is God the Only; God the Indivisible; He gives not birth, nor is He begotten, and He is, in Himself, not dependent on anything.
Associating any other thing or person as being comparable to God is called "shirk" in Islam. This is the only sin in Islam which cannot be forgiven by God, unless a person turns repentent on Earth. Muslims reject the three in one God concept in Christianity and say that Christ was a human being whom God chose as a prophet like other before him.

<doc id="192250" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=192250" title="Asperger syndrome">
Asperger syndrome

Asperger syndrome (often - incorrectly - Asperger's syndrome) affects the way in which a person understands other people, talks with other people, and acts with other people. A person who has Asperger syndrome may not fit in well with other people, and may be seen as strange. Asperger syndrome is a developmental disorder, not a mental illness. Most adults with Asperger syndrome can learn how to make friends, do useful work and live successful lives. Asperger syndrome is considered to be at the highest functioning end of the Autism spectrum disorders. Both sexes can have Asperger syndrome, although it is more common in males.

Asperger syndrome begins in early childhood. No one knows exactly what causes it, but it is thought to have a genetic cause. The part of the brain which controls a person's "social behavior" (understanding and communicating with other people) may grow or function differently in a person with Asperger syndrome. Another part of the brain that may be different is the part that controls some body movement such as balance. A person with this condition may walk or act in a clumsy way and have trouble doing body actions such as sports. They may also do physical actions repetitively, such as rocking, flapping their hands, or tapping their feet. The condition seems to run in families. Parents who have Asperger syndrome often have children who have it or another kind of autism.

Asperger syndrome cannot be found by testing blood or looking at someone's body. A medical doctor needs to talk with the person and other people who know him or her well, to watch how the person moves and behaves, and to learn about the person's past. Sometimes a doctor believes by mistake that the person has schizophrenia, ADHD or mental retardation instead. Tourette syndrome with "tics" (repetitive, uncontrolled actions like twitching, blinking, coughing) sometimes comes with Asperger syndrome. Many people with Asperger syndrome also have ADHD.

People who have Asperger syndrome have normal or high intelligence. As children, they may need special help at home and school to learn social behavior. The syndrome cannot be made better by taking medicine. (People who have this condition are sometimes given medicine to help them with depression, which is often experienced by people with the syndrome.)

People with Asperger syndrome can have a hard time "fitting in" with other people. Adults who have it usually learn enough "coping skills" to act in a way that seems normal, but often with a few differences. Most people with the syndrome can communicate clearly with friends and family. They may have more difficulty in communicating with new people.

A "syndrome" is a pattern of signs and symptoms that doctors can see in many different people. Here is a list of symptoms of Asperger syndrome. Not every person with Asperger syndrome has every symptom.

People with Asperger syndrome: 


When people talk to each other, they use spoken words to communicate. They also use the sound of their voice and "non-verbal communication" such as facial expression, hand movements, and "body language" to give meaning to what they say. This means that while people are talking, they are also looking for signs in the other person's face and the movement of their body to tell how they are feeling and whether they mean exactly the same as their words are saying. When people talk, they use "non-verbal communication" to add more information to their words. People who have trouble with understanding non-verbal communication, like people with Asperger syndrome, will miss this extra information.

People with Asperger syndrome:


Asperger syndrome is sometimes called "wrong planet" syndrome because people with Asperger syndrome often feel that they are quite normal but are living in a world full of aliens. For a person with Asperger syndrome, having Asperger syndrome is normal, because they have had it all their life.

People with Asperger syndrome often:

In the 1940s, a doctor named Hans Asperger studied some children that were different from most other children that he knew, but were like each other. He called them "little professors" because he thought that they were interesting and wrote a book about them. Dr. Asperger thought his "little professors" had a different sort of personality.

In the 1980s Dr. Lorna Wing made up the name "Asperger syndrome" for people with high-functioning autism after research into Hans Asperger's work.

In 1994 Asperger syndrome was added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).

Dr. Tony Attwood, Dr. Simon Baron-Cohen and Dr. Uta Frith are three of the current leading authorities on Asperger syndrome.

Invariable plane

The invariable plane of a planetary system is the plane passing through its barycenter (center of mass). This is perpendicular to its angular momentum vector.

In the solar system, about 98% of this effect is contributed by the orbital angular momenta of the four gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). The invariable plane is within 0.5° of the orbital plane of Jupiter. It is the weighted average of all planetary orbital and rotational planes.

The invariable plane is simply derived from the sum of angular momenta, and is almost "invariable" (unchanging) over the entire system. In contrast, the "Laplace plane" may be different for different orbiting objects within a system. 

The Sun forms a counterbalance to all of the planets, so it is near the barycenter when Jupiter is on one side and the other three jovian planets (gas giants) are diametrically opposite on the other side, but the Sun moves to 2.17 solar radii away from the barycenter when all jovian planets are in line on other side. The orbital angular momenta of the Sun and all non-jovian planets, moons, and minor solar system bodies, as well as the axial rotation momenta of all bodies, including the Sun, total only about 2%.

For almost all purposes the plane can be considered invariable when working in Newtonian dynamics.

Sidereal day

A sidereal day is the length of time it takes a planet to rotate from the perspective of a distant star. For the planet Earth a sidereal day is approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds. 

Astronomers use sidereal time to keep track of the direction to turn the telescopes to view a star in the night sky.

By contrast, solar time is reckoned by the movement of the Earth from the perspective of the Sun. An average solar day (24 hours) is longer than a sidereal day (23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds) because of the amount the Earth moves each day in its orbit around the Sun.

Ja zuster, nee zuster

Ja zuster, nee zuster (in English: Yes Nurse, No Nurse) was a very popular comedy series on Dutch television in the late 1960s. It was set in a home for old people.

The series was broadcast between 1966 and 1968 and consisted of 20 episodes. 

The script was written by Annie M.G. Schmidt who was already very well known as a writer of books for children and scripts for television and radio programmes. The songs were written by Harry Bannink.

Dutch people today, especially those who remember the original series, are very disappointed that, apart from one programme, the whole series has been lost. This is because it was recorded on Ampex tape which was very expensive so, after the episodes had been shown on television, other television programmes were recorded on the same tape over the top of it. Some of the film that was shot outside has been preserved. 15 of the songs from the series have also been preserved. They were made into a gramophone record (LP) and later into a CD.

The stories in the television series are about a group of people who live in “Rusthuis Klivia”. The word “rusthuis” means “resthouse”. It is usually used in Dutch to describe an old people’s home (retirement home), although some of the actors in the programme were not really old. There was always chaos in the home. The characters were very strange. One of them grew spinach in the garden, one of them was an engineer who was always doing experiments in the cellar. One of them was a burglar. The neighbour tries to get everyone evicted (thrown out), but he never succeeds. 

Each episode had a guest actor who was often a well-known Dutch television personality.

There were many songs in the series. The most popular ones include "De kat van ome Willem" ("Uncle Williams’ Cat"), "Ja Zuster, Nee Zuster" ("Yes Nurse, No Nurse"), "Niet met de deuren slaan" ("Don’t bang the doors") and "M'n opa" ("My grandpa").

In 1999 a book was published with reconstructions of the stories. An exhibition was opened between November 2002 and March 2003 in Hoorn, North Holland. A musical is now being made which should be ready by 2009. It will be performed in many theatres throughout the Netherlands.

In 2009 he won his first career major with a playoff victory over 59-year old Tom Watson in The Open Championship.

On February 24, 2008, Cink was the runner-up in the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship played in Marana, Arizona, falling 8 & 7 in the 36-hole final to top-ranked Tiger Woods. In June 2008, he reached his highest ever ranking, sixth, in the Official World Golf Rankings with his victory at the Travelers Championship in suburban Hartford.

On July 19, 2009, Cink won his first major title at the 138th Open Championship at Turnberry, Scotland, defeating 59 year-old Tom Watson by six strokes in a four-hole playoff. Cink had birdied the 72nd hole while Watson bogeyed, which forced the playoff.

Bayreuth Festival

The Bayreuth Festival is a music festival held every year in Bayreuth, Germany, at which performances of operas by the 19th century German composer Richard Wagner are performed. It was Wagner's own idea to start a festival for his operas in Bayreuth in a theatre which he designed himself because he was not satisfied with the way that theatres were usually designed.

The theatre that he designed is called the Festspielhaus (Festival House). Wagner watched the theatre being built, making sure that it was done the way he wanted it. He had some new ideas about theatre design. For example: he wanted the orchestra pit to be so low that the orchestra would not be seen by the audience.

When the theatre was opened in 1876 his cycle of operas called the "Der Ring des Nibelungen" was performed complete for the first time. 

The festival immediately became internationally famous. Almost every serious musician in Europe wanted to go to Bayreuth to hear Wagner's music performed there. Composers usually either loved it and were strongly influenced by it, or they hated it and reacted against it.

The festival still continues now. Every August there is a festival of Wagner's operas. It is extremely difficult to get tickets because so many people want to go. People often wait for ten years before they can get a ticket.

Wagner wanted the festival to be in a small town where people could just concentrate on his music. Bayreuth already had a theatre, the Markgräfliches Opernhaus, but it was not suitable for modern opera. The town did not have a cultural life that would be in competition with Wagner's music. Another reason for choosing Bayreuth was that it was outside the area where the rights to perform his operas were not under his control (he had sold these rights many years earlier in order to raise money).

King Ludwig II of Bavaria gave a lot of money to Wagner to built the new opera house. Wagner also made tours across Germany to get money for it. Societies were established to raise money.
The architect who designed the opera house was Gottfried Semper. 

The opening took place on August 13, 1876, with a performance of Das Rheingold. A lot of important people were there, including Kaiser Wilhelm, Dom Pedro II of Brazil, King Ludwig (who came in secret, perhaps because he did not want to meet the Kaiser), and other members of the nobility, as well as the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, and the composers Anton Bruckner, Edvard Grieg, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, and Franz Liszt. Hans Richter was the conductor.

During Wagner's life the festival just performed the Ring Cycle and, later, his opera "Parsifal". After Wagner's death, his widow Cosima continued to run the festival. She gradually introduced the other operas Wagner had written, so that all ten operas were in the repertoire. The operas were always performed exactly as Wagner had done. Nothing was allowed to be changed in any way. 

After Cosima retired from running the festival in 1906, Wagner's son Siegfried took over management of the festival. He did some things differently, introducing new staging and performance styles. When he died in 1930 the festival was run by his widow Winifred.

In the 1920s, some years before the rise of the Nazi party, Winifred Wagner became a close friend of Adolf Hitler. Because of this, Bayreuth was able to continue getting a lot of money during the Nazi period. Wagner's works were used by the Nazi as propaganda tools. It is strange that Hitler went to performances in Bayreuth that included Jewish and foreign singers, long after they had been banned from performing in all other places in Germany. Winifred's influence with Hitler was so strong that Hitler even wrote a letter to the anti-fascist Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini, begging him to lead the festival. Toscanini refused.

It was during this time that the festival made its first break from tradition. They stopped using the 19th century scenery on the stage. Many people disagreed with this, including Toscanini and Richard Strauss, and even some members of the Wagner family. They thought it should stay exactly like Wagner had known it.

During the war, the Nazi party ran the festival. Operas were performed for soldiers who had been hurt in the fighting. These soldiers were forced to go to lectures on Wagner before the performances, even if they were not interested in music.

A lot of Bayreuth was destroyed by bombing in the last days of World War II, though the theatre itself was undamaged. After the war, Winifred Wagner was sentenced to probation by a war court because she had supported the Nazi party. Ironically, it was because of Winifred that the theatre was not bombed. She had not allowed it to be used for military purposes, so it was not a military target. After the war the theatre was used for other kinds of concerts for the next few years. The festival started again in 1951, opening with a performance of Beethoven's Symphony no 9, followed by a performance of Wagner's opera, "Parsifal"

Wieland Wagner, the composer's grandson, had some very new ideas, including very abstract scenery. Some of the audience even booed. What Wieland was trying to do was to make a big break from the past with its association with Hitler. Wieland died in 1966. For a time people wondered whether the festival would continue. There were a lot of arguments within the Wagner family. Wieland's brother Wolfgang Wagner remained in charge of running the festival for the next 42 years, while the money was controlled by the Richard Wagner Foundation.

Wieland Wagner started a workshop in Bayreuth in which directors could meet and discuss new ideas for presenting the operas. This made it easier for new ideas to be accepted, and gave new life to the festival.

The centenary of the festival was celebrated in 1976 with a great production of the Ring directed by the French director Patrice Chereau. His production concentrated on showing how the Ring was about the 19th century working class being used by the wealthy capitalists. Some people thought it was the best opera performance they had ever seen, others hated it.

There has been a lot of uncertainty about what would happen after Wolfgang retired. Many people wanted the festival to continue to be in the hands of the Wagner family. On 1 September 2008, Wolfgang Wagner's daughters, Eva Wagner-Pasquier and Katharina Wagner, were named by Bavaria's culture minister to take over the Festival. They have said that they want to "bring opera to the people" . In 2009 Wagner's opera "Tristan und Isolde" will be live on the web. It will only cost £12.90 to watch online. People will also be able to watch it for free on a big screen in the centre of Bayreuth.

Repertoire

Repertoire (pronounce: "Re-per-twahr") is a French word used in music and in the theatre. It means a list of pieces of music or plays. Sometimes the English word repertory is used.

When a pianist speaks about his or her "repertoire", it means all the pieces that he can play. Most famous musicians have a wide repertoire (they can play a lot of pieces).

The "piano repertoire" means all music written for the piano. The violin has a much larger solo repertoire than the viola. That means that much more solo music has been written for the violin than for the viola.

A theatre company may have a "repertoire". That means all the plays that they regularly perform. Sometimes theatre companies are called "repertory theatres" because they have a particular list of plays that they perform.

Ludwig II (25 August 1845 in Nymphenburg Palace – 13 June 1886 in Lake Starnberg) was king of Bavaria from 1864 until shortly before his death (Bavaria is now part of Germany, but at that time it was a separate country). He is well known for his support for the composer Richard Wagner.

He is often referred to as the Mad King Ludwig because his behaviour was very odd. For example, he would leave his castle by climbing out of the window instead of walking out of the door. He is sometimes referred to as the Swan King in English and "der Märchenkönig" (the Fairy tale King) in German. This is because he built several very expensive and fancy castles, the most famous one being Neuschwanstein.

It is not clear whether his death by drowning was suicide or whether he was murdered.

Today tourists from all over the world visit the castles that he built. They also visit the Bayreuth Festspielhaus for which he gave a lot of money towards the building.

Ivan Regen

Ivan (Janez) Regen (called Johann Regen) (December 9, 1868 – July 27, 1947), was a Slovenian biologist. He is best known for his studies in bioacoustics, the science of hearing and communicating.

Regen was born in the village of Lajše (now Slovenia). His mother encouraged his interest in insect sounds. His father lost a lot of money bring cloth into Slovenia and could not pay for Ivan to go to school. Ivan was given a scholarship so that he could go to school at the local seminary. He was able to save enough money go to study in Vienna. He studied natural history at the University of Vienna with teachers Grobben, Exner and Claus. He got his doctorate in 1897 and began to work as a school teacher in Vienna, and later in Hranice, Moravia. Exner helped him get a job back in Vienna. He worked in a secondary school there until his retirement in 1918.

Regen began to study insects in great detail. He was one of the first Slovenian scientists to work in another country after World War I. He was the first scientist to study the grasshopper in a lot of detail. He studied katydid and cricket sounds, he proved that insects did react to sounds from each other. He was able to make crickets react to artificial sounds using a loudspeaker. In one experiment, he used a telephone to send sounds from one cricket to another in different rooms. Later, he showed that insects hear with their ear drum. He was the first person to work out what the ear drum does. He is the person who started the study of bioacoustics. He also studied the insects breathing, their hibernation, coloring, and how they shed their skin.

Regen's largest project was his "geobiological laboratory", a large glass cage, called a terrarium. He used this to study the way crickets could find other crickets using sounds; this is called phonotaxis. Using up to 1600 females with normal or damaged hearing, he was able to work out how they did this.

He worked for himself after 1911, but he supported several groups and organizations in Slovenia. He started using Slovene terminology in his areas of study. In 1921, he was asked to be a professor at the University of Ljubljana, but did not take it. In 1940, he became a member of Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts and was also a member of Slovenian Society of Natural History. 

Even though he was a famous scientist known around the world, he was poor and lived alone. His experiments were paid for by the Austrian Academy of Sciences, but he was not allowed to be a member. He did all his work at home. After his death, a lot of his special equipment such as microphones, oscilloscopes, galvanometer, and his written notes were destroyed.

Gun dogs or gundogs, also called bird dogs, are types of dogs used to assist hunters in finding and retrieving game, usually birds. Gundogs are divided into three primary types: retrievers, flushing dogs, and pointing breeds. Flushing dogs flush game from hiding. Pointer dogs point their muzzle towards game to allow the hunter to locate the animal. Retrievers retrieve game once it is killed. Some kennel clubs define a Gundog Group for gundogs, while other kennel clubs include them in the Sporting Group. The three most popular types are: Spaniel, Golden Retriever and Labrador.

The Alaskan Malamute is a breed of domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) originally bred for use as an Alaskan sled dog. They are usually big in size. They are sometimes mistaken for a Siberian Husky, but in fact is quite different in many ways.

"Both breeds have similarities in coat colors and patterns. Both breeds were used for similar activities. The Alaskan Malamute being strong and powerful, was used to transport heavy loads for long distances. The Siberian Husky, being a more of a medium size, was used for pulling lighter loads a shorter distance at a moderate pace." http://www.amrescueohio.com/MalvsHusky.html

Ancyloxypha numitor

The Least Skipper ("Ancyloxypha numitor") is a butterfly in the family Hesperiidae. It is native to North America. They have a weak, bouncy flight.

The Least Skipper has rounded wings and a skinny body. Their antennae are checkered and have no hooks. Male Least Skippers do not have stigmata. [A stigma (plural, stigmata) is a thickening of the wing membrane on the upper side of the top wing]. The upper side of the top wing is dark brown, sometimes having orange on it. The bottom wing is orange with a dark brown border around it. The underside of the wings is bright orange. The bottom wing's veins are a whitish color. Its wingspan (length of the wings) is ¾ to 1 inch.

There are some species of butterflies that are similar to the Least Skipper. They are the European Skipper ("Thymelicus lineola"), the Tropical Least Skipper ("Ancyloxypha arene"), the Orange Skipperling ("Copaeodes aurantiaeca"), and the Southern Skipperling ("Copaeodes minima").

The European Skipper has more pointed wings. It has shorter antennae that are not checkered. Males have very thin, black stigmata on the upper side of the top wing. The upper side of the wings is mostly reddish-orange with thin black borders.

The Tropical Least Skipper has more orange on the upper side. The underside has very small black spots near the edge of the wings.

The Orange Skipperling is almost all bright orange on the upper side. Males have black stigmata on the upper side of the top wing. Females usually have some black on the upper side of the top wing.

The Southern Skipperling is smaller (it is also the smallest skipper in the United States of America). The underside of the bottom wing has a white ray across the width of the wing.

The Least Skipper can be found in damp or wet habitats with tall grasses.

In the northern part of the its range, adults may be seen from May to September. In the southern part of its range, adults can be found from February to December. It may be seen all year in southern Florida.

Males find females by looking for them in tall grasses. Females lay their eggs one at a time on the caterpillar's host plant (the plant that the caterpillar feeds on). The eggs are pale yellow. The caterpillar makes a nest of grass and silk. The caterpillar is green. It has four pairs of white wax glands on the abdomen near the underside. The head is brown or tan. It is usually darker in the center. The collar (the area between where the head and the body connect) has a white stripe and a black stripe. The chrysalis is a cream color and has brown markings. The caterpillar will hibernate in the winter. The Least Skipper has 2-4 broods each year.

Here is a list of host plants that the Least Skipper caterpillar feeds on:

The Vale of White Horse is a local government district of Oxfordshire in England. The main town is Abingdon, other places are Faringdon and Wantage. There are 68 parishes within the district.

It is a region between the Berkshire Downs and the River Thames. It was named after the prehistoric Uffington White Horse. The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972. The area is often referred to as the ‘Vale of the White Horse’.

It is the valley of the Ock, a stream which joins the Thames from the West at Abingdon. The Vale is almost flat and well-wooded. Following local usage the vale covers all the ground between the Cotswolds (on the north) and the White Horse Hills. According to the geographical definition, however, the Vale is from two to five miles wide, and the distance by road from Abingdon to Shrivenham at its head is 18 miles.

The highest hill of the district is White Horse Hill that is 261 m (856 ft) high. In its northern flank, just below the summit, a gigantic figure of a horse is cut, the turf is removed to show the white chalky soil beneath. This figure gives name to the hill, the range and the vale. It is 114 m (374 ft) long, the neck, body and tail varying little in width.

Candidate Statement: I would like to volunteer with Simple Wikipedia in this way. I believe that I am trustworthy enough to not reveal any nonpublic information, as evidenced by my membership with the foundation . I am also a member of the administrators group here on Simple Wikipedia, thus evidenced my local trust here. I am above the age of 18, and am listed on the foundation . I understand the oversight policy and will not act outside that policy. I am available mostly for the answering of oversight requests, so I am active in that regard. () 17:52, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

Q: What experience do you have in identification-restricted roles? How would you decide whether something should be oversighted, as supposed to deleted? 

Q In light of your recent declaration of a wikibreak, do you still intend to pursue this role? – |  04:13, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

Wikipedia:Oversight candidates/Barras

Candidate Statement: Hi! I'm Barras, and I've been an administrator on the Simple English Wikipedia for close to four months. I’m a very active user here on simple. My main work here on simple is to help with vandal fighting, because this is very easy. I have requested several oversight actions here on simple, which were done by a steward. I’ve also got some experience in what needs an oversight action and what not, because I have requested on the German Wikipedia several oversight actions and talked to one of the oversighters, who explained some things to me.

Even though I am not a native speaker of English, I try to do my best and help with article creations and on and . I’ve already written five . I try to help in all areas of this wiki. I participate in discussions and voice my opinion there, even if my English is sometimes not the best.

I know that I am a person with some different points of view and disagree often with other users.

Well, I think I would be a good choice for an oversighter because I am often around on-wiki and also available on IRC. The extra tools would be very helpful for me, because I often help with the recent changes. With the tool I could handle edits which need oversight action very quickly.

If I get elected by our community, I would post my e-mail address on my userpage, to be available (and not only per Wikipedia-mail) to all users.

Further more, I’ve no problems to identify myself to the Wikimedia Foundation.

I hope I can be trusted with the tools. If not, it isn’t the end of the world for me. Regardless of whether or not I am elected, how I help on this wiki will not change.

Thank you for your time! Best -- () 18:13, 26 July 2009 (UTC)


Q: What experience do you have that would make you a stand-out candidate for this role? () 18:14, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

A: Like I mentioned in my self-nom. I requested several oversight actions for this wiki and did this also on dewiki. I also talked to one of the de oversighted, who explained me a few cases. The request oversight action by me on this wiki were all done. I talked also to the stewards about why my request should be done. I think I have now a good understanding, about what needs to be oversighted and what not. Of course, I have not direct experience with this tools, but I am sure I am familar with the oversight policy on meta. I hope I answered you question. Best () 18:19, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

Q: How important do you think oversight is to preserve user's privacy? (ie: if a person was concerned info on their workplace was displayed and connected to their id? and were anxious to delete this)

A: Internet is a very unsecurity place for personal information. The work place of an user is a personal information. If there is a content like ie: "Barras works at xxx" and I've never said this, so it should be oversighted. If this information is public available (ie: per a google search), so it shouldn't be oversighted, but it can be deleted. This would be per our meta oversight policy. Either if I think such informations should be oversighted, even if they can be found on a google search. But this would be against policy. This means, it is a case to case decision. If the posted information in the public available, it should not be oversighted. If the information is not available, if should be oversighted. I hope you understand my anwser.

Candidate Statement: I have a long track record of using tools in an appropriate manner here and on en. I believe I can help support the wiki in this manner as I am used to dealing with sensitive information on a daily basis through my occupation which deals with highly confidential product information at times. I am 18, and will identify myself to the WMF should this succeed. I am available a large chunk of the day so am able to respond quickly to requests. - () 14:04, 27 July 2009 (UTC)

Q:Okay, I'll ask the first question then will I? What makes you think you are a good candidate for this position? What is your experience on-wiki and why should we vote support for you? 20:45, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

A: It's hard to have on-wiki experience for this specific position as there isn't really much equivalent to it. The closest would be vandal reverting of which I obviously do when I see it. I have been known to do a "poor mans oversight" from time to time where I hide the offending edit using the delete and restore method. I have been an admin here for a number of months and a little over a year and a half on en. So it I think that shows I don't abuse tools because I have a wide open track record that anyone can see. I have never been in any drama concerning my use or non-use of tools. As for why you can support me? Because I have common sense. I know what is oversightable and I know how to not disclose confidential information. And that is really the most important part of this particular flag. - () 22:14, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

Candidate Statement: I've been an administrator here for only a couple of months, but I've been an administrator on the English Wikipedia for more than two and a half years. More importantly, I've had Oversight access on en.wiki for more than five months, handling mailing list requests quickly and efficiently due to my day job, which has me by my email pretty much all day. I've already verified my identity with the WMF. I'd like to bring my Oversight experience over to this project as well. // // // 16:23, 27 July 2009 (UTC)

Q: You have various roles on various Wikis, as you've stated. Would you be able to commit enough time to this particular Wikipedia if you were made OS here as well? () 16:48, 27 July 2009 (UTC)

A: Because I'm by my email all day, I can jump on individual reports as they come in (assuming there's a mailing list, similar to the list for en.wiki, or if someone emails me directly) and am usually idling on AIM all day, so I can address oversightable items even if I'm not "checking" the project regularly (ie: looking at my watchlist or RC). Even when I'm less-than-active on enwiki, I still try to take care of Oversight requests if I get to them in time. // // // 17:01, 27 July 2009 (UTC)

Hello there,

On IRC there was a discussion about "managing" our big population of admins a little more. In the context of this discussion, there was the idea of making it very easy for an admin to get the bureaucrat status, after they have been actively involved with this wikipedia for some time. Since it would be easy to get bureaucrat status, it should also be easy to revoke this status on candidates that go inactive.

The current proposal would be:

Details would of course have to be worked out. In my opinion, the time should be long enough that the admins can show their commitment to the community. There were several admins that turned inactive after they were awarded the flag.

Anyway, this is just a short notice; comments are welcome (both ways), so that we can decide if this is a worthwile idea. -- () 21:42, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

Hello. I am editing articles about football. Because I am not good at English, I am sorry if grammar is wrong.

I want you to confirm it. 
Does the Santillana A.D. which 
79.157.57.156 made exist? 
I want you to delete this article if this club does not exist.

In addition, I think that these footballers which 
this user made do not exist.

I think that there is a possibility that most articles and templates that this user made are incorrect articles and templates.

I suggest that we delete all articles and templates that this user made just to make sure.-- () 14:53, 27 July 2009 (UTC)


I propose that we create the first Wikilympics. Its the alternative for the failed WikiCup. It'll follow the same rules of the WikiCup but there will be some difference: IP's are allowed to participate, Two flags for one person will be allowed, more points for each round, add "on this day..." for expansion of it, help for different wikis and uploading pictures. The winner will get a medal. 

For More questions, respond on my talkpage. () 17:59, 28 July 2009 (UTC)

Hey all,

Just wondering what people think about getting a "patroller" right added, that enables those with the flag to mark new pages as patrolled, and also to have their changes automatically patrolled. It was something I frequently did when I had the admin bit, and although I still do it I cannot physically mark the pages as "patrolled".

If no new right was wanted, it could probably be grouped with Rollbacker instead.

Thoughts?

Regards,


(outdent) Maybe I'm not looking in the correct place, but I'm not seeing a backlog of unpatrolled pages. () 21:08, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

Does it cause any harm to the project if we let this happen? If not, why not just go with it. If non-sysops want to have this, why not? 21:19, 18 July 2009 (UTC)


Something to be aware of is that pages marked not patrolled aren't necessarily unpatrolled. Most of us patrol pages and never click the little patrolled button because there is no need to do that on a wiki this small so there never is an actual backlog. We create less than 50 articles a day, almost all of which are looked at by people almost immediately after being seen. There is absolutely no need of this at this wiki. Seems to me this is just a quest to get a different hat since another one was denied. - () 02:17, 19 July 2009 (UTC)

Discussion seems to have stalled on this one. Let's leave behind the petty squabbles above, and re-start the conversation. Feel free to bring the same things up, but I think that would be the best option now that everyone has cooled down a bit. So, do we want the Patroller right enabling or not?
This discussion has stalled, and it seems that there is no consensus to add the right. Could someone remove the right from ? Thanks, () 22:34, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

I have popups enabled here and at enWP, but I have noticed a difference. When I put my cursor over a username here at simple, it does not provide the edit count and user rights, while at enWP it does. Can I change my popups to add that, or does it have to be changed at the project level? () 22:57, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

Discussion is over, Djsasso is a crat. No more overtuning, now let's all get back to editing the encyclopedia.. 02:24, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

Following the closure of the last RfB we had that was contested and afterwards reversed, the current state of our comes to mind. The current version makes no mention of any acceptable range for bureaucrat discretion nor the possibility for the challenging of closures. In addition, based on observations, it appears that editors don't look through comments and the nomination in full before voting. Hence, it might be a good idea to implement what someone suggested quite some time back: a compulsory period in RfXs when no voting is allowed.

All comments are welcome.     11:41, 29 July 2009 (UTC)


That is all I have for now. () 15:39, 29 July 2009 (UTC)


As an aside, when the "close call" stuff has taken place on en.wiki, typically a 'crat will put the RFx on hold and, as NonvocalScream says, initiate a 'crat chat. A 'crat chat would normally precede major 'crat activities such as (1) promoting someone or (2) calling for a steward to demote someone. I think we've messed up on both counts. () 17:42, 29 July 2009 (UTC)





There is some confusion about bureaucrats' abilities. Bureaucrats are part of the community, not above it, so have every right to vote as everyone else. This does "not", however, mean they should be excluded from performing a close where they voted. Just because you voted a particular way, it doesn't mean you are physically unable to close it fairly. We promote bcrats because they can judge consensus in RFAs. If they are unable to do that, just because they happened to vote, they should not be bureaucrats. A bureaucrat closes an RFA based on what the community wants - a bureaucrat is part of the community too. I would trust any of our bureaucrats, whether they closed it or not, to comment in a bureaucrat discussion on this. We are limiting ourselves way too much - I suppose if a bureaucrat even makes a formatting fix on an RFA, that makes them involved too now? It really is getting to silly levels - we need to trust our bureaucrats more. 22:53, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

I propose that Djsasso is given back the crat flag. Fr33kman's close was definitely justified, with it being one vote away from the "recommended" percentage. Fr33kman could've also weighed the arguments in the support and oppose sections. The manner in which the crat flag was removed was entirely inappropriate, and it shouldn't have happened in the first place. I know there will be those meticulous bean counters waving their hands and saying, "the only thing that matters is the percentage", but the reason we give bureaucrats the tools is because we "trust" them to make tough calls like these and not automatically reverse them. For someone who achieved such a large amount of support in his RFB, I'm shocked at how little weight Fr33kman's decision was given. 02:20, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

Our only uninvolved bureaucrat, , has edited 7 time this month, and not in nearly 2 weeks. Since his judgement with RFBs , and he is quite inactive, I'm wondering if it would be OK to go to Meta for the promotion. I'd rather we end this once and for all instead of waiting for Vector. Thoughts? 15:28, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

If a steward should make the decission, it should be a steward, who isn't active on enwiki or admin there, because it could be an COI and we had now enough drama. Please ask an steward, who isn't active on enwiki. Otherwise, it could be an unfair decission. || 16:00, 31 July 2009 (UTC)
Just wondering why Vector is the only uninvolved Crat... 17:12, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

I still don't see the crats discussing anything on this as a chat chat on the talk page of the RFB. I ask...




I propose to enable the ability for our local crats to be able to remove the sysop flag. They close discussions for deRFA, so we should enable them to act on the closure as well. Should this proposal pass, I will make the bug request linking to this discussion. Thoughts? () 01:20, 13 August 2009 (UTC)

A life vest (also called Personal flotation device, lifejacket, or cork jacket) is a special type of clothing. The vest makes people float in water. It also keeps their head out of the water so that they can breathe. There are different categories of life vests. They are mainly different in how much flotation they provide. Some life vests all by themselves, others need to be filled with air manually.

Pocket watch

A pocket watch is a timepiece that is kept in the pocket rather than worn on a wrist. The pocket watch usually has a chain to connect to a certain clothing, so the watch would not fall out of the pocket and get broken. This watch was popular before the wristwatch came. Because of wristwatches, the pocket watch became less common and popular. Still, some people today wear pocket watches, and a golden pocket watch is often a token of a person's retirement.
It is thought to be invented by Peter Henlein.

Developing country

Different people have tried to classify countries into different groups. This is usually done either by looking at how rich people are, on average in different countries, or how well-developed the political system is. Most of the time, there are two groups, namely developing countries and developed ones. Sometimes there are three groups. The third group is usually called emerging countries, and is between developing and developed countries.

These definitions are problematic, because a high standard of living doesn't just mean that people make a lot of money. The main problem is that things cost different amounts in different countries. Just because people earn more money in one country does not necessarily mean they are better-off; they might earn more simply because the cost of living is higher. This means they need to spend more money just to buy those things they need every day.

For this reason, there are different definitions of developing countries. The level of development also changes a lot from one developing countries to another. There are developing countries that have a high standard of living.

Malden Island

Malden Island is an island in the Pacific Ocean. Today, the island belongs to Kiribati. It is one of the Line Islands. In the 19th century the island used to be called Independence Island at times. The island is uninhabited today, it has been made into a nature reserve for breeding seabirds.

Malden Island is located 242 nautical miles (nmi) south of the equator, 150 nmi south of Honolulu, Hawaii. The coast of South America is more than 4,000 nautical miles (5,000 statute miles or 8,000 km) to the east.

The nearest land is uninhabited Starbuck Island, 110 nmi to the southwest. The closest inhabited place is Tongareva (Penrhyn Island),243 nmi to the southwest. The nearest airport is on Kiritimati (Christmas Island), 365 nmi to the northwest. There are other uninhabited islands nearby. They include Jarvis Island, 373 nmi to the northwest, Vostok Island, 385 nmi to the south-southeast, and Caroline (Millennium) Island, 460 nmi to the southeast.

The island has roughly the shape of an equilateral triangle, with on a side, aligned with the southwest side running northwest to southeast. The west and south corners are slightly truncated, shortening the north, east and southwest coasts to about , and adding shorter west and south coasts about 1 to 2 km (–1 mi) in length. 

There is a large lagoon with many small islets in the east-central part of the island. The lagoon is completely sourrounded by land. It is connected to the sea by underground channels, and is quite salty. Most of the land area of the island lies to the south and west of the lagoon. The total area of the island is about 39.2 square kilometers. 

The island is very low, no more than above sea level at its highest point. The highest elevations are found along a rim that closely follows the coastline. The inside forms a depression that is only a few meters above sea level in the western part and is below sea level (filled by the lagoon) in the east central part. Because of this topography, the ocean cannot be seen from much of Malden's interior.

There is no standing fresh water on Malden Island, though a fresh water lens may exist.

A continuous heavy surf falls all along the coast, forming a narrow white to gray sandy beach. On the west coast, the white sandy beach is bigger. On the rest of the coast there is a strip of dark gray coral rubble, forming a ridge. This makes the beach itself smaller.

George Anson Byron, a British captain, discovered Malden Island on 30 July 1824. He named it after Charles Robert Malden who was the first to land on the island. At the time of its discovery, the island was uninhabited, but there were ruins. Archeologists discovered that the island was inhabited by between 100 and 200 Polynesians, a few centuries earlier. 

The ancient stone structures are located around the beach ridges. Most of them are on the north and south sides. Overall, twenty-one sites are known. Three of them are larger than the others. They can be found on the northwest side of the island. The sites are either temples, houses or graves. The temple ruins are referred to as marae. Similar marae have also been found on other islands, such as Raivavae, one of the Austral Islands.

The inhabitants had also made wells, but later settlers found them to be dry, or too salty.

In 1828, guano was discovered on the island. In 1856, the United States wanted to get the Island, but Australian firms had already started to mine the guano deposits. Guano mining stopped about 1927. In 1956 and 1957, Great Britain tested H-bombs on the island. The tests were called Operation Grapple.

Closing bureaucrat's comments: This RFB was a close call, probably the closest in recent history. The support comments are just that, supports and they are all positively in favour of promotion. There were basically 6 editors who were not in support of promotion and these can be grouped into three different positions; 1) too many crats already, 2) too aggressive and confrontational an attitude and 3) lack of understanding of consensus in the RfX process. Diffs were requested to show examples of confrontaion in the candidates dealings with others but were not really forthcoming apart from a single example which can be taken differntly by different readers. Whilst no comments have been discounted those of the nature of "too many crats" have not been taken as an objection of the candidates ability to be a crat and have thus been weighed in that light. I feel this RFB falls within the descretion of a bureaucrat as taking all the preceeding into account it is very close to call. The oppose comments that have had the most influence on the closing of this RFB are numbers 2 and 3 above. These have come from two editors and I feel that whilst they should be an area of improvement by the candidate in the future, they do not overcome the support given by the other members of the community. I have therefore decided to exercise discretion and promote the candidate to bureaucrat. I hope the community respects my reasoning. 04:25, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

I've been observing Djsasso for a bit, most especially s/his judgement. I believe s/he would make an excellent addition to our crat team here. Thank you for your consideration. Has clue... that is all I ask of crats... is clue. () 04:09, 22 July 2009 (UTC)<br><br>

"End date: " 04:25, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

"Candidate's acceptance:" I had to think about this one. I went down in a blaze of glory last time I had an Rfb. I am sure I will get plenty of there are too many 'Crats comments especially after the recent promotion of fr33kman, and that is ok because everyone use entitled to their opinion so you won't hear boo from me if that is your reason. But anyways as for why I am accepting it, I am accepting it because I am always willing to help the wiki in any capacity I am capable of. A few extra buttons will allow me to help in some new ways, renaming (which I notice a few have sat for quite a while recently) or bot approvals etc. Is there a pressing need for me to have these tools with all the other crats, no there probably is not, but that doesn't mean having an extra person around can't help. I think my record with my admin tools shows I won't abuse any tools. And I like to think that I show that I have clue as NVS mentions above. I have also tried to fix some issues that were raised at my last Rfb about needing to have a more open mind about things like IRC, and as the regulars on there will see I am on there all the time now, I still push to make sure decisions leave a paper trail on wiki, but I see no problem on people using off-wiki tools for community building. So have at me and give me your worst. - () 04:24, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

Wikipedia:Oversight candidates/Peterdownunder

Candidate Statement: I have been working on this wiki for over a year. I have been an administrator for quite a while. I have written a lot of articles, expanded lots of stubs, added lots of pictures, simplified lots of articles and fixed lots of categories (over 6000 total edits). My goal is to make this a really good encyclopedia. As one of the older people involved in the project I think I have the maturity and wisdom (I hope I do!) to be a very responsible Oversighter. -- () 12:28, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

Q: You say you think you'd be a "very responsible Oversighter". Can you explain why? I understand you're good with articles, categories etc, but Oversight is very, very different. What relevant experience do you have? () 12:41, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

A: I have relevant experience in several of the key areas of oversight. Firstly protecting the privacy of individuals. In part of my current job I have to deal with special needs students. This gives me access to quite detailed confidential reports and assessments. There are strict privacy laws operating in Australia which control how such info is stored, who and when people can have access to it. For example, sometimes I have to provide information as part of a court hearing, and this requires me to remove the names on reports or other identifying information, where they are not relevant to the case. I am able to understand and comply with this privacy legislation on a daily basis. I believe that the SEWP needs to be vigilant in order to protect a person's privacy and take I this matter very seriously.

Secondly on removing libellous information. I have deleted this several times in my role as an administrator when I have found it. In order to keep the wiki community running smoothly there is no place for this kind of material. It needs to be deleted promptly as it does the wiki no credit and only harms its reputation to leave it in place. It is very important for a credible encyclopedia to have a neutral style, so I believe in quickly removing anything that can be seen to have lack a neutral POV and/or makes critical and unsubstantiated claims about anyone. I am happy to take legal or other advice about such material, and the community could expect both considered and decisive action from me.

Thirdly on copyright. I take copyright very seriously as people may remember from my arguments in the recent debate about allowing fair-use images not supported by the Wikimedia commons. I am a published author who has written several books on naval history, Australian political history, and music. Copies of these are included in the National Library of Australia's collection. I have also written a number of plays and musicals. I take my copyright very seriously and would not hesitate to take action if my rights were being infringed. As part of my current job, I am responsible for school music programs across about 25% of regional Victoria (Australia). This means I have had proper training in copyright law so that I am able to advise teachers on their legal obligations under the copyright laws. Copyright is an issue that has to be dealt with, and not to be avoided or ignored. I have been keeping a close watch on the current debate on the Wikimedia commons about fair use of reproduced images of art works held in art galleries. I don't see any place for copyright violations on this wikipedia and would not hesitate to remove them as soon as possible () 08:31, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

Q
what do you feel is the main quality one should have to deal with "oversight" requests ?
17:37, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

A The main quality a person needs to do this job is to be able to remain calm and rational, carefully consider the evidence, and then take prompt and decisive action. I believe that I have these qualities. As well, I am able to work together with other editors, and have done so on several projects. I need to be available - the SEWP is my main wiki, I do add images to the Wikimedia Commons, and sometimes have edited on the Simple English Wiktionary, but I am usually editing here most days of the week. I can be reached quickly by email or on IRC. () 08:31, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

<doc id="193083" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193083" title="York Minster">
York Minster

York Minster is the largest Gothic cathedral in Northern Europe. The title "Minster" is given to churches which in the Anglo-Saxon period were missionary teaching churches. 

York Minster is in the city of York, Yorkshire, north-east England. It is the 'seat' of the Archbishop of York, the second-ranked religious official of the Church of England. The Minster is run by a Chapter (committee) under the Dean of York, who manages the affairs of the Minster. 

The architecture of the Minster is English Gothic architecture, from Early English in 1270 to Perpendicular in 1472. The Minster has a wide, Decorated Gothic nave (where the congregation sits) and Chapter house. The choir (spelled 'quire' by the church) is slightly later English Gothic architecture. The east end, and north and south transepts are in a similar style. The nave contains the West Window, constructed in 1338. 

Some of the stained glass in York Minster dates back to the twelfth century. Over the Lady Chapel in the east end is the Great East Window (finished in 1408), the largest area of mediaeval stained glass in the world. The window is known to be the work of John Thornton of Coventry a master glazier and stained glass artist who was active in England during the first half of the 15th century. 

In the north transept is the Five Sisters Window, each narrow window being over high. The south transept contains the famous Rose window.
About 2 million individual pieces of glass make up the cathedral's 128 stained glass windows. Much of the glass was removed before and pieced back together after the First and Second World Wars, and the windows are constantly being cleaned and restored to keep their beauty intact.

A total of seven clock bells, 14 change ringing bells and 22 carillon bells are lodged in the towers. The carillon bells are played on a baton keyboard in the ringing chamber. The largest bell is Great Peter, which strikes the hour. It weighs 10.8 tons.

York has had a Christian presence from the 300s. The first church on the site was a wooden structure built hurriedly in 627 to provide a place to baptise Edwin, King of Northumbria. A stone building was completed in 637, and was dedicated to Saint Peter. Its school and library were started in the 7th century.

In 741 the church was destroyed in a fire. It was rebuilt as a bigger building, with thirty altars. The church and the entire area then passed through the hands of Norse invaders. The Benedictine archbishop Ealdred travelled to Westminster to crown William in 1066. Ealdred died in 1069 and was buried in the church.

The church was damaged in 1069, but the first Norman archbishop, arriving in 1070, organised repairs. The Danes destroyed the church in 1075, but it was again rebuilt from 1080. Built in the Norman style, it was 111 m (364.173 ft) long. The new structure was damaged by fire in 1137 but was soon repaired. The choir and crypt were remodelled in 1154, and a new chapel was built, all in the Norman style.

The Gothic style in cathedrals had arrived in the mid 12th century. Walter de Gray was made archbishop in 1215 and ordered the construction of a Gothic structure to compare with Canterbury; building began in 1220. The cathedral was declared complete and consecrated in 1472.

The English Reformation led to the first Anglican archbishop. Some of the cathedral's treasures were taken by the Crown, and the church lost some of its land. Under Elizabeth I there was an effort to remove all traces of the Roman Catholic Church from the cathedral; there was much destruction of tombs, windows, and altars. In the English Civil War the city was besieged and fell to the forces of Cromwell in 1644, but Thomas Fairfax prevented any further damage to the cathedral.

<doc id="193205" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193205" title="Grapeshot">
Grapeshot

Grape shot is a hollow ball, packed with small "grape" sized metal balls which can be fired by a gun or a cannon. The hollow balls are fired as a single round that breaks apart upon leaving the muzzle of a black powder cannon, which were common common to the 1700 and 1800's. Grape shot is quite different from a shell or shrapnel rounds.

A shell is a hollow ball packed with explosive and a fuse. The fuse is lit by the explosive charge that sends the shell towards its target. It is designed to explode when it reaches its target. Grape shot begins to spread as soon as it leaves the gun or cannon. Shrapnel, while similar to both, is different and more deadly. Invented by a British officer during the Napoleonic Wars, it is a fused explosive shell filled with many small balls or iron/lead bits. When the shell bursts the small bits scatter in a more or less spherical pattern with usually fatal force. 

All three of these rounds, grape shot, shell, and shrapnel, are extremely effective against troops, horses and other livestock. They can also destroy wooden structures from their intense fragmentation impact. Shells have historically been particularly effective as incendiaries against wooden targets, which they ignite from the heat of their explosive blast. Grape shot sends out mini-missiles across a wide pattern. This is best for people targets, but it may be quite damaging against nearby wooden structures.

Banzai charge

A Banzai charge (or ""banzai" attack") (萬歳突撃) was a tactic used by Japanese soldiers against American soldiers when they were losing World War II. Banzai charges were usually suicide charges.

Pikachu

Pikachu is a yellow mouse from the fictional Pokémon world that was created by Satoshi Tajiri. It can attack using electricity which comes from red pouches on its cheeks. It can evolve into Raichu, which is bigger and stronger. A smaller and weaker Pokémon called Pichu can evolve into Pikachu. Pikachu appears in most Pokémon games in some way.

Pikachu is the best known of all Pokémon because it is the official mascot of the series. It is also one of the main characters of the Pokémon anime and comic books. In one of the first Pokémon games, "Pokémon Yellow", it is the player's starter Pokémon.
In the "Pokémon" TV series, the trainer Ash Ketchum's first Pokémon is a Pikachu. At first it does not like him, but then he saves it from some Spearow and their friendship grows slowly from there.

Pikachu has also appeared in "Super Smash Bros.," "Super Smash Bros. Melee", and "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" as a very fast and light playable character.

Pichu is the pre-evolved form of Pikachu. It is a small yellow electric mouse, but does not have as much power as a Pikachu. It evolves to Pikachu when it is very happy. There are special forms of Pichu; a notched ear Pichu, and a Pikachu-colored Pichu as event Pokémon in the "Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver" games. Pichu has appeared in "Super Smash Bros. Melee", as a very light and fast playable character. Pichu features in the intro of the third Pokémon movie.

Raichu is the evolved form of Pikachu and has orange fur, unlike Pikachu's yellow fur. In order for a Pikachu to evolve into a Raichu, it must use a Thunderstone. It can hold much more electricity in its cheeks. In the Pokémon anime, Gym Leader Lt. Surge's Raichu has a battle with Ash's Pikachu. At first Raichu wins, but Pikachu beats it in a rematch.

Cypress Gardens

Cypress Gardens is a theme park near Winter Haven, Florida in the United States.

Cypress Gardens opened on January 2, 1936 as a flower garden planted by Dick and Julie Pope. Over the years, it became one of the biggest attractions in Florida, known for its water ski shows, nice gardens, and Southern Belle models.

It became known as the "Water Ski Capital of the World" because many of the sport's major "firsts" and over 50 world records were broken there. Many movies have been filmed at the park, including parts of "This is Cinerama," the first feature filmed in that wide-screen format, and several of Esther Williams films and TV specials in the 1950s and 1960s. With their addition of a custom photography boat named Miss Cover Girl in the early 1960s, the park became a popular site for the filming of television commercials.

Competition for guests increased after the Walt Disney World Resort opened nearby in 1971. In the early 1980s, the Popes retired and gave the park to their son, Dick Pope Jr.

In the 1980s, book publisher Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich bought the park along with SeaWorld, Circus World (later rebuilt as Boardwalk & Baseball) and Stars Hall of Fame, but sold most of the businesses to Anheuser-Busch in 1989. Busch continued to run Cypress Gardens until April 1, 1995, when a group of the park's managers led by Bill Reynolds bought the property.

Under President and CEO Reynolds, the park ran until April 13, 2003, when it closed after a long tourism decline following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. 529 people were put out of work with only three days notice. 

Right away the Friends of Cypress Gardens, started and led by Burma Davis Posey, was founded. They enrolled members in all 50 states and 27 countries. Within three and a half months, this grass-roots effort raised $13,500,000 and saved the park.

On February 22, 2004, Adventure Parks Group, owned by Kent Buescher, bought the property and renamed it Cypress Gardens Adventure Park. The purchase of the amusement park portion of the Cypress Gardens property was part of a larger conservation agreement. In that agreement, the entire site was bought from its previous owner, First Gardens, L.C., by The Trust for Public Land, a nation wide conservation group . TPL then sold a conservation access over the entire property to the state of Florida, while Polk County purchased the gardens portion of the property, less the development rights conveyed in the state agreement. Adventure Parks Group purchased the balance of the property, also subject to the conservation agreement.

Buescher's plan to reopen the park in September 2004 was delayed by damages created by hurricanes Charley, Frances, and Jeanne. Cypress Gardens Adventure Park finally opened in November 2004. One of its new rides, the Triple Hurricane roller coaster, was named for the fierce storm season. The Splash Island water park opened in 2005, along with the Galaxy Spin roller coaster.

In September 2006, Adventure Parks Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the Florida site following approximately $30 million in damages sustained by the 2004 hurricanes.

Land South Adventures, a branch of Mulberry, Florida-based Land South Holdings, bought Cypress Gardens at a bankruptcy auction on October 16, 2007 for $16.9 million, leaving Buescher as temporary manager until Baker Leisure Group of Orlando, Florida took over running the park in January 2008.

Many celebrities have skied and visited at the park, including Elvis Presley, Jordan's former King Hussein and his son, King Abdullah II. It was also the site of a Johnny Carson special.

On Monday, November 10, 2008, Land South Holdings announced the temporary closure of the park, which was shut down November 17 of that year. It reopened on March 28, 2009 with an expanded water park, named Splash Island. The rides and animals, however, were gone. The reopening prices were reduced. Cypress Gardens and Splash Island now have separate ticketing, though seasonal passes are available. Parking is now free.

Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion

The Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion is a musical composition by the Hungarian composer Béla Bartók. It was written for a very unusual combination of players. Four players are needed to perform this sonata: two pianists and two percussion players. The two pianists each have a piano, and the two percussion players play seven instruments between them: three timpani, xylophone, one side drum with snares and one without, a suspended cymbal, a pair of cymbals, a bass drum, a triangle and a tam-tam.

In the introduction to the score Bartók gave very precise instructions about how the different percussion instruments should be played, the kinds of beaters to be used, and a plan of how they were to be grouped on stage.

There are three movements: a fast movement, a slow movement and a fast movement. The first movement starts with a slow introduction.

There are many interesting and unusual things to listen out for in the music. For example, in the first movement the timpani sometimes play glissandos. This means that the pitch of the notes slides up or down. The player needs to have timpani with pedals to do this. This movement is in sonata form.

The second movement sounds very creepy. Bartók quite often wrote music which sounded like insects at night. This is one of his “night pieces”. In the climax to this exciting music Piano One plays lots of glissandos.

The last movement is a big contrast to the atmosphere in the slow movement. It is like a lively dance.

The sonata was first performed in Basle in 1938 with the composer playing one piano and his wife Ditta playing the other one. Fritz Schiesser and Philipp Rühlig played the percussion. It immediately became very popular and has since been one of his best- known works. Bartók also made a version for the two pianos to play with an orchestra, but it is not normally performed like that.

Concerto for Orchestra (Bartók)

Concerto for Orchestra is the title of a work for orchestra by the Hungarian composer Béla Bartók. It is one of the most famous orchestral pieces of the mid-20th century.

Several composers have written works to which they gave the title “Concerto for Orchestra”. It is an unusual title because a concerto is normally a work for one solo instrument and an orchestra. The soloist is given a lot of opportunity to show off his (or her) talent. In a “Concerto for Orchestra” there is no soloist, but the composer thinks it is different from a symphony because a lot of the instruments in the orchestra are treated like soloists during the piece. This is what happens in Béla Bartók’s concerto.

The work was written in 1943 and it was first performed on 1 December 1944 in the Boston Symphony Hall by the Boston Symphony Orchestra with the conductor Serge Koussevitzky. It was immediately a great success. Koussevitszky asked Bartók to write this piece. Bartók had just arrived in United States from Hungary. He had to flee because of the World War II. Bartók had no money and so he was glad to get some work.

Bartók often uses ideas from the Classical music period in this work. He also uses ideas from folk music from central Europe, especially Hungarian music. Quite often the music is not in a major or minor key. He uses folk scales which have different kinds of scales called modes. Sometimes tunes sound like folk music. At other times there are drones in the horns and strings.
The orchestra needs 3 flutes (one doubling piccolo), 3 oboes (one doubling cor anglais), 3 clarinets (one doubling bass clarinet), 3 bassoons (one doubling contrabassoon), 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, side drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, tamtam, 2 harps and strings

The first movement, called "Introduzione" by Bartók, is a slow introduction which sounds like music describing the night. This is something Bartók did several times in his works. It is in sonata form.

The second movement is called "Giuoco delle coppie" which means "Game of pairs". Pairs of instruments take it in turns to play a tune, each pair playing music which is separated by a different interval. 

The third movement, called "Elegia" by Bartók, is another slow movement, typical of Bartók's night music.

The fourth movement, called "Intermezzo interrotto" by Bartók, has a flowing melody with a time signature which keeps changing. There is also a theme which pokes fun at the march tune in Dmitri Shostakovich's ""Leningrad" Symphony (No. 7)". There is a very difficult bit for the timpani where the player has to play lots of different pitches in a very short section.

The fifth movement, called "Finale" is a very fast movement with lots of energy and plenty of folk tunes.

Bluebird K7

Bluebird K7 is a boat built for Donald Campbell to break the World Water Speed Record. Bluebird was a special kind of boat, called a hydroplane, that skims over the top of the water instead of pushing through it like a normal boat. Bluebird was powered by a jet engine. It set new world water speed records seven times; the fastest was 276 mph (445 km/h). Bluebird was destroyed when Campbell tried to set an eighth record by going faster than 300 mph (480 km/h) on Coniston Water in 1967.

Campbell had been using his father's boat, Bluebird K4, to try and set new records. Bluebird K4 was destroyed when its structure broke. After this, Donald had the idea for a jet powered hydroplane to take the world water speed record from the American propeller hydroplane Slo-mo-shun. Ken and Lewis Norris designed and built K7 based on Donald's ideas.

K7 was a three point hydroplane, meaning that when going quickly the boat only touched the water in three places, one point near the back of the boat and one point at the back of the two sponsons (the sponsons are the floats either side of the boat, near its front in the photos). It was built of aluminium on top of a steel frame and was at first powered by a small turbojet. 

The name K7 came from the rating given to the boat by Lloyds of London

Campbell set seven world water speed records in K7 between 1955 and 1964:


In 1966, Campbell decided he wanted to make Bluebird go faster than 300 mph (480 km/h). 

Bluebird's old engine was not strong enough to make it go this fast, so it was replaced with a more powerful Bristol Siddeley Orpheus engine taken from an old fighter jet. Many other changes were made, the tail fin from the fighter was attached to Bluebird's rear, the cover over the cockpit was changed to push through the air more easily, and the floats at the front were also changed. Bluebird was taken to Coniston Water to be tested in 1966. The tests did not go well, the weather was too bad to test the boat while moving, so it was tied down and tested without moving instead. When testing the engine it sucked in too much air and caused parts of the boat to break. The engine was broken when the broken parts were sucked into it. This meant that the entire engine had to be replaced. 

At the end of November the weather was good enough for some test runs, but the speed was a lot lower than Bluebird's old records. The fuel pumps couldn't pump enough fuel to the engine so it couldn't run at full speed. The problem was fixed by fitting two fuel pumps instead of one. 

On 4 January 1967, the problems had all been fixed, the weather was good and Campbell decided he wanted to try and break the speed record. For a world record to be official, a boat trying to set a record has to make two runs at full speed that are timed by people who are not part of the record breaking team. The official speed is the average speed of the two runs. On the first run Bluebird's speed was 297.6 mph (478.9 km/h) which was fast enough to be a new record, but not quite as fast as Campbell wanted to go. To set a record of more than 300 mph the second run would have to be 302.5 mph or faster. 

The plan for the world record attempt was for Bluebird to stop at the far end of the lake and refuel from another boat that had been put there for that purpose. Taking time to refuel would also give the lake, which had been disturbed by the first run, time to settle down again. On the actual record attempt, Campbell decided not to refuel and instead started on his second run straight away. Why he did this is unknown. 

At the start of the second run, Bluebird was going faster than 320 mph (510 km/h) and would have easily broken the 300 mph target, but as the boat travelled along the lake it started tramping (which means rocking from side to side). Bluebird hit a wave made on the lake from its own first run and the boat spun out of the water. When it hit the water again it broke into pieces and sank. Donald Campbell was killed in the crash. His teddy bear mascot was found floating in the lake later on but Campbell's body could not be found.

In 2001 a diver called Bill Smith led a salvage team which found Bluebird on the bottom of Coniston Water, and later lifted the wreck back to dry land. The wreck was taken apart carefully to keep it from rusting and is now being put back together again. There was a lot of damage caused in the crash but it can all be repaired. Bill Smith also got a new engine for Bluebird and hopes to return the boat to full working order. 

In 2009 Bill Smith got permission to run Bluebird on Coniston at high speed to prove that it has been fixed properly. This will happen when his team has finished putting the boat back together again. 

Donald Campbell's body was also found in 2001. He was buried on 12th September 2001 in Coniston cemetery.

The Telamiina 65 77 (Track mine model 66, with detonator model 77) is a Finnish Army standard issue anti-tank mine. The mine is made of 9.5 kg (~21 lbs) of cast TNT. The mine is armed with a detonator that is set to explode when at least 100 kg (~220 lbs) of pressure is applied to it. The blast effect of the mine blows the track off of tanks and damages their driving wheel.

The mine is also known as the "Kuntonappi" ("Fitness pill") or the "Tellu" (female name, shortened form of Tellervo9).

After Tim quit to start a new band called Rise Against, he was replaced in 1999 by Christopher Gutierrez. Gutierrez is now a touring author and spoken word artist. He was replaced as the bass guitar player for one tour by Joseph Trohman (now plays guitar in the band Fall Out Boy). Trohman was not a good fit for the band in terms of knowing about the music style and in terms of stage presence. He was replaced mid-tour when the band flew Chris Gutierrez out to New York for the final half of their tour, including a stop at CBGB's. 

In the last Arma Angelus concert, Patrick Stump played drums, Pete Wentz sang, Joe Trohman played guitar along with Adam Bishop, and Christopher Gutierrez on bass.

51 Pegasi is a star that is like our Sun and can be found 15.4 parsecs (50.1 light-years) away from the Earth in the constellation Pegasus. It was the first Sun-like star, other than the Sun, found to have a planet orbiting it, this discovery was first made public in 1995.

The exoplanet's discovery was made public on October 6, 1995 by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz. The discovery was made using the radial velocity method at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, using a tool called the ELODIE spectrograph that is used to find planets that are outside our Solar System. 

The star itself has an apparent brightness of 5.49, and because of this it is able to be seen from the Earth with binoculars, or with the naked eye if it is dark outside. 51 Pegasi is a yellow dwarf star that is thought to be around 7.5 billion years old, which is somewhat older than our Sun. 51 Pegasi is also 4-6% more massive than our Sun with more metal content. However, it is running low on hydrogen. 

In 1996 astronomers Baliunas, Sokoloff, and Soon calculated that it takes 51 Pegasi b 37 days to orbit 51 Pegasi.

After the announcement, on October 12, 1995, more proof that this star did exist came from Dr. Geoffrey Marcy from San Francisco State University and Dr. R. Paul Butler from the University of California, Berkeley using the Hamilton Spectrograph at the Lick Observatory near San Jose in California.

51 Pegasi b is the first discovered planet of its parent star, 51 Pegasi. If any more are discovered they will be named 51 Pegasi c, 51 Pegasi d, and so on. The planet has been informally named Bellerophon. After its discovery, many teams proved its existence and continued to find out more about its properties, including the fact that it orbits very close to the star, has estimated temperatures around 1200 Celsius, and has a minimum mass about half that of Jupiter.

Gumbasia is a very short movie made in 1953 by Art Clokey. "Gumbasia" was a clay animation movie. Clokey became famous for his two series Gumby and Davy and Goliath which also used clay animation.

Clokey made "Gumbasia" while he was studying at the University of Southern California and being taught by Slavko Vorkapich. It was Clokey's first clay animation movie and it was only 3 minutes and 45 seconds long. The movie showed moving lumps of clay set to music in a copy of Walt Disney's "Fantasia". Gumbasia was made in a style Vorkapich taught called Kinesthetic Film Principles. This style, which uses camera movements and stop-motion editing, is used in later Gumby movies. After watching "Gumbasia", movie producer Sam Engel decided to give Clokey money to make a 15 minute movie that became the first Gumby movie -- "Gumby Goes to the Moon".

The Joker is a fictional character, a comic book supervillain published by DC Comics. He is an archenemy of Batman. Created by Jerry Robinson, Bill Finger and Bob Kane, the character first appeared in Batman #1 (Spring 1940).

Throughout his comic book appearances, the Joker is portrayed as a master criminal whose characterization has varied from that of a violent psychopath to a goofy trickster-thief. He is the archenemy of Batman, having been directly responsible for numerous tragedies in Batman's life, including the paralysis of Barbara Gordon and the death of Jason Todd, the second Robin.

Throughout the character's long history, there have been several different origin tales; they most commonly depict him as falling into a vat of chemical waste, which bleaches his skin and turns his hair green and his lips bright red, giving him the appearance of a clown.

70 Virginis b is an extrasolar planet that is around 60 light-years away from the Earth in the constellation of Virgo. The finding of this planet was announced in 1996 by astronomers Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler. 70 Virginis was one of the first stars that was known to have planets orbiting it. When first announced, 70 Virginis b was thought to be inside its star's habitable zone, but proof was later found that the planet has an eccentric orbit, closer to its parent.

70 Virginis b is a Jupiter-type extrasolar planet that orbits around 70 Virginis every 116 days. It has 7.5 times the mass of Jupiter. Its surface gravity is thought to be about two to three times that of Jupiter's. At the time that it was found in January 1996, it was thought that the star was only 29 light years away from the Earth. This could explain why the star was less bright based on its apparent magnitude (measure of brightness). As a result the planet's orbit was thought to be in the habitable zone and the planet was given the nickname "Goldilocks" (not too cold or too hot). The Hipparcos satellite later showed that the star was farther away from 70 Virginis and therefore its brightness was a result of the planet being too hot to be in the habitable zone.

Scholasticism

Scholasticism is a way of thinking and teaching knowledge. It was developed in the Middle Ages. It started when people wanted to bring together what is called "classical philosophy" with the teachings of 
Christian theology. Classical philosophy is the philosophy developed in Ancient Greece. 
Scholasticism is not a philosophy or a theology, but rather a way of teaching and learning. Scholasticism emphasises dialectical reasoning. The main purpose of Scholasticism is to find an answer to a question, or to show that a contradiction can be resolved. 

Scholasticism was started by people like St. Ambrose and St. Augustine. They tried to use philosophy to help explain the doctrine and mysteries of the church. Ambrose and Augustine were among the first Church fathers 
who brought Christian ideas and Greek philosophy together. 

The main figures of scholasticism were Peter Abelard, Albertus Magnus, Duns Scotus, William of Ockham, Bonaventure and, most importantly, Thomas Aquinas. Summa Theologica is an ambitious synthesis of Greek philosophy and Christian doctrine. In the 13th century, the teachings of Aristotle were considered more important than those of Plato. With this change, science as a whole started to change. Beforehand it used deductive and "a priori" reasoning. Modern science uses inductive resoning ("a posterori").

916 America

</div>

916 America is a minor planet that is orbiting the Sun in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter.

It was discovered on 7 August 1915 by the Soviet astronomer Grigory Nikolaevich Neujmin at Simeis, Ukraine. It was originally called 916I, but was renamed "916 America" on 24 February 1923 after the Council of Astronomers at Pulkovo Observatory decided to pay tribute to "the friendly relations of the astronomical observatories and astronomers". Another possible reason for the name was as a mark of thankfulness for the help given during the famine in Crimea by the American Relief Administration under President Herbert Hoover.

In 1986, believing that the asteroid was of S-type and that it had a diameter of 15 km, the length of 916 America's day was thought to be 38 hours. Observations by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite have since shown that it has a diameter of 33.2±1.3 km, with an absolute magnitude of 11.20 and an albedo (the extent to which it reflects light) of 0.053±0.004.

Diomede Islands

The Diomede Islands are two islands in the Bering Stait, about halfway between mainland Alaska and Siberia. There are also called Gvozdev Islands in Russian. There are two islands, called "Big Diomede". and "Little Diomede" respectively. Little Diomede is also known as Krusenstern Island, but there are also other places with this name. The Eskimos who live there call it "Ignaluk". 

The other island, Big Diomede is also known as Imaqliq, Inaliq, Nunarbuk or Ratmanov Island. 

Big Diomede belongs to Siberia, Little Diomede is part of Alaska.

They Chukchi Sea is to the north and the Bering Sea to the south of the islands. to the southeast is Fairway Rock, an islet which is usually not considered part of the Diomede Islands.

The islands are separated by an international border and the International Date Line which is approximately from each island. At the closest distance between Little Diomede and Big Diomede, the two islands are only about apart. 

People who live on Little Diomede Island do so in a small village called Diomede, on the west side of the island.

There are plans to build a connection between Siberia and Alaska, either as a bridge or a tunnel (Bering Strait bridge spanning the Bering Strait). In that case, the Diomede Island would be a halfway point, as they are about the middle of the Bering Strait.

They are sometimes called Tomorrow Island (Big Diomede) and Yesterday Isle (Little Diomede) because the big island is 21 hours ahead of the small one (except when changing daylight saving time, done on different dates).

The people who lived on Big Diomede Island were moved to mainland Russia by the Soviet government. A small Russian military base is currently on the island. Little Diomede has an Inupiat Eskimo population of 170, mostly in the City of Diomede. This village there has a school, and a local store. Some eskimos there are famous for their ivory carving. Mail is delivered by helicopter, weather permitting.

Clay animation

Clay animation is one of many ways to make a stop motion animation. Each animated piece, either character or background, can be formed and reformed into different shapes. People making a clay animation usually use something soft, like Plasticine clay. 

Most animation is made the same way, whether it is cel animation or stop motion. Each frame, or still picture, is recorded on film or digital media and then played back quickly. When played back at a frame rate of more than 10–12 frames per second, the human mind sees the series of slightly changing, rapidly playing images as movement. To us it seems as if the object is moving by itself. This way of tricking the mind into seeing "movement" is the way that all moving images work, from zoetrope to movies to videogames. The way CGI animations are made is different from the frame by frame method.

In clay animation, each object is made in clay, usually around a wire skeleton called an armature. The object is put on the set (background) and a still picture (one frame of film) is taken. The object or character is then moved slightly by hand. Another picture is taken, and the object is moved slightly again. This is repeated over and over. To get the best results, special care is taken to make sure that each frame is the same as the one before. For example, the lighting has to be the same and the object has to be put back in exactly the right place. The only thing that should be different is the slight change the animator makes to the object.

Making a stop-motion animation using clay is hard work. Normal movies use 24 frames per second (frame/s). Animation usually uses "doubles" or "twos"; that is using two frames for each shot. This means that 12 changes are made for one second of movie. For a 30-minute movie, there would be about 21,600 stops to change the objects for the next frame. For a full-length (90-minute) movie, there would be about 64,800 stops. IF some of the parts were done with only a single, not double frame, there would be even more stops. Great care must be taken to make sure that the object is not moved by accident. For full-length movies, animators now use rubber silicone and resin-cast objects. One foam-rubber method has been called "Foamation" by Will Vinton.

Some famous clay animation movies have been made. Examples include:

The word "Claymation" is a registered trademark in the United States. It was registered by Will Vinton in 1978 to describe his clay animation films. The word is often used incorrectly to describe any clay animation movie.

Space Race

The Space Race was a competition of space exploration between the Soviet Union and the United States, which lasted from 1957 to 1975. It had to do with the efforts to explore outer space with artificial satellites, to send humans into space, and to land them on the Moon.

The Space Race began after the Soviet launch of "Sputnik 1" on 4 October 1957. The term "Space Race" started as a comparison to the arms race. The Space Race became an important part of the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Space technology became an extra important area in this rivalry, because of possible military uses.

One part of the space race was the race to put a man into space. This part was won by the Soviet Union when Major Yuri Gagarin orbited the earth on April the 12th 1961.

On May the 25th 1961, in a speech to a joint sitting of congress, President John F Kennedy of the United States of America set the impossible sounding goal of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. This also implied a challenge to the Russians to try to do it first. The Americans won this part of the race in 1969 when Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin Jr landed on the moon and returned safely to the earth.

When talking about chemical solutions, the term supersaturated means that a solution contains more of a substance, that could be solved in it. 

Carbonated water is a supersaturated solution of carbon dioxide gas in water. At the start, the pressure in the bottle is very high. This means that more Carbon dioxide gas can be put into the water than at normal pressure. When the bottle is opened, the pressure falls to the normal level, and the carbon dioxide gas escapes very slowly. Certain things such as small bubbles in the bottle can make this process faster. Such bubbles can be caused by shaking the bottle. Another solute, such as sugar powder or a widget.

A Diet Coke and Mentos eruption is a more extreme example. Some drinks such as ales and stouts e.g. Guinness rely on this effect to produce the 'head' on the surface of the poured product.

African Sanctus

African Sanctus is a musical composition for choir, soloists, orchestra and prerecorded tape by David Fanshawe. It was composed in 1972.

"African Sanctus" is the best-known of Fanshawe's works. It was composed after Fanshawe had made journeys to Africa up the river Nile between 1969 and 1973. The shape of his journey forms the shape of a cross. This had a religious meaning for Fanshawe. He made recordings on tape of the people he met singing their traditional music. A lot of this music had never been recorded before. When he returned home to Britain he composed the "African Sanctus". Some of the recordings he had made in Africa are played as part of the performance. The choir who sing live at the concert are singing some of the words of the traditional Christian Latin Mass.

The recordings are from Egypt, the Sudan, Uganda and Kenya.

At first it was called "African Revelations", but then the title was changed to "African Sanctus". It was first performed in London by the Saltarello Choir in July 1972, and was later played on BBC Radio on United Nations Day. A documentary film was made three years later showing how the work had been composed.














The work has been performed in many places in Britain and all round the world. Fanshawe comes to many of these concerts personally.

In 1994 David Fanshawe composed an extra movement for a new recording of the work, the Dona Nobis Pacem - A Hymn for World Peace, which completed the Agnus Dei. Based on this new recording, the BBC commissioned the maker of the 1975 documentary, Herbert Chappell, to make a new programme, "African Sanctus Revisited",

David Fanshawe (born 19 April 1942 in Devon, England; died 5 July 2010) was an English composer and explorer. He wrote a large amount of music, especially for television programmes. His best-known composition is a choral work called "African Sanctus".

Fanshawe went to school at St George's School, Windsor Castle and Stowe School. He started his career as a musician and producer for documentary films. He studied composition at the Royal College of Music. He became known for the music he wrote for films and TV. In 1970 he performed "Salaams" in the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London. This was a work based on the rhythms of pearl divers in Bahrain.

He spent several years travelling to many parts of the world collecting recordings of people singing their own traditional music. He travelled to the Middle East, then to Africa and to islands of the Pacific Ocean. In all these places he had to get to know the people and get them to trust him so that they would let him record their music.

His "African Sanctus" was a result of his trip down the Nile. It combines recordings he made there with a choir and orchestra singing. It has been performed thousands of times all over the world.

Fanshawe died on 5 July 2010.

Kota Kinabalu

Kota Kinabalu (), formerly Jesselton, is the capital of Sabah state in Malaysia. It is also the capital of the West Coast Division of Sabah. The city is on the northwest coast of Borneo facing the South China Sea. The Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park is on one side and Mount Kinabalu, which gave the city its name, is nearby. Kota Kinabalu proper has a population of 579,304, while the larger urban area has an estimated population of 700,000. It is the largest urban centre in Sabah and the sixth largest in Malaysia.

Kota Kinabalu is often known as K.K. within Malaysia and internationally. It is a major tourist destination and a popular gateway for travellers visiting Sabah and Borneo. Kinabalu National Park is about 90 kilometres from the city and there are many tourist attractions in and around the city. Kota Kinabalu is also one of the major industrial and commercial centres of East Malaysia. These two factors combine to make Kota Kinabalu one of the fastest growing cities in Malaysia.

In the late 1800s, the British North Borneo Company (BNBC) began to establish colonies throughout North Borneo (now Sabah). In 1882, the Company founded a small settlement on Gaya Island (Pulau Gaya), which was already inhabited by the Bajau people. In 1897, this first settlement was burned and destroyed by Bajau rebels led by Mat Salleh.

After the rebellion, the Company decided to relocate the settlement to the more easily defended mainland opposite Pulau Gaya. A nearby fishing village named "Api-Api" (see "Original names" below), was the next settlement of the Company. This new location was then designated as the main harbour and port, as well as the terminus for the North Borneo Railway. It was expanded and renamed "Jesselton", named after Sir Charles Jessel, the then Vice Chairman of the Company.

Eventually, Jesselton became a major trading post of North Borneo, dealing in rubber, rattan, honey, and wax. The new railway was used to transport goods to Jesselton harbour. Bajau uprisings during these times were not uncommon, and the Company worked to quell the long-standing threat of piracy in the region.

Jesselton was razed by the retreating British early in World War II to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Japanese. After the Japanese takeover of Borneo, it was again renamed Api. Rebellions against the Japanese military administration have taken place in Api. One major rebellion occurred in 1943 by the group called Kinabalu Guerrillas, consisting of local inhabitants. The rebellion was however quelled by the Japanese forces, after their leader, Albert Kwok, was arrested and executed in 1944. At the later stages of the war, what remained of the town was destroyed again by Allied bombings as part of the Borneo Campaign in 1945, leaving only three buildings standing. The war in North Borneo ended with the official surrender of the Japanese 37th Army by Lieutenant General Baba Masao in Labuan on September 10, 1945.

After the war, the British North Borneo Company returned to administer Jesselton but was unable to finance the huge costs of reconstruction. They gave control of North Borneo to the British Crown in 1946. The new colonial government elected to rebuild Jesselton as the capital of North Borneo instead of Sandakan, which had also been destroyed by the war.

When North Borneo together with Sarawak, Singapore & Federation of Malaya formed the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, the state became known as Sabah and Jesselton remained its capital. Jesselton was renamed Kota Kinabalu on September 30, 1968 and received official city status from the Malaysian government on February 2, 2000.
Kota Kinabalu is named after Mount Kinabalu, about 90 kilometres east-northeast of the city. The meaning and origin of the name "Kinabalu" is uncertain. One theory suggests it means "Chinese widow", where "Kina" meaning "Chinese" (person) in Kadazandusun language, and "balu" meaning "widow" in Malay language. This theory derives from a folk tale about a Chinese prince who came to the mountain in search of a giant pearl which was guarded by a dragon at the top of the mountain. While he was here, he married a local woman but later returned to China and left the woman heartbroken. Alternatively, it is also argued that "Kinabalu" or "Akinabalu" is the name of the dragon which guards the giant pearl itself. Another theory suggests that the term is derived from the name "Aki Nabalu" meaning the "revered place of the dead", in which, "Aki" means "ancestors" or "grandfather", and "Nabalu" being a name for the mountain in the Dusun language. Finally there is also a source claiming that the term originated from "Ki Nabalu", where "Ki" meaning "have" or "exist", and "Nabalu" meaning "spirit of the dead".

"Kota" is a Malay word for a "fort", "town", or a "city". It is also used formally in a few other Malaysian towns and cities, for example, Kota Bahru, Kota Tinggi, and Kota Kemuning. It could also be used informally to refer to any towns or cities. Henceforth, a direct translation of the name "Kota Kinabalu" into English would be "City of Kinabalu" or "Kinabalu City".

Besides Jesselton, there has been a number of other claims as to the original name for Kota Kinabalu. The most popular, as mentioned above, is "Api-Api", or sometimes simply "Api", which is a Malay word meaning 'Fire'. It was apparently named as such by the mainly Bajau locals to denote the blazing of the British administrative office in Pulau Gaya instigated by Mat Salleh, as well as other blazing incidents normally perpetrated by pirates. There were claims however that it was actually named after a nearby river called "Sungai Api-Api". Another theory states that "Api-Api" is the local name of the common "Avicennia" tree that grows in abundance around the area. Transliterated into the formal Chinese name of "Ya Bi" (亚庇 yà bì), the Hakkas here too adopted this name (亚庇,"ah-bi" which pronounced in Hakka, Chinese dialects) and some still use this name to this day. Besides Api-Api, another suggested historical name was "Deasoka", which roughly means "below the coconut tree" in the Bajau language. The Bajau locals purportedly used this name to refer to a village on the southern part of the city which was filled with coconut trees. Another name was "Singgah Mata" which literally mean "transit eye", but can be loosely translated as meaning "pleasing to the eye". It is a name purportedly given by fishermen from Pulau Gaya referring to the strip of land of what is today Kota Kinabalu city center. Today, all these names have been immortalised into names of streets or buildings around the city. Some examples are: "Lintasan Deasoka", "Api-Api Centre", "Jalan Singgah Mata", and "Jesselton Point".

Being the capital city of Sabah, Kota Kinabalu plays an important role in the political and economic welfare of the population in the entire state. It is the seat of the state government where almost all of their ministries and agencies are based. Most of the Malaysian federal government agencies and departments are also in Kota Kinabalu. The Sabah State Legislative Assembly is at nearby Likas Bay. There are four Members of Parliament (MPs) representing four parliamentary constituencies in the city: Sepanggar ("P.171"), Kota Kinabalu ("P.172"), Putatan ("P.173"), and Penampang ("P.174"). The city also elects 9 representatives to the state legislature from the state assembly districts of Karambunai, Inanam, Likas, Api-Api, Luyang, Tanjung Aru, Petagas, Kepayan, and Moyog.

Kota Kinabalu currently has seven sister cities.


The internal roads linking different parts of the city are generally state roads constructed and maintained by the state Public Works Department. Most major internal roads are dual-carriageways. One of the major road here is Jalan Lintas-Jalan Tuaran Bypass, which together serves almost as a ring road, circling the city and connecting the districts and suburbs surrounding the city, namely, Putatan, Penampang, Luyang, Likas, Inanam, Menggatal, Sepanggar, and Tuaran. There is currently no freeway in the city nor in any part of Sabah. The city is linked by highways to distant towns around Sabah and these are mainly federal roads maintained by the national Public Works Department. Highway routes from Kota Kinabalu include:

Public transportation:

Regular bus services operate around the city. Minibuses or vans are also used besides buses as an alternative public transportation. There are two main bus terminals in the central business area. The terminal along Jalan Tun Razak provides internal bus services towards different part of the city and its outskirts. Another terminal near Bandaran Berjaya provides intercity services towards destinations south of the city (Papar, Tenom, Beaufort, and others). The Kota Kinabalu (North) Bus Terminal in Inanam provides intercity buses heading towards destinations north and north-east of the city (Tuaran, Kudat, Ranau, Sandakan, Tawau, Semporna, and others). Taxicabs too are around the city.

A railway system formerly known as the North Borneo Railway was established in 1896 by the British North Borneo Company. It was built for the main purpose of transporting commodities from the interior to the port in Kota Kinabalu during the British occupation. The railway line connects Kota Kinabalu with Tenom and several other towns in between, and it is the only railway system operating in East Malaysia. Today the railway is known as Sabah State Railway, and it provides daily services for commuters, travellers, as well as for cargo transportation. A separate company operates the leisure tour also called the "North Borneo Railway", which caters mainly for tourists. The train station and terminus are in Tanjung Aru.

Kota Kinabalu International Airport (KKIA) provides flights linking the city with other domestic and international destinations. It is a secondary hub for Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia and it consists of two terminals. It is the second busiest airport in Malaysia after Kuala Lumpur International Airport and it is a major gateway into Sabah and East Malaysia. It serves international flights to Bandar Seri Begawan, Shenzhen, Seoul, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Macau, Manila, Cebu, Singapore, Taibei, Gaoxiong, and other domestic cities. It is also a secondary hub for MASWings, which serves flights to smaller towns and rural areas in East Malaysia.

Kota Kinabalu has two ports: Kota Kinabalu Port and Sepanggar Bay Container Port (SBCP). Kota Kinabalu Port mainly loose/bulk cargo, while SBCP operates as a naval base for the Royal Malaysian Navy, oil depot and all containerised cargo. In 2004, Kota Kinabalu Port handled about 3.6 million tonnes of freight cargo, the third highest in the state after Sandakan Port, and Tawau Port. It however handles the most number of containers in the state, with of containers handled in 2006. Sepanggar Bay Port will have the capacity to handle annually when its container terminal is completed. All ports in Sabah are managed and operated by Sabah Ports Sdn Bhd.

Kota Kinabalu Ferry Terminal is a passenger ferry terminal at Jesselton Point near the K.K. port. It provides ferry and motorboat services to the nearby islands for tourists as well as for commuters living on the islands. There are also regular scheduled ferry services to Labuan.

Temple of Jupiter (Pompeii)

The Temple of Jupiter, Capitolium, or Temple of the Capitoline Triad was a temple in the Roman city of Pompeii in Italy. At the beginning this temple was dedicated to Jupiter alone, it was built in the mid 2nd century BC at the same time as the temple of Apollo was being worked on - this was the era at which Roman influence over Pompeii was at its height and so Roman Jupiter beat out the Greek Apollo as the town's highest god. Jupiter was the ruler of the gods and the protector of Rome, where his temple was the center of Roman Religion and of the cult of state.

As the most important god in Ancient Rome, many temples were built to honor Jupiter or the entire Capitoline Triad (a group of three gods that included Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva) in towns newly taken over by the Romans. This was also true for Pompeii, where the Temple of Jupiter that was already there was enlarged and made more Roman when the Romans took over.

Pompeii was taken over by the Romans beginning in 310 BC. It was still allowed to mostly run itself, however, until the Italic Revolt against Rome at the beginning of the 1st century BC.

The building style of the town was largely borrowed from the Greeks, but Roman rule would soon lead to changes in this style. As opposed to the previous Samnite rulers of Pompeii, the Romans thought that the building style was very important in religious as well as everyday life. Pompeii was changed into a much more public and open place. Public buildings and spaces would eventually be able to be found all over the city. 

The temple had been built in 150 BC to be a very noticeable part of the forum, and it became Pompeii's main temple after Rome took over. The inside of the temple housed the main room of the temple, which held the statues of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, and which only the priests were allowed to enter.

In 62 an earthquake shook the city of Pompeii, destroying much of the Temple of Jupiter. After this, the much smaller Temple of Jupiter Meilichios became the main place of worship to Jupiter and his group of three (). The first Temple of Jupiter was still waiting to be fixed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79, burying the town of Pompeii under lava and ash. The hollow temple can still be seen in Pompeii today.

Gilbert's Potoroo

Gilbert's Potoroo ("Potorous gilbertii") is an Australian marsupial, sometimes called a rat-kangaroo. It has a pointed face and it is about the size of a rabbit. Once thought to be extinct, it is listed as being critically endangered. There are only about 40 of the animals left in the world. Gilbert's Potoroo is one of the world's rarest mammals.

They live in a small area, about , on the southwest coast near Albany, Western Australia. This area is in the Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve. Gilbert's Potoroos have been released on nearby Bald Island, and are breeding successfully. 

Gilbert’s potoroo was first discovered in 1840, and named in 1841 after the English naturalist and explorer John Gilbert. Gilbert had collected several animals at King George Sound in Australia, including this potoroo. Gilbert’s potoroo was not seen again for many years, even though many people had searched for them in the 1970s. The species was believed to be extinct for 120 years before it was re-discovered in 1994 in Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve. Liz Sinclair had been studying wallabies and caught the potoroo in one of her traps. 

Potoroos live under thick bushes and shrubs. They have made tunnels and paths through the bush so they can get around easily. When moving slowly they use all four legs, but to move quickly they can hop like a kangaroo. Potoroos are nocturnal and they spend their days hiding. They only come out into the open very often. They live in small groups of between three to five animals. They eat different kinds of truffles and fungi. Australia has many different kinds of truffles and potoroos like to eat many of them. Potoroos have sharp three toed claws that help them dig into the ground to find the truffles growing in the soil. After eating them, the potoroos help spread the seeds of the truffles through their wastes. Scientists have found 40 different types of fungi in the waste from a Gilbert Potoroo.

The female potoroos can have two babies in a year, but only carry one at a time. They can keep a second embryo in a state of diapause while the first embryo is growing. If the first baby does not survive, the second baby can start growing right away. It is not known how long gestation is for Gilbert’s potoroo, but it is thought to be the same as the Long-nosed Potoroo; about 38 days. The baby potoroo is only about long when it is born. It lives in its mother's pouch four about 4 months.

When Gilbert’s potoroo was rediscovered, more animals were captured to start a breeding program. This would help increase the numbers of potoroos. A few young were born in the first couple of years, but then breeding just stopped. Many studies have looked at what they eat, and how they live, but they are still can not get the potoroos to breed in captivity

In 2001, a group was formed called the Gilbert’s Potoroo Action Group (GPAG). This group helps educate and tell people about the potoroo. It also helps with raising money for more study and captive breeding programs for Gilbert’s potoroo.

Three potoroos, one male and two females, were moved to Bald Island in August 2005. This island is free from other animals, like cats and foxes, that would eat the potoroos. Since then, four more potoroos have been sent to start a breeding colony.

There is a lot of danger for the survival of Gilbert's Potoroo. Because of the small area where they live, they could be lost in a bushfire. Foxes and cats could easily kill all the potoroos. There may not be enough potoroos to give them enough genetic differences to survive a virus. There is not enough natural bushland at Two Peoples Bay, and there is too much cleared land next to the nature reserve.

G V star

In astronomy, a G V star is a main-sequence star of spectral type G and luminosity class V on the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram. Such a star, which can also be called a yellow dwarf, is small (about 0.8 to 1.0 solar masses) and has a surface temperature of between 5,300 and 6,000 K. Like other main-sequence stars, a G V star turns hydrogen to helium in its core by means of nuclear fusion.

Our Sun is the most commonly known (and most easily seen) example of a G V star. Each second, it combines around 600 million tons of hydrogen to helium, changing about 4 million tons of matter to energy. Other G V stars include Alpha Centauri A, Tau Ceti, and 51 Pegasi.

The term "yellow dwarf" is actually an incorrect name, as G stars can be any color from white, for early types like the Sun, to only slightly yellow for the older types. See Spectral Classification for a chart of star color by light type. Our own Sun is in fact white, but looks yellow through the Earth's atmosphere due to what is called Rayleigh scattering. Even though the name "dwarf" is used to compare yellow main sequence stars from giant stars, yellow dwarfs like the Sun are 90% brighter than all of the stars in the Galaxy (which are largely orange dwarfs, red dwarfs, and white dwarfs).

A G V star will combine hydrogen and helium togther to make energy for around 10 billion years, until there are no more gases left to combine inside the center of the star. When this happens, the star will grow to many times its earlier size and become a red giant like the star that is named Aldebaran. Eventually the red giant will lose its outer layers of gas, which will become a planetary nebula, while the inside of the star (also known as the core) will cool and shrink into a small, very heavy white dwarf.

Confederation

A confederation is a group of countries that, by treaty, have given some of their powers to a central government. They do this in order to coordinate their actions in a number of areas. This is like a federation, but without the association being a new country.

A confederation is not the same as a federation, but they have a similarity. A confederation is a group of countries, a federation is a country.

The only example today, is the European Union. Switzerland has the latin name "Confœderatio Helvetica", although it is not a confederation in this sense, but a federation.

<doc id="193583" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193583" title="Les Noces">
Les Noces

Les Noces is a musical composition by Igor Stravinsky. The title means: The Wedding, but it is usually known by the French title "Les Noces" (pronounced “Lay Noss”). 

It was originally written for a ballet, but it is often performed as a concert piece without the dancing. It is for the unusual combination of singers, percussion instruments and four pianos. It is often described as a “dance cantata”.

Stravinsky first thought of the idea of this ballet in 1913. At first he wanted it to be for a large orchestra, like "The Rite of Spring", but then he changed his mind and experimented with other, unusual instruments including a pianola. Then he realized that it would be difficult for the other instruments and the dancers to be together with the pianola (which has a “recording” on an roll of paper). Finally he decided to write it for soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor, and bass soloists, choir and a large group of percussion instruments and four pianos. 

The 1919 version of Les Noces, with cimbaloms, harmonium and pianola, was never heard at the time, and only first performed in 1981 in Paris, conducted by Pierre Boulez.

The ballet as we know it now was first performed on 13 June 1923, by the Ballets Russes with choreography by Bronislava Nijinska. The orchestra was conducted by Ernest Ansermet. 

Stravinsky wrote the words himself using some traditional Russian wedding lyrics. Today the work is usually sung in the original Russian, although sometimes French or English translations are used. 

The music sounded very modern at the time it was written. It often sounds like Russian folk-song, but Stravinsky also uses lots of irregular rhythms which makes it very lively, but also very difficult to perform and to dance to.

The works lasts about 35 minutes.

At the beginning the bride, Nastasia, is having her hair done. She seems to be complaining that it hurts when her hair is pulled. The choir sing to her about how lovely her life will be with her husband, Fétis, and the nightingales will sing to them in the garden. They sing to the Virgin Mary asking her to be with them on their wedding day. They sing about the bridegroom’s fair locks. They ask for a blessing for the young couple. The actual wedding ceremony is not described. In the last of the four scenes we see the wedding feast. The people get very merry and start to get drunk. The bridal couple are finally led to the bridal chamber (the bedroom).

Fort-Liberté

Fort-Liberté (Kréyòl: "Fòlibète"; English: "Fort Liberty") is a city in northeast Haiti, on the Atlantic coast. It is the capital city of the Nord-Est "Département".

The city is on the "Baie de Fort-Liberté" ("Fort-Liberté Bay") about 56 km east of Cap-Haïtien and to the west of the Dominican Republic. It is also the chief town of an "arrondissement" (a part of a department) with the same name. The "arrondissement" has three "communes" (a "commune" is like a municipality): Fort-Liberté, Ferrier (Kreyòl: "Ferye") and Perches (Kreyòl: "Opèch").

Between 1503 and 1505, Nicolás de Ovando, Spanish governor of the Hispaniola, founded the town of "Puerto Real" (English, "Royal Port") where is the present town of "Caracol", to the west of Fort-Liberté. But soon this town was abandoned and the people moved to the east, founding in 1578 a new town with the Taíno name of the region: Bayajá.

In 1606, those persons living in the old Spanish towns of Bayajá and Yaguana had, by orders of the Spanish king, to move to the eastern part of the island, to a new town called Bayaguana, combining the two old names.

Later, when French people founded a new town in this place, they called it Fort-Dauphin in 1731, named after the "Dauphin" (the "Dolphin", son of the French king Louis XV). When the French Republic was founded, the name was changed to "Fort-Liberté" in 1792. After Henri Christophe became King Henri I of Haiti in 1811, he renamed the city Fort-Royal. In 1820, after the death of Christophe, the name was changed back to Fort Liberté.

There are several forts built around the bay. An important one is "Fort Dauphin", sometimes called "Fort Saint Joseph" (Patron Saint of the city) or "Fort Liberté". Other forts in the area are "Fort de la Bouque", "Batterie de l'Anse", "Fort Saint Charles" and "Fort Saint Frédérique".

Fort-Liberté has a small port that also receives international products and serves as a fishing port. Local agricultural products include sugarcane and citrus fruits.

John Gilbert (naturalist)

John Gilbert (1812? – 28 June 1845) was an English naturalist and explorer. He collected animal specimens for English naturalist John Gould. Australia's rarest animal, Gilbert's Potoroo, "Potorous gilberti", and the Gilbert-Einasleigh River were named after him.

Gilbert was born on 14 March, but the exact year is not known. It must have been between 1810 and 1815 and so most books use 1812. Gilbert was a taxidermist for the Zoological Society of London. He met English naturalist John Gould and went to Australia in 1838 with Gould. Gould paid him £100 a year to collect and preserve animals and birds for him

Gould and Gilbert arrived in Hobart on the ship "Parsee" on 19 September 1838. They were going to collect animal and bird specimens for Gould's books. Both worked in Tasmania for a few months. On 4 February 1839, Gilbert went to the Swan River settlement. He worked there for a year, mainly around Perth, collecting for Gould. Gilbert then sailed for Sydney, and in June 1840 took a ship to Port Essington in the north of Australia. In March 1841 he sailed to Singapore, stopping at Timor on the way. From there he sailed for London and arrived at the end of September. He had collected a very large number of birds for Gould, and made many notes on their habits. 

In February 1842 Gilbert returned Australia to collect further specimens. He reached Perth in July and stayed for 17 months in Western Australia. He made his most interesting discoveries among the Wongan Hills, about 100 miles north-east of Perth. He was a fine naturalist and his notes on birds, their habits, diet, song and the names given them by the aborigines were all of great interest and value. Gilbert collected specimens of 432 birds, including 36 species new to Western Australia. He collected 318 mammals, including 22 species not previously known in the west. By the end of January 1844 he was back in Sydney and during the next six months worked his way to the Darling Downs in Queensland.

Gilbert joined Ludwig Leichhardt's expedition in September 1844 which was going to cross Australia's north, from Brisbane to Port Essington. Gilbert, with his experience in the Australian bush, was unofficially the second in charge. The journey was much slower than planned and food supplies were getting low. On 28 June 1845, near the Gulf of Carpentaria, Gilbert was killed when aborigines attacked the explorers. He was buried at the site, but the grave has never been found. The rest of the group reached Port Essington in December 1845.

Leichhardt kept Gilbert's papers and his diary, which, however, was lost for nearly 100 years before its discovery by A. H. Chisholm. Chisholm's research showed Gilbert as a man of much ability and fine character who somewhat ironically had a great respect for the aboriginals. There is a memorial to him in St James church, Sydney with the Latin phrase "Dulce et decorum est pro scientia mori" - "it is sweet and fitting to die for science."

George Antheil

George Antheil (born Trenton, New Jersey, 8 July 1900; died New York City, 12 February 1959) was an American composer, pianist, author and inventor. He became known in America and Europe as a composer of very modern sounding music, including his "Ballet Mécanique". His music was very noisy and full of mechanical sounds. His audiences were often shocked at the music. He spent some years in Europe, then, in 1930s, he returned to America where he spent a lot of time writing film music for Hollywood and ballets. His music became less aggressive and more traditional. 

He had many interests, and spent some time researching female endocrinology, as well as writing a mystery novel and newspaper advice and music columns. Together with the actress Hedy Lamarr he invented and patented a frequency-hopping torpedo guidance system.

Hi people. This is my fourth SN article.

Well, as you all know, we've decided to have local oversighters here at seWP. Three users, namely Barras, Djsasso, Peterdownunder, NonvocalScream and EVula are standing for the election. One of our major problems is that we are still some short of the 25 users mark at seWP. So, I'd like to request retired/former users to return and participate in this election. You all are most welcome. :DD

Last week, we had a dispute about a crat promotion and a discussion about crat chats, changes in RfX requirements is at . Your inputs are welcome.

We were forced to update DYK after 7 instead of 5 days this time. We need more hooks. Your help is needed.

That's all for now. Bye, 17:19, 3 August 2009 (UTC).

Turbojet

A turbojet is a kind of jet engine that works by squeezing air into a small space, mixing it with fuel, and setting it on fire. The mixture of fuel and air goes out the back of the engine and pushes it forward. As it leaves the engine it spins a fan which turns another fan at the front which sucks in more air. 

Turbofan engines are more common today because they can make more power for the same amount of fuel than a turbojet, they also make less noise.

Minicoy Island

Minicoy Island or Maliku (Mahal language: މަލިކު, məliku) is the only inhabited island of the Maliku Atoll. The locals, the "Malikun", call their island "Maliku," as do the Maldivians, the closest Maldive island to Minicoy is Thuraakunu. Since 1956, the occupying Indian Government has forbidden contact between people of the same nationals of the two islands despite their geographic proximity and ethnographic similarities. The cultural traits of Minicoy differ from those of any other Indian islands of Lakshadweep. Manners, customs and food are similar to those of the Maldives to the south of Minicoy and Mahl, a dialect of Dhivehi, is the language spoken on the island. This language employs the Tāna script, written from right to left. Minicoy Islanders, like the close islands of the Maldives follow Sunni Islam. The islands were probably Buddhist before like they were in the Maldives. In August 1947 the possessions of the Emperor of British India passed to either the Indian Union or Pakistan according to an agreed demarcation line. The rulers of the independent countries that were vassals of the Emperor had the choice of acceding to either the Dominion of India or Pakistan.

While Maliku was a sovereign possession of the Emperor and not that of an independent country such as, Kashmir or Hyderabad State, it is unclear why India felt it necessary to hold a plebiscite in Maliku in 1956 to determine whether or not the people of Maliku wished to join the Indian Union. However Since 1965 Pakistan wished Maliku to return to the Republic of Maldives.

Razakars (Pakistan)

Razakars was the name given to a paramilitary force organized by the Pakistan Army during the Pakistani Civil war in 1971. The word, originating from Persian, literally means "volunteer". It was composed of mostly pro-Pakistani Bengalis and Urdu-speaking migrants to erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). Initially, the force was under the command of local pro-Pakistani committees. But through the East Pakistan Razakar Ordinance (promulgated by General Tikka Khan on 1 June, 1971) and a Ministry of Defence, Pakistan, ordinance (promulaged 7 September,1971), Razakars were recognized as members of the Pakistan Army.

Qasim Razvi

Qasim Razvi was the leader of a local militia, the Razakars of Hyderabad State, who blocked accession into the Dominion of India after the Partition of British Indian empire against the wishes of the local majority Hindu-population, and fought against the Indian forces during occupation.

Razvi held views that Hyderabad should eventually join Pakistan in a major war against Bharat, as clearly evidenced by some of his speeches and publications in Hyderabadi newspapers. Razvi was politically powerful and a close advisor of the Nizam, whom he encouraged to defy the infidel government, and blocked the invasion of Hyderabad into Republic of India. At the height of the crisis, Razvi had placed his allies in influential posts, and was virtually dictating the Nizam's policy on the issue. Razvi even traveled to Delhi and had a stormy meeting with Indian leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. He is quoted to have said "Death with the sword in hand, is always preferable to extinction by a mere stroke of the pen. "prompting the Indian government to call him the "Nizam's Frankenstein monster."

After Indian military intervention, Razvi was placed under house arrest and tried under Indian laws on seditious activities and inciting communal violence. He was released in the 1950s, and he later fled to Pakistan.

Al-Shams (1971)

Al-Shams (আল শামস) was a militia force formed in East Pakistan in early 1971 by the Pakistan Army.

Al-Shams is an Arabic word meaning 'The Sun'. Al Shams and Al-Badr were Pakistani armed groups formed by the Pakistan Army to fight out and resist Mukti Bahini and support the army in its campaigns in the former East Pakistan provincial region.

Al-Badar (1971)

Al-Badar (আল বদর) was a paramilitary force formed in East Pakistan in 1971 by the national Pakistan Army.

Al-Badar means The Battlefield of Badar. The politics of the force were intermingled with jihad, the religious war or holy war of Muhammad 1400 years earlier. However, the war between Pakistan and Bengali separatists was a nationalistic war, not a religious one.

On March 27, 1971, after beginning the Pakistani Civil War, Pakistani military forces needed military support from Bengali nationalists supporters who still wanted to be part of Pakistan, or did not like Indian involvement in the movement; as well as the non-Bengali muhajirs in order to abolish the independence fighters of Bangladesh, the Mukti Bahini, Hemayet Bahini and Kaderiya Bahini. The Al Badar were formed to find these independence fighters and to be guides as well as co-fighters who were familiar with the local terrain.

The force was composed of madrasa students and teachers, Bengali supporters of Muslim League and Jamaat E Islami, and "muhajirs" coming from non-Bengali part of India.

There were three type of Paramilitary forces Pakistan formed, 1. Razakars: refuges who were came from other parts of India during separation of India and Pakistan, and settled in East Pakistan. 2. Al-Badar: Bengali Muslim Students from Colleges, universities and madrasah, who were loyal to Jamat-e-islami.3. Al-Shams: Bengali Madrasah Students, teachers & supporters of Islamic parties other than Jamat-E-Islami (these smaller parties included Nejam-e-Islami and various factions of Muslim League).

Al-Badar was a very organized par military force among those three forces, with their own hierarchy of organization and reporting system.

The Al Badar were given a variety of combat and non-combat tasks including:

On 16 December 1971, Pakistan unconditionally surrendered. Members of Al Badar, along with other Razakars, Al-Shams (1971), and Shanti Committee also surrendered to the Mitro Bahini's. As they all were Bengali it was supposed that Bangladesh would treat them as an opposition party, that is they would arrest them and treat them as prisoners of war. However most of them were tortured, killed by Mukti Bahini, or forced into exile from Bangladesh.

A book is also written on Al Badar and is called "Al Badar".

All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference

The All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference is a major political party of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. 

In 1932 Pro-Congress Sheikh Abdullah formed Kashmir's first political party, the All Jammu & Kashmir Muslim Conference, with a demand for merger of Kashmir and Jammu with Hindu India. His party was renamed the National Conference in 1939 to suite the secular nature of Kashmiri culture. The All Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, led by Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah, espoused a secular ideology and wished to create a secular, democratic but independent Kashmir with close ties to British India. 

When the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference was converted into a secular political party in 1939, the Muslim leaders amended the Constitution of the Muslim Conference, renamed it as the All Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, modified its objectives and threw its membership open to all the people of the State. On 13 June 1941, the breakaway factions of the National Conference revived the erstwhile Muslim Conference under the leadership of Choudry Ghualm Abbas. 

The All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference led the Muslim movement for accession into Pakistans favor in the State. 

On July 19, 1947, a convention of All Jammu & Kashmir Muslim Conference, adopted the "Accession to Pakistan Resolution" demanding accession of the Kashmir state to Pakistan. 

In 1955 the All-Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference was the political party in power in Azad Jammu and Kashmir. Even today All-jummu and Kashmir Muslim Conference is in power in Azad Jamu and Kashmir.

The movement was started by the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference after its induction as a political platform of the Muslims in August 1932 in Srinagar. Prominent amongst the participants were Sardar Gohar Rehman, Chaudhry Ghulam Abbass, Khwaja Ghulam Ahmad Ashai, Mistri Yaqoob Ali, Sheikh Ghulam Qadir and even Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah himself. Sardar Gohar Rehman favoured the formation of Provincial Muslim Conference in Jammu, but he was prevailed upon by the others to relegate his demand in favour of All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference. 
To unite Kashmiri Muslims on a common platform. It was an enormous task in the wake of the deep variance in the political thinking of Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah and Mir Waiz Mohammed Yusuf Shah who parted way along with his his aides towards the end of the first session.

Cornish nationalism

The Cornish self-government movement (sometimes referred to as Cornish nationalism) is a social movement which seeks greater autonomy for the distinctive area of Cornwall. The movement's advocates argue that Cornwall is not merely a county of England (which is its current administrative status) but a duchy and a distinctive British nation which has never been formally incorporated into England via an Act of Union of 1707. Supporters of Cornish self-government who assert that Cornwall is, or ought to be, a separate legal entity from England do not necessarily mean to advocate full independence from the United Kingdom, but rather seek official recognition for Cornwall as one of the constituent countries or home nations of the UK.

Some supporters of Cornish self-government question the legitimacy of English rule in Cornwall, due to the failure of the former Parliament of England to ever pass an Act of Union, although their claims are not generally recognised within the United Kingdom (or sometimes within Cornwall itself). However, many see some degree of autonomy as a stepping stone towards this, and are supportive of the Cornish Assembly Campaign.

Calculator

A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, a normal calculator will add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
Some also do square roots, and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs. Calculators are found everywhere. A computer can act as a calculator. 

Some calculators, like the abacus, will work without batteries. Others, like the electronic calculator, most of the time require batteries. There are two types of electronic calculators: simple calculators, which can only add, subtract, multiply and divide, and sometimes take square roots; and scientific calculators, which can do many other things, such as calculate factorials, sines and cosines.

There are different ways to write mathematics on a calculator. For example, after pressing "3" and then "+" and then "2" and then "=" (or "ENTER") the number "5" will be displayed on the screen. This is called infix notation. Many more advanced calculators use postfix notation, that is, "3 4 +" instead of "3 + 4 =". The third way of noting things, "+ 3 4", called prefix notation, is rarely found on calculators.

A pocket calculator is a small calculator that helps people do mathematics. It is so small that it can be put in a pocket. Its most common use is for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Pocket calculators are often powered by solar cells with a technology known as photovoltaics. They are commonly seen in schools and businesses around the world and can be used quickly and efficiently for simple mathematical problems. Another name for them is 'miniature calculator' or 'mini calculator'.

A scientific calculator can do more things. It can often use exponents, pi, trigonometric ratios, and the order of operations. Scientific calculators can also use bigger numbers. They tend to cost more than pocket calculators.

<doc id="193940" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193940" title="Plurality voting">
Plurality voting

Plurality voting is the most common method for electing representatives in the United States. Voters vote for one candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins. 

Political parties often use a primary in order to avoid splitting their party vote in the general election. For example, if 60% of the voters are Republican, and 40% Democrat, but two Republicans run for the same office and each get 30% of the vote, the Democrat would win with 40%, since that is the most votes, even if 60% of voters least preferred the Democrat. 

If more than two candidates are on the general election ballot, voters often compromise vote an acceptable candidate whom the media told them has a chance of winning. 

Opponents of plurality voting argue that the media has too much power since they tell people which of the two has a chance and that voting for a third candidate is in effect voting for the worse of the two strong candidates. It is theoretically possible that the two "front runner" candidates not to be not centrist and not to represent the people if the media are controlled by those candidates.

Proponents of plurality voting argue that it is very simple and that it forces voters to elect a centrist candidate through compromise voting.

Instant Runoff Voting

Instant runoff voting is a method of electing one political candidate to office from a list of more than two, but it can also be used for other group decisions. Voters rank the candidates from favorite to least favorite, with only their top choices being counted each time. Ballots are counted, and a series of simulated rounds is conducted. If no candidate has a majority of the votes in any round, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and those voter's next choice votes are then counted. This is repeated until a candidate has a majority.

Instant runoff voting has been used in Australia's lower house for more than 80 years. That house is strongly dominated by two parties. It has also been used to elect mayors in some cities in the United States. Voter turn out is typically the same as with plurality voting.

Proponents believe instant runoff voting allows them to vote for their first choice candidate and still help the lessor of evils if the first choice is eliminated. They believe Instant Runoff Voting to be the only way let voters vote their true intentions and undermine the two-party system. By having more candidates on the ballot, incumbents are more likely to be kicked out of office.

Opponents argue that if at least three candidates have a chance of winning, voting for one's favorite could cause a compromise candidate to lose in the first round. Their favorite might then lose against the least preferred candidate in the second round. Voters' votes cannot be transferred to their second choice if their second choice is eliminated before their first choice is. Voters often use their first choice vote for a compromise vote, the same as with plurality.

While theoretically simple, instant runoff voting often requires computers because the rankings on each ballot matter for determining the elimination order and can ot be counted in aggregate. Opponents of Instant runoff voting often oppose computer counting of ballots, since it is difficult for ordinary citizens to count the ballots by hand and catch any fraud. The fact that a candidate has fewer votes does not mean the candidate is less popular but that the candidate was squeezed out on both sides of the political spectrum. Instant runoff voting can eliminate centrists in the last elimination.

Harrier Jump Jet

The Harrier Jump Jet, usually called the Harrier is a British-designed military aeroplane. It was designed during the 1960s. The Harrier is well-known as it can take off vertically. It can do this by changing the direction of thrust from its engines. It is sometimes called V/STOL which means "Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing".

In 1967, the Bristol Engine Company came up with the radical idea of a directed thrust engine. Next, Hawker Aircraft came up with a design for an aeroplane that could meet the NATO specification for a "light tactical support fighter". There was no financial support for the development from HM Treasury, but support was found from NATO.

A prototype flew in 1960. Various changes were made, until the first planes flew for the RAF and Royal Navy in 1969. The planes were built in both Britain and the United States. They were redeveloped and manufactured by British Aerospace and Macdonald Douglas, companies which are now owned by BAE Systems and Boeing, respectively. At present the Boeing/BAE Systems AV-8B Harrier II is used by NATO countries such as the United States, Spain and Italy. A modified version, the BAE Systems/Boeing Harrier II is used by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy.

Between 1969 and 2003, 824 Harrier variants were delivered. Manufacture of new Harriers ended in 1997. The last remanufactured aircraft (Harrier II Plus configuration) was delivered in December 2003. This ended the Harrier production line.

The Harrier is used by many military forces. The United States Marine Corps and the Royal Air Force (RAF) use versions which are specially designed for taking off and landing on aircraft carriers. Other countries which use the Harrier include Thailand and India.

In 2006, the RAF introduced a new version of the Harrier, the GR/9. This is an updated version of the previous version, the GR/7. It has a top speed of 574 knots.

The Harrier was used a lot during the Falklands War. Harriers flew a total of 1,561 sorties, shot down 20 enemy planes (+ 3 probables) with 10 Harriers lost. Of the ten lost, only six were shot down; the others were damaged in accidents on the carrier. The Sea Harriers made the Argentine Air Force much less effective than they hoped to be.

The Harrier can carry different equipment for each mission. It can carry missiles and bombs. It can also carry cameras to take pictures of the ground.

Avro Vulcan

The Avro Vulcan (also Avro 698 Vulcan) is a delta wing bomber aircraft. It was part of the RAF V bombers which were used by the Royal Air Force as a nuclear deterrent during the Cold War. The other aircraft in the V bombers were the Vickers and Valiant. The Vulcan was also used for long-distance bombing runs during the Falklands War. 

In 1947, the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence said it needed a bomber aircraft that could fly a long way and very high. It also needed to carry a lot of bombs. The prototype Vulcan flew in 1948. It crashed in 1949, but development carried on. Over 100 aircraft were built between 1956 and 1965.

The crew of the Vulcan was made up of five people – two pilots, two and one electronics officer. The Vulcan was originally used as part of the United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent. It carried the United Kingdom's first nuclear weapon, called "Blue Danube".

The Vulcan was also used sometimes for reconnaissance. It was retired from the Royal Air Force in 1984.

Barthold Fles

Barthold Fles (February 7, 1902 - December 19, 1989) was a Dutch-American who worked as a literary agent, helping writers find publishers to print their books. He also wrote books and articles, edited texts, translated books from German to English, and published poetry books.

Barthold Fles was born in Amsterdam on February 7, 1902. His family was Jewish but did not keep Jewish laws. His father, Louis Fles, thought that it was wrong for Jews and other people to be religious. Louis Fles imported typewriters and sold them, in addition to other office products, in several stores that he owned and to other stores. Barthold was his oldest son so his father wanted him to help him at work. Barthold did not want to work for his father. He only wanted to read. Barthold read in Dutch, German, English, and French. He read a lot and very fast. Barthold found a job at De Lange publishers. In 1923 he left for the United States. 

In New York Fles first worked as a violinist, painting apartments, selling vacuum cleaners and for publishers. In 1933 he started his own business, a "literary agency", in Manhattan, New York. As a "literary agent" he mostly helped writers find publishers. He also sold stories for films or magazines and would find a writer to make a book that a publisher wanted. When Barthold started working as a literary agent, many of his clients were people who left Germany for the United States because of the Nazism in Germany. He held meetings for these writers in New York so that they could learn about publishing books and stories in the United States. Later, however, most of the writers he worked with were born in the United States. 

In 1936 Barthold married Ruth Grünwald, a dancer at the Metropolitan Opera who had been just one year in the United States. Ruth helped Barthold with his work. Later she left him. Although he had no children of his own, Barthold Fles wrote two books for kids: "Slavonic rhapsody: the life of Antonín Dvořák" (in 1948) and "East Germany" (in 1973). He also wrote many articles and introductions to story collections. He translated three books from German to English. One of these books, Bambi's Children by Felix Salten, was also a book for children. 

In 1986, when he was 84 years old, Fles stopped working. He went back to the Netherlands, and lived three years in a home for retired artists. He died on December 19, 1989 at the age of 87.

Folder (computing)

When talking about file systems, a folder (also called directory, or catalog) is a way to organize computer files. A folder is a storage space that many files can be placed into to group them together and organize the computer. A folder can also contain other folders. For many computer software applications, there is a current working directory. This is the folder that the application runs in. In Unix and Linux, a directory is a special type of file.

Folders can be put together to make a "filesystem" and are laid out like a tree. The folders inside folders are like branches and sub-branches off the tree trunk. This idea is used by the software to allow the user to navigate the folders. On some operating systems, shortcuts or links can be made from one folder to another to make it appear that one folder is contained in two different parent folders. On Unix systems, this is called a "symbolic link", and is similar in function to a hyperlink.

Computer icon

An icon when talked about in computing is a picture which usually stands for a computer program, computer file, folder, or an action for a program to do. Icons are usually small pictures, but not always. Sometimes the user can change what size an icon is.

Icons are used in many places on a computer. The desktop contains icons as shortcuts - clicking on these icons opens up the file, folder, or application that they stand for. For example in Microsoft Windows the desktop will often have an icon for the Recycle Bin, and the icon usually looks like a trash can.

Shortcut icons also show up in other places such as folders and the start menu. These icons work the same as on the desktop.

Many computer programs use icons on "buttons". When the user clicks on the button, something happens. For example, a button with an icon of a printer will usually help the user print what is currently open. While a button with a magnifying glass will let the user search for something.

<doc id="194055" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194055" title="Peter Grimes">
Peter Grimes

Peter Grimes is an opera by Benjamin Britten. It was first performed in 1945. It is generally thought to be the most important British opera of the 20th century. It is about a community in a small fishing village in the east of England in the 1820s. Peter Grimes is a fisherman who feels that the people do not want to have anything to do with him. He wants to make lots of money so that he can marry and get people’s respect. In his obsession with catching as much fish as possible he is cruel to the boys who help him (his apprentices), and they die. At the end of the opera Grimes drowns himself.

Britten wrote the main part (Peter Grimes) for his lifelong friend Peter Pears to sing.

There are three acts, and the opera starts with a prologue and ends with an epilogue. Some of the scenes are joined by continuous music, and some of this is often played separately in concerts. This music is known as the Four Sea Interludes.

When World War II started Britten and Pears went to America to avoid the war. In 1941 Britten started to feel homesick because he read an article by E.M.Forster about George Crabbe, a poet who had lived in the same part of England that Britten came from. Britten started to realize that, in order to compose well, he had to go back to his own country. Britten and Pears returned to England in 1942. 

The conductor Sergei Koussevitzky asked Britten to write an opera based on a poem by George Crabbe. The poem, called “The Borough”, was about the story of Peter Grimes. The village in the poem was fictitious, but it was very much like Aldeburgh where Britten later made his home. Britten asked Montagu Slater to write the libretto based on the story of Crabbe’s poem.

The opera was first performed at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London on 7 June 1945 by the company which later became English National Opera. The conductor was Reginald Goodall. Pears sang the title role. 

The first American performance was in 1946 at Tanglewood conducted by Koussevitzky's pupil, Leonard Bernstein. Britten dedicated it to Koussevitsky’s wife.
The first young boy who was an apprentice to Peter Grimes has already been killed. He was at sea for three days without water to drink. An inquest is being held to decide whether Grimes is guilty of the boy’s death. The people all seem to think he is guilty. The judge decides that the boy’s death was an accident. However, he says to Grimes that he should not get another apprentice. Grimes is very angry at being told this. Ellen Orford, a school teacher, comforts him. In their beautiful duet Ellen and Peter sing at first in different keys, but finally sing together in the same key.

The scenery shows the Moot Hall, the Boar Inn (the village pub) and the church. People are saying “Good morning” to one another, especially the Rector who says it many times. The fishermen start work mending their nets. Keene tells Grimes that he has found another apprentice for him. He is a poor boy who lives in the workhouse. Nobody wants Grimes to have another apprentice. Hobson, the cart man, refuses to fetch him. But Ellen supports Peter. She sings to the crowd: “Let her among you without fault cast the first stone” (meaning: “You all have faults so do not criticize”). Hobson goes off to get the boy. A terrible storm is coming. 

The scene now changes to The Boar Inn. It is very noisy inside. Bob Boles gets drunk and wants to make love to the landlady’s nieces. The storm is still raging outside. Grimes comes in. People are shocked, but Grimes does not notice. He sings and song about human fate: “Now the Great Bear and Pleiades”. The tune is in the orchestra in canon while Grimes sings very simple lines of music. People are embarrassed, so they start to sing a round: “Old Joe has gone fishing”. It has three tunes and has seven counts in a bar. The boy is brought in and Grimes takes him off in spite of the storm.
The opening of the next act is peaceful. It is Sunday morning. People are in church, and now again we hear the singing coming from the church. Ellen talks to the boy. She is horrified to see he has a bruise on his neck. Grimes says it was an accident. He gets annoyed that Ellen is worried about the boy and runs off with him. The people of the village have noticed and march up to Grimes’s hut. The scene ends with a peaceful contrast: a duet sung by the two nieces.

The orchestra play a beautiful passacaglia which links to the next scene. Grimes is accusing the boy of “telling stories”. Then he starts to feels guilty about the first boy’s death. He hears the villagers coming and tells the boy they have to go fishing. He pushes him out onto the rocks and the boy falls to his death. When the villagers arrive at the hut they find it empty.

Act 3 opens with music describing moonlight at night. People are dancing in the Moot Hall. People are very merry. Mrs. Sedley tries to tell people that Grimes is a murderer, but they do not listen. People then start to leave, saying “Goodnight” to one another (especially the Rector). Balstrode is walking with Ellen. He tells her that Grimes’s boat is in, but Grimes cannot be found. A boy’s jersey has been washed up on the shore. Ellen sings an aria “Embroidery in childhood was a luxury of idleness”. It is a moment of stillness in the drama.

A short interlude based on one chord leads to the next scene in which people are looking for Grimes. Grimes drags himself onto the shore. He seems to have gone mad. We hear a foghorn (played by an off-stage tuba) as he sings. Balstrode tells Grimes that he should go out to sea in his boat and sink it.

The opera ends with an epilogue in which the scene is the same as the beginning of the opera. Someone says that a boat has been seen sinking out to sea, but no one is interested. The people have forgotten Grimes, and continue their lives without him.

Tanggula Railway Station

Tanggula railway station is a railway station on the Qingzang railway in Tibet. It is in Amdo County. Tibet is currently an Autonomous Region inside China. At an altitude of 5,068 meters above sea level it is said to be the highest train station in the world. The next higher station outside China was Ticlio station in (Peru), at 4,829 m.

In 2009, the station was closed, but there are plans to make special trains for tourists stop there.

Tanggula railway station is less than one kilometre from Tanggula Pass which is the highest point of the Qingzang railway. That point is 5,072 meters above sea level. 

There are no staff at the station, which opened for service on July 1, 2006. Some say that the railway was built to help China control the people of Tibet.

There are three railway tracks at the station. Two of them can be accessed by a platform. The platforms are 1.25km long. The place where the station was built was specially selected for the view it offers. 

In 2008, Tangula Railtours will launch a tourist train service from Beijing to Lhasa through the pass. Three specially-built luxury trains will be used for the service.

Harry Patch

Henry "Harry" Patch (born 17 June 1898; died 25 July 2009) was an ordinary man for most of his life. He fought bravely in the trenches in World War I. He became a plumber and firefighter. He never talked to anybody about his terrible experiences in the trenches. When he was 100 years old he decided he should tell people about what he had seen in the war. He still had 11 more years to live after that. When he died at the age of 111 he was the last British person who had fought in the First World War. This is why he was known as "the Last Tommy". For the last seven days of his life he was the oldest man in Europe. He did not want to have a state funeral. The funeral was at Wells Cathedral. A very large number of people came. They were mostly ordinary people, but there were also some important people including the Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. For many of the people there it was a last opportunity to pay respects to the people who fought in the war.

Harry decided to talk about his experiences because he wanted everyone to realize how terrible wars are. When he talked to the BBC he said: "...if any man tells you he went over the top and he wasn't scared, he's a damn liar." In the same series, he talked about his friends who were killed, and about the moment when he came face to face with a German soldier. He remembered the Bible story about Moses coming down from Mount Sinai with God's commandment, 'thou shalt not kill'. He could not bring himself to kill the German. Instead, he shot him in the shoulder, which made him drop his rifle. But the German carried on running towards Patch's gun, so he then shot him above the knee, and in the ankle. Patch said, "I had about five seconds to make the decision. I brought him down, but I didn't kill him."

Patch was born and died in Somerset. In his last years he lived in a nursing home in Wells where he died on 25 July 2009 just seven days after the death of Henry Allingham, aged 113, who had been the only other remaining British-resident First World War veteran. Harry Patch received eight medals.

Tommy Atkins (often just Tommy) is a term for a common soldier in the British Army. The term was used in the 19th century, but it is particularly associated with World War I. It can be used when talking about the soldiers, or when speaking to them. German soldiers would call out to "Tommy" across no man's land if they wanted to speak to a British soldier. French and Commonwealth troops would also call British soldiers "Tommies".

Harry Patch, who died aged 111 on 25 July 2009 was known as the "Last Tommy" because he was the last surviving British soldier who fought in World War I.

Henry Allingham (born London, 6 June 1896; died 18 July 2009) was a British supercentenarian and First World War veteran. He was an engineer for most of his life. For the last month of his life he was the oldest living man in the world (according to official records). He became the oldest man ever in Britain.

Allingham was the oldest ever member of any of the British Armed Forces and the oldest veteran of the First World War. He was the last survivor of the Battle of Jutland, the last surviving member of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and the last surviving founding member of the Royal Air Force. Between his 110th and 111th birthdays Allingham made over 60 public appearances, including a visit to The Oval on 5 June 2007 (the day before his 111th birthday), where he was wheeled around the boundary in front of the spectators.

With the help of Denis Goodwin, he wrote a book about his life. It was published on 23 September 2008. 

"Allingham planned to leave his body to medical science. Allingham said that Denis Goodwin persuaded him to change his mind, because he had become a symbol of the war. So he had a funeral and cremation.

Henry Allingham had four medals, two of which were from the First World War.

The BBC asked Carol Ann Duffy, the Poet laureate, to write a poem to mark the deaths of Allingham and Harry Patch (who died one week after Allingham on 25 July 2009).

Page (servant)

A page or page boy is a young male servant. A different meaning of "page boy", but based on the same idea of one who serves, is for a young boy who helps the bride at a wedding.

In medieval times, a page was a servant to a knight. He had to clean things, help the knight, for example by running messages for him. He also learned how to fight. When he was 14 he usually became a squire. When he was 21 he sometimes became a knight.

Pages were treated well. In the Christmas carol "Good King Wenceslas" we hear about the King's page: "Hither, page, and stand by me, if thou know'st it, telling..."
During the Renaissance and after it became fashionable for black boys and young men to be decorative pages. They wore fancy costumes and served fashionable ladies and lords. This custom of having an "African page" lasted for several centuries. This type of page is almost unheard of today.

<doc id="194143" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194143" title="Essjay controversy">
Essjay controversy

The Essjay controversy is about a well known Wikipedia administrator and salaried Wikia worker, Essjay, who later said he was Ryan Jordan.

In February 2007, Essjay was discovered to have made false claims about his school certificates and job experiences on his Wikipedia user page and to news reporter Stacy Schiff during a report for "The New Yorker".

Many people reacted in many ways to the controversy. Many articles and comments were made electronic, print, and broadcast media; the Wikipedia community checked Essjay's article changes to check for errors and debated proposals to improve the project's handling of personal identification. In his activities as an editor, Essjay had spent less time changing the content of articles and more time addressing vandalism and resolving editorial disputes.

Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales supported Essjay's use of an identity, saying, "I regard it as a pseudonym and I don’t really have a problem with it." Later Wales changed his opinion and asked for Essjay to quit from his jobs with Wikipedia and Wikia. Wales stated that he withdrew his support when he learned "that EssJay used his false credentials in content disputes" on Wikipedia.

Stacy Schiff, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter writing for "The New Yorker", interviewed Essjay as a source for an article about Wikipedia. ("Know It All"; July 31, 2006) He was suggested for this to her by a member of the Wikimedia Foundation. "The New Yorker", said Essjay "was willing to describe his work as a Wikipedia administrator but would not identify himself other than by confirming the biographical details that appeared on his user page."

During the interview, Jordan told "The New Yorker" and had said on his Wikipedia user page that he had doctoral degrees in theology and canon law. He also said he worked as a tenured professor at a private university. It was later found that he was 24 years old and had quit community college with no qualifications. "The New Yorker" published a correction in February 2007, which brought the issue to broader public attention.

The article said that Essjay was on Wikipedia some 14 hours or more a day. The article also said he was careful to keep his online life a secret from his co-workers and friends. Essjay was pictured as taking his laptop to class so he could be available to other Wikipedians while giving a quiz. He said that he needed anonymity to avoid cyberstalking.

Essjay said that he had sent an email to a college professor using his false persona's credentials, telling for Wikipedia's accuracy. In the message he wrote in part, "I am an administrator of the online encyclopedia project Wikipedia. I am also a tenured professor of theology; feel free to have a look at my Wikipedia userpage (linked below) to gain an idea of my background and credentials."

When Essjay was hired by Wikia in January 2007, he made changes to his Wikia profile and "came clean on who he really was," showing himself as Ryan Jordan. Other Wikipedia editors asked Essjay questions on his Wikipedia talk page about the difference between his new Wikia profile and his previously claimed credentials. Essjay posted a reason in response to the first question, saying that:

He later said on his Wikipedia user page about having fooled Schiff by "doing a good job playing the part."

Social activist and Wikipedia critic Daniel Brandt then told "The New Yorker" about the difference in profiles. In late February 2007 the magazine updated its article with a change (correction) saying that "Essjay now says that his real name is Ryan Jordan, that he is twenty-four and holds no advanced degrees, and that he has never taught."

On March 3, 2007, Andrew Lih, Assistant Professor and Director of Technology Journalism and of the Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong, said on his blog that a part of Essjay's comments on the incident entered "the dangerous domain of defamation and libel" against Stacy Schiff. Lih quoted Essjay as writing on his Wikipedia talk page: "Further, she [Schiff] made several offers to compensate me for my time, and my response was that if she truly felt the need to do so, she should donate to the Foundation instead." Lih noted:

Lih wrote that he contacted Schiff for comment about whether she had offered to pay Essjay for his time and quoted her return email. In it Schiff said that Essjay's statement was "complete nonsense."

Talking about Jordan, Wales said, “Mr. Ryan was a friend, and still is a friend. He is a young man, and he has offered me a heartfelt personal apology, which I have accepted. I hope the world will let him go in peace to build an honorable life and reputation.”
Essjay had said in reply at the time with a statement on his Wikipedia page, in part saying:

Reaction from inside the Wikipedia community to the Essjay/Jordan identity difference was pointed. There were many comments. While most editors opposed at least some of his actions, responses ranged from offering complete support to accusing Jordan of fraud.

As the controversy went further, the Wikipedia community began looking at Essjay's previous changes. Some felt he had relied upon his false professorship to prove he was right about his changes. "People have gone through his edits and found places where he was basically cashing in on his fake credentials to bolster his arguments," said Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator and founder of the Wikipedia community newspaper, "The Wikipedia Signpost". "Those will get looked at again." For instance, Essjay had recommended sources such as "Catholicism for Dummies," a book granted the nihil obstat and imprimatur by the Roman Catholic Church. Essjay defended his use of the book by telling fellow Wikipedia editors in a disagreement over the editing of the article Imprimatur: "This is a text I often require for my students, and I would hang my own Ph.D. on it’s credibility."
Wales was "...reported to be considering all persons who on factual disputes." "I don't think this incident exposes any inherent weakness in Wikipedia, but it does expose a weakness that we will be working to address," Wales added. He insisted that Wikipedia editors still would be able to remain anonymous if they wished. "We always prefer to give a positive incentive rather than absolute prohibition, so that people can contribute without a lot of hassle", Wales commented. However, he also warned that “It's always inappropriate to try to win an argument by flashing your credentials, and even more so if those credentials are inaccurate.” Wales argued "contributors to the site who claim certain credentials will soon have to prove they really have them." However, Florence Devouard, chair of the Wikimedia Foundation, was not supportive of his credential suggestion, saying, "I think what matters is the quality of the content, which we can improve by enforcing policies such as 'cite your source,' not the quality of credentials showed by an editor." A formal suggestion that users saying to have qualification would have to give something to prove they really do have them, before using them was rejected by the Wikipedia community, like all previous such suggestions.

As a follow-up to his first comments to "The New Yorker", Wales wrote this apology to the magazine, which showed in its March 19, 2007 issue:

Wales stated his regret that Essjay had "made a series of very bad judgments." He said he hopes the Wkipedia would be better off from the controversy.

Andrew Orlowski, a Wikipedia critic and writer for "The Register"—a British technology news and opinion website—criticized Jimmy Wales for hiring Essjay at the venture-capital-funded 'Wikia' and for making him a member on the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee. Essjay had admitted his stated academic and professional credentials were false before he was made a member. Orlowski added that Essjay's actions showed a harmful community way of thinking inside Wikipedia.

Others to comment negatively included ZDNet writer Mitch Ratcliffe. Ratcliffe asked "why lying about one's background qualifies a person to work for a company like Wikia, which proposes to help communities to record accurate information" and asked for additional details "such as when he fired Jordan and the reasons for the firing, as well as when he endorsed Jordan in public statements."

Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief of online encyclopedia Citizendium, and a co-founder of Wikipedia who quit the project in 2002, called Essjay's response "a defiant non-apology" and elsewhere stated Essjay's actions as "identity fraud."
Showing comments by Essjay on his Wikipedia talk pages, Sanger stated that other members of Wikipedia management, including Angela Beesley (co-founder of Wikia and a member of Wikimedia Foundation's Communications Committee) and Brad Patrick (legal counsel for the Wikimedia Foundation) had worked in hiring Jordan when they knew of the identity difference. Sanger also made note that Jordan's dismissal was the result of public response. That "Only after these sad facts were publicly made aware, only after there was a response, did Jimmy Wales decide to ask for Essjay’s to quit."

Other comments:

Following the media broadcast of the Essjay controversy, a number of people noted the damage to the credibility of Wikipedia. On March 2, 2007, a report in "The Chronicle of Higher Education" commented "the incident is clearly damaging to Wikipedia's credibility—especially with professors who will now note that one of the site's most visible academics has turned out to be a fraud." Ross Brann, a professor of Judeo-Islamic classes at Cornell University in Ithaca, stated that Wikipedia is without a way to expertly review, saying, "They could make up your life if they wanted to." Brann also said that Wikipedia "has no place in the University," and he believed the Essjay incident would do nothing to change the negative opinion that academics generally hold about the online encyclopedia. Students at Cornell stated that they may continue to use Wikipedia as a quick source of information, though they would not cite it in scholarly work.

<doc id="194154" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194154" title="Gameplay of Pokémon">
Gameplay of Pokémon

The gameplay of the Pokémon series of role-playing video games involves the capture and training of a variety of fictional creatures called "Pokémon" and using them to battle other trainers. Each successive generation of games builds upon this concept by introducing new Pokémon, items, and gameplay concepts. Some of the general concepts were featured elsewhere before being introduced in the games; double battles appeared in the anime long before appearing in the games, and Pokémon abilities are similar to the Pokémon Powers introduced in the "Pokémon Trading Card Game".

Battling is a large part of the games. Pokémon can be found in the wild, in dark grass, caves, forests, ponds, the ocean, and even underwater. Also, whenever the player walks in front of another trainer, they must battle. Hundreds of trainers are in each of the main series "Pokémon" games.

Pokémon have six statistics (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) which all affect how they perform in battles. Statistics can be raised by using items and by training the Pokémon.

Before "Pokémon Gold and Silver" were released, the "Special Attack" and "Special Defense" stats were combined into one statistic, "Special." This later became too complicated so it was divided into "Special Attack" and "Special Defense."

Starting in "Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire", Pokémon have abilities which affect them in various ways. These can be abilities that work while in battle or when the player is just walking around. An example is the ability "Oblivious", which prevents the Pokémon from becoming "attracted" to Pokémon of the opposite gender that use the move Attract.

Each Pokémon has either one or two types. Which types it has affect how it performs when it battles other Pokémon of other types. For example, a Fire-type Pokémon is at a disadvantage to a Water-type, but has a large advantage against a Grass-type. It could be compared to a more complex game of rock-paper-scissors.

This is a list of the types:

And two more were added when "Pokémon Gold and Silver" were released:

Pokémon Gyms are buildings where the player faces a Gym Leader, who focuses one of the 17 types of Pokémon. There are also trainers in the Gym that the player can battle, and they also use mostly that type. Beating the Gym Leader earns you a Badge which increases your skills.

Pokémon evolve to turn into different Pokémon from the same evolutionary line. Doing so, they become stronger and can learn more powerful moves, but learn moves at higher levels.

This is the most common of the ways that Pokémon evolve. Pokémon in this category evolve when they reach a certain level. 
Some Pokemon can only evolve by level in a certain place.

This is another way that Pokémon evolve. Some Pokémon can only evolve if they are given certain evolution stones.

This is another way that Pokémon evolve. Some Pokémon only evolve if they are traded to a friend. 
Some Pokémon only evolve if traded to a friend while holding an item.

Another way Pokémon evolve is through happiness. Whenever the player character in the game walks 1,000 steps, gives their Pokémon a vitamin such as Protein, Iron, Carbos, Calcium, or Zinc, training it until it gains a level, or when the character does something else to make it happy, it will gain happiness points. The item Soothe Bell multiplies this amount. Once a Pokémon has reached a certain happiness level, it will evolve after it is leveled once, sometimes depending on the time of day:

Example: Eevee evolves into either Espeon or Umbreon if its happiness rating is maxed out; into Espeon if this happens during the day, or Umbreon if it happens during the night. However, such day-and-night distinction exists only in the second- and fourth-generation games.

Pokémon can evolve after learning certain moves and leveling up.


A large number of different items exist. They are used to help the player or their Pokémon.

A Poké Ball is a red-and-white sphere that is used to catch Pokémon. Many different forms of it exist, like the Great Ball, the Ultra Ball, the Heavy Ball, the Net Ball, the Dive Ball, the Friend Ball, and the Master Ball (which can catch any Pokémon without fail). Each of these are different colors.

The Pokédex is a tool used by Pokémon trainers all around the Pokémon world in different regions. These regions include the Unova region, the Sinnoh region, the Hoenn region, the Johto region and the Kanto region. The Pokédex makes records of information about each of the different Pokémon. There are 649 different species of Pokémon recorded in the world today. Different Pokémon are caught in different regions and some Pokémon can only be caught in certain regions, such as Dialga in the Sinnoh Region. 

Legendary Pokémon are Pokémon that are very rare, and there is usually only one in each game. Examples of legendaries are Articuno, Mewtwo, Mew, Lugia, Groudon, and Dialga. They are hard to catch, and are stronger than most Pokémon. Some roam around, while others can be found in one spot until you KO or capture them. If you KO a legendary it will usually leave and will never be found again unless the game is restarted. Because of this, players usually save before engaging the Pokémon.

Shiny Pokémon are a different color than that Pokémon normal for their species. An example would be a yellow Bulbasaur (they are usually greenish-blue). They are extremely rare; there is only a 1 in 8,192 chance of an encountered Pokémon being shiny.

The player controls Kyle Katarn, who was once a stormtrooper for the Galactic Empire but left the Empire to become a mercenary. In "Dark Forces", Katarn works for the Rebellion which fights against the Empire. The game's story is about Kyle finding and stopping an Imperial weapons program called the Dark Trooper Project.

Everything in the game is set in the Star Wars universe. Many things in the game are taken from the original Star Wars trilogy movies, such as several weapons and most of the game's enemies, but some things were made just for "Dark Forces". 

Many of the planets that the levels take place on were created for Dark Forces, but a few of them are from "Star Wars" books. 

"Dark Forces" is a first person shooter, so the player controls Katarn and sees from Katarn's eyes. Much of the gameplay is about fighting and shooting enemies, but there are also many puzzles to solve to move through the missions. 

The player can run, strafe, jump, crouch, and move through shallow water. The player can also look up and down. The game can be controlled with keys on the keyboard, and also a mouse can be used to run, turn, and shoot. 

The game is made up of separate missions. Each mission has certain goals that the player must finish. The missions are all part of the story. Katarn's pilot drops him off and picks him up, but he goes through the missions alone without any help.

There are many different weapons in the game that the player can use and that enemies also use. Most of the weapons shoot blaster bolts or other projectiles, but the player can also throw "thermal detonators" like grenades. Some of the weapons have a "secondary" fire mode which shoots in a different way.

The story is told in two ways. One way is cutscenes, which are animated videos that play between some missions. Also, before each mission the player is given a briefing which talks about what is happening in the story and what the mission goals are.

In the first mission, Katarn steals the Death Star plans so the Rebels can destroy the Death Star. The rest of the game is a different story. 

The Rebels find out about a secret Imperial program called the Dark Trooper Project. The Dark Trooper project is a plot to create new robotic Stormtroopers that are very powerful and dangerous.

Kyle searches for clues about the Dark Trooper Project and sets off to stop it.

National Day Parade, 2009

The National Day Parade 2009 (NDP 2009) was a national ceremony held on 9 August 2009 at The Float at Marina Bay to commemorate Singapore's 44th year of independence. For the third time, the event was held in the Marina Bay area.

The NDP 2009 Logo depicts a stylised hand reaching out to Singaporeans of different backgrounds, connecting all as one united people. A motif of the heart on the palm of the hand embodies people's compassion and care for their citizens. 

The five stars forming the fingers symbolise democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality in vibrant colours reflecting the nation's diversity. Reaching up in celebration of progress as a nation, the shooting stars represent people's hope for a better future.

The theme for NDP 09, "Come Together – Reaching Out, Reaching Up" is inspired by the Singapore National Pledge. It is about Singaporeans "coming together" as "one united people", to "reach out" to all Singaporeans regardless of "race, language or religion", and to "reach up" towards our hopes and aspirations articulated when we pledge to "achieve happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation".

Gresham's law is commonly written: "Bad money drives out good."

When there are two forms of money used in trade, and the government forces them both to trade for the same value, if people desire one ("good" money) more than the other ("bad" money), they will always offer the bad money in trade before the good money. Over time, the good money will be kept in pocket, and only the bad money will be found in the market.

Wikipedia:Deletion review/Category:Lists of rivers in Romania

Request for deletion: 

Hello there. Unlike the asteroid stubs, all of the rivers that you deleted were all inherently notable according to the English Wikipedia. Therefore, I would like to request that All of the Romanian Rivers be undeleted, as well as a bunch of other pages that were not rivers that also got deleted. I was shocked that nobody even though to let me know via email that the Romanian River pages were up for deletion. I didn't even know that they were deleted until I just happened upon it whilst looking through the "Show any page" option on the left hand side of the screen. I just want to say that I am extremely upset that you guys found it necessary to delete pretty much all of the articles that I made for you. It is like kicking someone that is down. You are making me rethink my decision to come back to this site now. There are a number of pages which are definitely notable, including Suceava River, Moldova River, Prahova River, Siret River, and a bunch of other "major tributaries" that you guys just decided did not need to be put onto this Wikipedia. Why did you even bother deleting them if they were already made in the first place? They are going to need to be recreated at some point further down the road, so why not just leave them undeleted so that they are there for when we start needing articles for all the rivers of every country around the world. Rivers and other geographical places have inherent notability according to the notability guidelines on the English Wikipedia that says that things in which are places on the world are inherently notable because they are important because you may need to know all about them. They are an important part of an encyclopedia, so without them, you are kind of like cutting out a portion of editors to this site. I thought that the idea of the Simple English Wikipedia was to make an encyclopedia by writing articles in your interests. Geography is my interest, and I love Romania, so I definitely think that these should all be undeleted. This, in my opinion, was done behind my back (you waited until I retired and then put them all up for deletion. If I had still been on here, you would not have gotten the same vote for the request for deletion. I definitely believe that they are an integral part of this Wikipedia; much more so than the asteroids. I could care less about the asteroids, but when you mess with the Romanian Rivers, I get pissed off. I would like to request that the vote be redone and/or all of the articles undeleted. Thanks, 03:56, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

I ask that very serious consideration and discussion be given to this request. Unlike the asteroid RFD, Razorflame was not informed of the Romanian rivers RFD since he had officially retired from the project. It must be very disheartening for any editor to have much of his work deleted from a project and I think we should seriously enter into a discussion about articles that enWP would consider notable even if they were small stubs. 04:12, 9 August 2009 (UTC)








Ok guys, I understand that they should be deleted now. However, I would like to request the undeletion of the numerous lists of rivers that Creol and I made. Could we possibly discuss the restoration of the List of rivers in Romania and all of its' subpages please? Thanks, 17:49, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

This request will close seven days after it was opened; this will be around. Sunday, 23 August 2009 at 05:00 (UTC), although it may be closed quicker because of .<br><br>
Well, I thought about it. This RFU will be closed as unsuccessful. This means: The pages (includes all the deleted rivers, templates with redlinks only and lists with redlinks only) will not be restored. The template which is mentioned above, links only to lists. The lists themselves include only or to over 90% redlinks. Therefore, I think it is useless to restore them. Above is also no concensus for restore any of the deleted pages. There were some examptions I made a few weeks ago, when I restored a few rivers, which were needed for our VGA Romania. At all, only pages/rivers, which are needed on such important pages will be restored (e.g. per request on my talk). -- || 12:28, 24 August 2009 (UTC)

Quickie (sex)

A quickie is a brief act of sexual intercourse.

People will not usually engage in much foreplay with a quickie. The phrase is often used between regular partners to say that they wish to have sex, but cannot spend a great deal of time over it. 

A quickie may not always mean copulation. It may be only be oral sex or mutual masturbation. According to some, a quickie between a heterosexual couple generally satisfies only the man's desire. Others claim that quickies (with intercourse or some other form of stimulation of the vulva) can be "a major turn-on" for a woman, too, but still may not give a woman enough time to lubricate naturally, and so require the use of a water-based lubricant. Some consider quickies a solution to unequal sexual desire in a relationship, but if they become the only form of sex, the relationship may suffer.
For gay men, a quickie sometimes means casual sex, like a hand job. It does not usually happen with lesbians, however.

<doc id="194329" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194329" title="Deep-throating">
Deep-throating

Deep throating is a form of fellatio, when all of a erect penis is placed inside a man or woman's mouth. The penis will enter the throat. The person whose penis is inserted is normally referred as the receiving partner, and the person who performs deep-throating is referred to as the giving partner.
It is difficult for most people to perform deep-throating, because the natural gag reflex that happens when the soft palate is touched. Different people have different sensitivities to the reflex, but some people learn to suppress the reflex. 

Usually, the giving partner's tongue is immobilized during deep-throating and they also are not able to suck.

The position of both partners is important in performing deep throat. For deep-throating, the giving partner's mouth and throat will need to be aligned (made into) into a straight line, and he or she will need to respiration through the nose. It is important for the giving partner to be in a position to control any pelvic thrust during deep-throating, to be able to pull the penis out if needed; and for the receiving partner not to thrust, as during irrumatio.

"Over-the-edge" is a common position for deep-throating. In this position, the giving partner lays on his/her back with the head hanging off the edge of the bed and the receiving partner stands or places himself on his knees in front of the giving partner, with his penis at the giving partner's mouth.

Another position used for deep-throating involves the giving partner sitting on the receiving partner's chest, with his feet or penis in front of the giving partner. 

The 69 position is another position for deep-throating.

Bondage (BDSM)

Bondage is the use of items like handcuffs, ropes or chains to restrain a willing person for sexual pleasure. Bondage often has to do with sex, but not always.

Bondage often has to do with BDSM. The word may also be used by itself, as in the case of rope bondage and bondage of the female breasts.

Some couples include bondage as foreplay in their otherwise traditional sex lives at some time during their relationship. These Bedroom bondage games are often with one partner willingly being restrained with rope or cuffs. Sometimes they can also be blindfolded or gagged.

Chalcedonian Creed

The Chalcedonian Creed is a creed which was made during the Council of Chalcedon in the year 451. This council is one of the seven ecumenical councils. It is recognised by the Eastern Orthodox, the Catholics, and by many Protestant Churches. It is the first council the Oriental Orthodox Church does not not recognize. 

The Chalcedonian creed was written during a controversy between the Western and Eastern Churches. They could not agree about the meaning of Incarnation, the influence of the emperor in the church, and the role of the Roman Pope. The Western Churches had no problems accepting the creed, but some Eastern Churches had.

The creed became doctrine in the Orthodox Church. The Coptic church of Alexandria disagreed. They used Cyril's formula instead. They said that the creed should say that Christ be acknowledged "from two natures" rather than "in two natures".

Kyneton is a town in central Victoria, Australia. In 2006 there were 5,905 people living in Kyneton.

Piper Street is the oldest street and still has many of its old buildings. 

The town is the centre for the local government area, the Shire of Macedon Ranges. 

Kyneton is famous for its springs, the Campaspe River, public gardens and old houses, many built from stone. Kyneton has several events during the year including the ANZAC Day parade, the Kyneton Jazz Festival, Kyneton Daffodil Festival, Kyneton Agricultural show and the Kyneton Cup (horse racing). The famous bushranger, Ned Kelly, was put on trial in the Kyneton Courthouse in 1870 for robbery. This courthouse is still in use.

The first European to explore the Kyneton area was Major Thomas Mitchell who crossed and named the Campaspe River in 1836. The first settlers came to Kyneton later that year.

Kyneton is different from other towns in the area as it was settled in 1850, a year before the gold rushes started. It was a farming area which became an important stop for those people going to the gold rushes at Mount Alexander and Bendigo. The post office opened on 1 July 1843, as Mount Macedon, but was renamed Kyneton on 1 January 1854.

Kyneton has its own newspaper, the "Midland Express", which also serves Castlemaine.

<doc id="194396" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194396" title="Lucario">
Lucario

Lucario is a character of the Pokémon anime and video game series. Known as the Aura Pokémon, it has the ability to feel the Auras of all things. It is a Fighting and Steel Pokémon. It is seen in the games "Pokémon Diamond and Pearl", and in the movie "Lucario and the Mystery of Mew". In an interview with "Pokémon Diamond and Pearl" director Junichi Masuda, he noted Lucario's name as one of the hardest to make, because they wanted to make it work for both the Japanese and Americans.

Lucario is a jackal-like Pokémon that's around four feet in height. Lucario's hands are black and have one white spike on each arm on the top of its wrists, and there's a third spike on Lucario's chest. Lucario's nose and ears are longer since it evolved from Riolu. Lucario has a furry yellow body, and its hips are in the shape of what looks like blue shorts. It has the ability to sense the aura in all living things, and can use telepathic human speech. By catching the Aura coming from others, it can read their thoughts. A well-trained one can sense auras of creatures over half a mile away.

Lucario is a Pokémon that appears in the Nintendo DS versions of "Pokémon Diamond and Pearl"; Lucario is used by Maylene, the third Sinnoh Gym Leader, a tag-team partner known as Riley, and by Cynthia, Sinnoh's Elite Four Champion. In "Pokémon Mystery Dungeon" Lucario is seen as the greatest rescue leader of all time, and earning 15,000 Rescue Points will put the player in the top rank - the Lucario rank - and the Lucario statue will be put outside the rescue base.

It is a fighter in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and uses attacks like Aura Sphere, Force Palm, ExtremeSpeed, Double Team, and its final smash, Aura Storm. Lucario was confirmed to be a playable character in "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" due to a leak. After seeing their mistake they quickly fixed it. Lucario and Jigglypuff can no longer be seen but there are many YouTube videos which show proof of the leak, as well as screen shots. 

Lucario's main role in the anime is his appearance in the eighth Pokémon movie, "Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew". In the movie, Lucario is a servant to Sir Aaron in a Renaissance-themed city called Cameron Palace. Aaron had trained this Lucario to use aura. Lucario thinks of Sir Aaron as both his master and close friend. After Aaron traps him in a magic staff at the film's start, Lucario begins questioning any Pokémon-human relationship. The Lucario in the movie, can also speak human languages without psychic powers. Lucario sacrificed himself in order to save the Tree of Beginning, though the credits showed him with Sir Aaron eating a chocolate bar.

Maylene in the anime, like in the games, has a Lucario and it was seen in four episodes. It was first seen battling with Maylene in their training. Lucario used Aura Sphere to stop the battle of Electabuzz, Piplup, and Pikachu, and is seen battling Paul's Pokémon in a flashback. Lucario was seen again where it battled in Dawn's gym battle with Maylene, where it defeated Dawn's Ambipom and Piplup. Then, in the next episode, it battled in Ash's gym battle against Maylene. It defeated Ash's Staravia and Chimchar, but was knocked out along with Ash's Buizel, which ended in a tie. Finaly, Lucario was seen when it helped Ash and the others defeat Saturn and Team Galactic.

In the Pokémon Adventures manga, like in games, it appears under the ownership of Riley who was on a boat heading to the Battle Frontier. Diamond meets Riley at Iron Island, and Byron asks Riley to help Diamond sharpen his Pokémon battle skills before Diamond goes to Lake Verity. In "Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Adventure!" the main character, Hareta, gained a Riolu egg which hatched into a Riolu later on in that chapter and then evolved in to Lucario.

UGO described Lucario as "a new breed of Pokémon, with a cooler, more dangerous look. It's quick and possesses a damaging set of attacks", yet called it lame due to its status as a Pokémon. IGN called its presence in "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" "a bit on the head scratching side" in light of more familiar characters in the title such as Pikachu. Although another editor stated that it would make sense for "Pokémon" to be represented by a fighting-type Pokémon, since "Super Smash Bros Brawl" is a fighting game. GamesRadar described it as an "all-around bad-ass" and "the Bruce Lee of Pokémon", suggesting its design as similar to the Egyptian God Anubis. Beckett "Pokémon" Unofficial Collector editor Sean Cooper stated that Lucario had grown popular in recent years due to his starring role in "Lucario and the Mystery of Mew" and his appearance in "Super Smash Bros. Brawl".

Hertzsprung-Russell diagram

The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is a graph of many stars. It shows the relation between stars' luminosity (that is, how bright they are) and their temperature (how hot they are). These diagrams are not pictures or maps of the locations of the stars. Rather, Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams plot each star on a graph measuring the star's brightness versus its temperature. Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams are also called H-R diagrams or HRDs.

You can see an example of a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to the right. This diagram is based on measurements from 23,000 stars in our Milky Way galaxy. The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is named after its creators, astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell.

The vertical axis of a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram shows the luminosity or brightness of the stars, as if they were all measured from the same distance. Another term for this is absolute magnitude. The brighter a star is, the higher its plot will be on this chart.

The horizontal axis shows the surface temperature of the stars. However, the temperatures go "down", not up, as you move to the right. That is, the left of the diagram contains stars with the highest temperature plots (greater than 30,000 Kelvins) while the right shows stars with temperatures of only 3000K.

In general, the temperature of a star relates to its color. At the top of the chart, along with the temperatures, are the Spectral Classes. The hottest stars are blue-white (class O), those in the middle temperatures are yellow (class G) and the coolest ones are red (class M). (Of course, when we say "coolest" about stars, we must realize that the lowest temperature for a star is almost 5000 degrees Fahrenheit.)

As a matter of fact, when Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams were developed in the early 1900's, astronomers did not know how to find out the temperature of a star. The first diagrams plotted stars' absolute magnitude (where "adding" one meant the brightness would go "down" by about two and a half times) against color, represented by the spectral classes from blue-white to red. 

As you can see, stars tend to fall only into certain regions of the diagram when graphed in this way. All stars in a given area of a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram share similar luminosities and temperatures. The main region where stars appear is the diagonal curved line, going from the upper-left (hot and bright) to the lower-right (cooler and less bright). This is called the Main Sequence. Above the main sequence is another region containing the red giants. Below is a curved line representing the white dwarfs.

These collections of stars by brightness and temperature are important when talking about stellar evolution. In general, stars are created in the main sequence. (Of course, when we say ""in" the main sequence" we really mean "having a brightness and a temperature that causes them to be plotted within the main sequence on a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.") After billions of years, they expand into red giants. Then, after another one or two billion years, they shrink into white dwarfs.

It was only in the 1930's and 1940's that scientists began to understand the role of nuclear fusion in creating and keeping stars like our sun. These days Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams are used to present stellar evolution in pictures to students. They're not used much any more for developing new scientific theories.

On a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, our Sun is plotted very close to the middle of the main sequence at the intersection of luminosity 1 and temperature 5780K. Therefore, the sun is class G or a "yellow star").

Hi all! Bobby Robson died today. This article is one of our VGAs. The system how we get the today's selected article is a random choice. I suggest, that our wiki should be up to date. So far, the article should be tomorrow's VGA of the day. If the random choice fail (means not Bobby is on the main page), would it be great if someone can fix it at 00:00 UTC. I am not here at this time. Thanks -- || 15:22, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

We need help, and some outside comments please at . Thank you, () 17:00, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

I'd like to see what everyone's opinion on usernames ( etc.) is. Today was created and blocked. This wouldn't have happened if J.K. didn't write her books ten years ago, of course, although besides that we might have lost a potential contributor, and I don't think this wiki much affords that.

Simply because it has an affiliation, or possibly due to their liking the whole merchandise doesn't necessarily mean they're inherently evil or anything, right? And besides the very notions of morality, what's the use of blocking anyone without even seeing what their edits are like? I think vandals have more lenient treatment with all the warnings etc... so why can't we be more rational in this regard as well? -- 12:25, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

Strange. There's a User:Harrypotter on enwiki who has been editing for years. Very poor block indeed. 14:11, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

Why are a lot of candidates (for CU/OS mostly) stating their offline credentials (to 'impress', perhaps) when it has no real bearing and ultimately unverified? I thought we always judged one's contributions, and not whether they've progressed in the outside world. -- 14:12, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

Hello all,

yesterday I talked with who is the editor of . Wikizine is published almost every week. It is about different things that are interesting to all Wikipedias. Anyway, our Wikipedia is mentioned in the current edition. I hope that we get more editors by this. Just wanted to let you know. -- () 07:16, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

Hello there,

An successful oversight candidate will need to fulfill the criteria set by the foundation (which are the same as those for CheckUsers):

In addition, they will need at lest 25 support votes; given that these represent about 80% of the votes (meaning 20% of the voters oppose), this means 32 total votes. At 25% oppose, we are at 33 total votes, with 30% oppose at 35. What I am trying to say here is that even 32 votes is an awful lot for a community as small as ours.

The idea would therefore be to lengthen the time in which voting would be possible (from one week, per our ) to two, or perhaps even three weeks. Note that we can do this, and it is probably unproblematic, as long as it is a decision taken by the community as a whole, before the start of the vote. We need to do this, leaving the vote open "indefinitely", that is to say until a consensus has formed is not a good option. The people running need to know that at some point in time they either failed, or are promoted. 

Since the people elected will serve this community, I would also like to propose that only people who are active here take part in the vote. Even if this makes getting the 32 votes more difficult, it will be better for our credibility.

Lastly, we should do this election only after the "summer break", ie. when the universities have started again; getting 32 voters will be hard enough, even then. -- () 07:51, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

I have just been editing of the enwiki and using the reftool they have available in their list of gadgets. Does anyone know how we could have that tool added here? -- () 13:07, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

Hey,

I am just here to bring up the issue of how many editors are being given the bureaucrats, oversighters and checkuser tools. I don't want to bring this up on the RFA page as it is not a discussion for there. I am going to support the users at RFA currently because I can trust them, but I am not sure if we need that many people in the posts that these editors wish to occupy. What are your thoughts here?-- |  00:27, 10 August 2009 (UTC)
(<-) This Wikipedia currently has about forty regular (high-volume) contributors. Of these, roughly thirty have the "admin" flag, and are active among these "high-volume contributors" (forty admins total, some inactive). We currently have seven people with the "bureaucrat" flag, and three with the "CheckUser" flag. Six people are currently running for "Oversight" privileges. I am not concerned about these numbers, but I think what we would need most is more editors:

I will go a step further, and ask: Look at what the admins did in the last half year. How many admins could simply do with the status of "regular user", and a "rollback" privilege? - Look at other wikipedias, and compare the number of regular, high-volume users they have to the number of "administrators" (including crats, cu's, ..oversighters..). 

When a bureaucrat and checkuser left at the beginning of this year, this brought weeks of re-electing new checkusers; with the drama that followed. It was my decision to make more people into bureaucrats (and checkusers), so that this situation would not repeat. That said, I would look forward to us getting at least three overighters. That way, we are not pressed to re-elect one, because we are below the number of people in a certain position. These are of course just my thoughts. 

Technically, given the current numbers, we could do with about four admins, two bureaucrats, two checkusers, and two oversighters. Note also that we require our crats, checkusers and oversighers to be admins, other Wikipedias do not have this requirement.

I hope this answers the question. -- () 09:13, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

Pages like 4 (number), 5 (number), 66 (number), 72 (number), 24 (number), 12 (number), 54 (number), 56 (number) seem useless to me. Wouldn't it be better to redirect most of them (except 1 (number) and others like that) to Number and expand that article? It would eliminate quite a few stubs. Same for years. Couldn't we merge years of the same century into articles and redirect each year? 13:52, 12 August 2009 (UTC)

Hello there,

@ChenzW: Eptalon agrees with six months and so do some other admins (check the current RfDA). So consensus isn't against me (not yet). () 16:28, 13 August 2009 (UTC)

Hell, I think writing articles is a fun thing to do. If that's too boring, making existing articles better is also a fun thing to do. What do you others think? -- () 20:10, 13 August 2009 (UTC)

Note that I'll be working on importing over the next couple days. Simplifying user warnings and such is still to come. – |  20:32, 13 August 2009 (UTC)

I would propose that all "crat chats" regarding any on hold RFA occur on wiki, on the RFA talk page:



Best, () 22:47, 12 August 2009 (UTC)

I've noticed that most articles here on Simple don't have talk pages. Earlier this morning I created to put at the top of every article talk (much like on en). I went ahead and put the template on the talk of the articles I have created but it's not feasible for one person to template every talk page. Plus it would wreak havoc on my edit count. I was talking with on IRC tonight and he said that he could code a bot to do this if there's consensus for it here. So, my question to you all is: what do you think, do you think that this is a good idea? Cheers, →javért 07:56, 15 August 2009 (UTC)
Assuming my calculations are correct the bot will edit about 23125 pages. At an edit rate of about 9-12 edits per min the bot should be done in about a day and a half. -- 10:29, 15 August 2009 (UTC)

Seabirds are birds that have adapted so they are better able to live at sea or near it. Many seabirds live "at sea", that is, far away from land. They may only come on land to breed. Other seabirds live in colonies on islands. Very often, seabirds use the sea to for food, most often fish or shellfish.

<doc id="194440" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194440" title="Tropical Depression One (2009)">
Tropical Depression One (2009)

Tropical Depression One was the first tropical cyclone of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season. It was also the third tropical cyclone since 2007 to form before June 1. The storm formed on May 28, and moved across the Atlantic Ocean. Later that day, the storm started to weaken and fall apart. On May 29, the storm died and became a remnant low.

Before the storm became a depression, some parts of the storm brought light rainfall to the eastern tip of North Carolina. However there were no damages or deaths reported. Also the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not give out any tropical storm watches or warnings for the storm.

During mid-May, a disorganized low pressure area formed in the Atlantic Ocean about 290 miles (465 kilometers) south-southwest of Wilmington, North Carolina. The low pressure moved north and started to become more organized. On May 27, the storm was 120 miles (195 km) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina when the National Hurricane Center (NHC) decided to start monitoring the storm. A high pressure area that was located southeast of the storm pushed it into a northeast direction. Then on 8 pm EDT (0000 UTC on May 28), the NHC stopped monitoring the storm, as the low was not expected to strengthen anymore. 

On May 28, the NHC started to monitor the storm again and on 11:00 am EDT (1500 UTC), they declared the storm to be a tropical cyclone and named it Tropical Depression One. At that time, the storm's location was about 310 mi (500 km) south of Providence, Rhode Island. After it was named as a depression, the storm showed deep convection and the center of circulation was at the northwestern part of the storm. The reason why the depression restrengthened was because of lower wind shear and warmer ocean waters from the Gulf Stream. Later that day, the depression started to weaken when it moved into an area with higher wind shear and colder ocean waters. Around 7:30 pm EDT (2330 UTC), a QuikSCAT satellite flew over the depression and found tropical storm-force winds. But the NHC thought the depression didn't strengthen and that winds were affected by rain. After the satellite passed over the depression, the center of circulation moved closer to the northwest edge of the storm and convection started to decrease.
On May 29, the depression almost became a tropical storm, when the storm's strength was measured at T2.5, or 40 mph (65 km/h) using the Dvorak technique. But some of the measurements were also low as T1.5, which was the reason why the NHC didn't call it a tropical storm. After a quick burst of convection during the night, thunderstorm clouds inside the depression started to disappear by 3:00 am EDT (0700 UTC). By then, the tropical depression was no longer expected to strength anymore and was forecasted to weaken. A few hours later, the center of circulation was ripped apart by strong wind shear while a nearby trough also started to absorb the rest of the storm. With no convection around the center of the storm, it became a remnant low during the afternoon. At 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC), the NHC gave out its last advisory on Tropical Depression One. The remains of the storm were later taken in by a warm front around 2 am EDT (0600 UTC).

On May 27 the cyclone brought some light rainfall to parts of coastal North Carolina before it was called Tropical Depression One. Hatteras, North Carolina saw 0.1 in (2.5 mm) of rainfall and wind speeds up to 15 mph (24 km/h) with gusts to 23 mph (37 km/h). The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded from the storm was 1009 mbar (hPa; 29.81 inHg).

When the storm became Tropical Depression One on May 28, it was the third time since 1851 that an Atlantic tropical cyclone formed before June 1, the official start of an Atlantic hurricane season. The depression followed Subtropical Storm Andrea of May 2007 and Tropical Storm Arthur of May 2008. The first time this event happened was in 1932, 1933, and 1934; the second time it happened was in 1951, 1952, and 1953. The National Hurricane Center also reported that Tropical Depression One was also the farthest north a May tropical cyclone has ever formed.

Absolute temperature

Absolute temperature is the temperature of an object on a scale where 0 is taken as absolute zero. The unit of absolute temperature is the Kelvin, which is the same as the degree Celcius used in the Celsius temperature scale.

Common temperatures in the absolute scale are:

To convert from the Celsius scale into the absolute temperature, you add 273.15 and change °C to K. To get a temperature on the absolute scale to the Celsius scale, subtract 273.15 and change K to °C.
This is normally used in the science world.

Monas

Monas or National Monument (Indonesia: Monumen Nasional) is a 450 ft tall monument in Jakarta, Indonesia. It represents the spirit of the Indonesians to fight for their independence. The construction began at 1961 under Soekarno and was finished at 1975 under Soeharto's reign. It was made of marble with the top consisting of a 14.5 tons flame-shaped bronze coated with 35 kilograms of gold.

This monument has several museums such as The Freedom Hall and the Hall of Contemplation. The Freedom Hall tells the story about the struggle of Indonesians for their freedom while the Hall of Contemplation displays the Declaration of Independence and the recording of the speech. Inside there are lifts to the observation platform where one can see a bird's eye-view of the city of Jakarta. The size of the platform is 11x11 and has the capability to hold up to 50 peoples.

Those who are coming to Monas, can come in via the entrance around the Medan Merdeka Park Plaza, at the Northern area of Monas. In that area there is a fountain and a statue of Prince Diponegoro riding a horse. This statue is made of 8 ton bronze sculpted by Italian artist Prof. Coberlato. 

The admission to enter the halls are free. The lift to go to the top, however, costs 5,100 Rupiahs for adult and 2,600 Rupiahs for children.

Trust (social sciences)

Trust is a feeling that somebody or something can be relied upon, or will turn out to be good. It is the feeling of being sure about something, even if it cannot be proved. 

The word "trust" can be a noun or a verb:


There is also an adjective: trusting.

One can also trust a thing:


To "trust" often means: to feel confident that something will or has happened:

In religion, trust can be similar to faith. Someone who believes in a god will put their trust in their god.

To "trust" (or "entrust") can be used in other ways:

Trusting does not necessarily mean that the person or thing that is trusted is good. Two criminals might be friends and they might trust one another, but what they trust one another to do is bad (although it might seem good to them).

Being trusting without thinking carefully about it might be dangerous. People can sometimes win someone’s trust, but then they might break their trust.

The opposite of “trusting” is “mistrust” (“to have no trust in”). This is similar to the word “suspicious”.

Someone who is untrustworthy is someone who cannot be trusted.

To “take something on trust” means: to trust something without looking at it carefully.

Hinche

Hinche (Kréyòl: "Ench" is a city in the centre of Haiti. It is the capital city of the Centre "Département".

The city is in the region called "Plateau Central" about 100 km northeast of Port-au-Prince. It is also the chief town of an "arrondissement" (a part of a department) with the same name. The "arrondissement" has four "communes" (a "commune" is like a municipality): Hinche, Cerca-Cavajal (Kreyòl: "Sèka Kavajal"), Maïssade (Kreyòl: "Mayisad") and Thomonde (Kreyòl: "Tomonn").

Hinche is on the southern limit of the Plateau Central, a long valley between the "Massif du Nord", to the north, and the "Montagne Noire", to the south.

The city is on the right side of the River Guayamouc, a tributary of the River Artibonite.

The city was founded in 1704 with families that came from the Canary Islands; it took the Taíno name of the region: "Hincha". The French people changed the name to Hinche but in Spanish it is still Hincha. At that moment, the region was part of the Spanish colony of "Santo Domingo" (now the Dominican Republic).

After the Haitian Revolution, in the early 19th century, this region became part of the new Republic of Haiti but the Dominican Republic accepted the transfer of the region to Haiti only in 1929.

"Bassin Zim", to the east of Hinche, is a beautiful 20 m waterfall, a 30-minute drive from town.

 Hello there all. This is my seventh editor review, and I definitely feel like I could use another one since my last editor review was back in January of this year. Basically, I will make this a short request: Please tell me what I do right and what I do wrong in a constructive way so that I can modify these behaviors to make me a better editor here on the Simple English Wikipedia. Since coming back from my extended Wikibreak, I feel that I have come back a changed editor, as is evidenced by my recent acceptance of the deletion of a good 80% of the article work that I have done here on the Simple English Wikipedia. Those two RfDs have changed my perspective of things here on the Simple English Wikipedia, and I definitely believe that it is a positive change for the better. Please let me know how I am doing :).

Diponegoro

Diponegoro was a Javanese prince who opposed the Dutch rule in Indonesia. He was the eldest son of Sultan 
Hamengkubowono III. Diponegoro was born at Yogyakarta in 1785 and passed away at Makassar in 1855. During the Dutch rule, a ruler like his father had lost many rights such as the ability to lease land. Instead, he was paid by the Dutch to keep peace. This was an indignity to his father. This led to an open battle headed by Diponegoro himself using guerrilla tactics, which was called the Java War. It lasted for five years, from 1825 until 1830. During that period Diponegoro had successfully led battles, ambushing Dutch camps and raiding food supplies. Over the period of five years, more than 200,000 people were dead because of the war. In 1830, he was sent away by the Dutch to Manado, then moved to Ujungpandang, and he spent the rest of his life there. After being held by the Dutch in Fort Rotterdam in Ujungpandang for 25 years, he passed away there in 1855.

Star Wars: Jedi Knight (series)

The Jedi Knight series is a series of games made by Lucasarts. The games are all first-person shooters. They follow the story of the mercenary and later Jedi Kyle Katarn. The player controls Katarn in all of the games except "Jedi Academy".

The games are mostly about fighting. They have lots of shooting combat where the player fights enemies with blasters and other weapons that shoot projectiles. Starting in Jedi Knight, Kyle begins to learn The Force and gets a lightsaber, which is a type of sword made out of energy. When Katarn uses the lightsaber, the game can go into third-person mode where the camera follows Katarn from behind so the player can see Katarn fighting with his lightsaber. Once Katarn learns the Force he starts to be able to use Force powers to do things like push people and heal himself.

Projectile

A projectile is something that is sent flying through the air, usually as a weapon. Any solid object that is thrown or fired out of something is a projectile. For example, an arrow fired from a bow, a bullet, or even a rock from a slingshot are all projectiles.

Projectile weapons have been used for a long time. Bows and slingshots are very old weapons that were used hundreds of years ago. Now most countries use projectile weapons instead of melee weapons like swords. This is because modern projectile weapons such as guns, rocket launchers, and artillery cannons can shoot at long ranges and are usually more deadly than melee weapons.

Millionaires

Millionaires is an American electronic trio from Los Angeles, California. It was started in 2007 by three girls, Melissa Marie Green, Allison Green, and Dani Artaud. They are very popular on MySpace. The girls are notable for their mostly negative reaction from other people. They also performed one show for the TV show Double Shot at Love with the Ikki Twins.

Millionaires started in August 2007, when Melissa Marie and Allison made a song on their new laptop with GarageBand. They named the song "I Like Money", and decided they needed a name for themselves to make a MySpace profile for the song. Melissa Marie and Allison decided on Millionaires, to go with the name of the song. Soon after, Dani came in the mix, and they made their second song, "Hoe Down."

After a few months, they began to perform shows locally and traveled only small distances for shows. They got spots in music festivals such as Rockin Roots,Bamboozle Left 2008,and Audio Overload 2008. By July 2008, they were ready to tour and they went out on their first tour co-headlining with another band, Breathe Carolina across the West coast. Later in July, they headlined the GET F$CKED UP tour.

In July 2008, they performed on MTV's TRL as part of On The Radar, a show where popular bands not signed to a record label perform. The girls returned in January and February 2009 on their Just Got Paid, Let's Get Laid tour, which sold out every date. They made a short song titled "Ooh Uh Huh", which became the theme song for MTV's reality show "A Double Shot At Love" with the Ikki twins. Their song "Hey Rich Boy" was also used as the theme for MTV's Teen Cribs.

Before Millionaires were to release their second EP, "Just Got Paid, Let's Get Laid", it was rumored that the Millionaires were signed to Decaydance after Gabe Saprota from Cobra Starship convinved Pete Wentz to sign them on to the label. Later Wentz sent a message saying that Millionaires were not signed to Decaydance, and that Crush management had asked them to produce hard copies of their EP.

Heckler &amp; Koch MP5

The MP5 is a submachine gun made by Heckler & Koch. It is one of the most popular submachine guns in the world. It is used by many different militaries and counter-terrorism and police groups.

The main version of the MP5, the MP5A2, uses 9mm pistol ammunition and shoots 800 bullets per minute, which is about thirteen bullets per second. The normal magazine size (how many bullets it holds at once) is 30 rounds. There are many other versions of the gun, some which use different caliber bullets, are shorter, or have other differences. One important type of MP5 is the MP5SD series, which are MP5s with built in suppressors ('silencers'). The MP5SDs are quieter than normal guns and can be used for stealth. The MP5 is used by many special forces groups around the world, including the United States Navy Seals and the British SAS.

Meishi Street

Meishi Street, directed by Ou Ning, is a 2006 independent Chinese documentary that shows ordinary citizens taking a stand against the planned destruction of their homes for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In order to widen traffic routes for the Olympic Games, the Beijing Municipal Government orders the demolition of entire neighborhoods. Several evictees of Meishi Street, located next to Tiananmen Square, fight through endless red tape and the indifference of fellow citizens for the right to keep their homes. Given video cameras by the filmmakers, they shoot exclusive footage of the eviction process, adding vivid intimacy to their story.

Brentwood College School

Brentwood College School is a boarding school for boys and girls that helps students get ready for university. This school is in a small town called Mill Bay on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. The school has modern classrooms, a theatre, and science labs. The school is next to the ocean. Students study the ocean and can go sailing, rowing, canoeing, and kayaking.

Brentwood College School was started in 1923 in Brentwood Bay. The old school was destroyed by a fire in 1947. The school was then moved to Mill Bay and opened again in 1961. In 1972, girls started going to the school. 

Brentwood has tennis courts, rugby fields, student houses, and classrooms. There is a special building for rowing boats, a gymnasium, a medical building, and other buildings. In 1995, the theatre (T. Gill Bunch Centre) was built. This is a 20,000 square Foot (unit of length) theatre with 431 seats for the audience. Students act, play music, and dance in the theatre. 

The theatre uses a heating system that doesn't harm the environment. The school will have another sustainable development building with classrooms, a big dining room and clothes laundry in February 2010.

Brentwood offers lessons that help students get ready for university. These lessons are for students who are in grades 9, 10, 11 or 12. Brentwood is a very good school in British Columbia. All the students go to university when they leave Brentwood.

Cutscene

A cutscene is a time in a video game where the game stops and the player watches something happen. 

Usually cutscenes tell part of the story, such as showing characters talking or having a narrator say what is going on. Sometimes, however, a cutscene just shows something that is happening in the game, like a boss showing up, a ship taking off, or a building falling down.

There are many different types of cutscene. Some cutscenes are very simple and just show pictures with text like a slideshow. Others may be animated like a cartoon. Sometimes the cutscene appears directly in the game engine. 

Many new games use prerendered scenes, meaning that the scene was created when the game was made and saved as a video file. Prerendered videos are sometimes just saved movies of things recorded in the game engine, but some use Computer-generated imagery (CGI), which is separately made 3D graphics which are usually fancier than the game's normal graphics. Prerendered scenes with CGI are often used for a game's intro video.

A few games use live-action video footage, which is filmed like a movie or television show. Sometimes live-action footage will be used together with CGI.

Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution

The Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was an amendment to the United States Constitution, meaning that it was a change to the basic and most important laws that govern the United States. It abolished (stopped) slavery in the United States. It was passed in 1865, at the end of the Civil War.

Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.

Section 2. Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.

Prior to the Civil War, the Constitution allowed slavery. However, many groups sought to end slavery in the United States. The groups became the Republican Party in 1856, and gained power in 1860 with the election of Abraham Lincoln. In 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves only in certain parts of the United States, and did not actually make slavery illegal. Near the end of the Civil War, Republicans, who controlled Congress, introduced an amendment to abolish (stop) slavery in the United States. (In order for an amendment to happen, it first must be passed by both houses of Congress, and then passed by three-quarters of the states.) It was passed by three-quarters of the states and became law in late 1865.

Sic

Sic is a Latin word meaning "thus", "so", "as such", or "in such a manner". In writing, it is put in square brackets and italic type – ["sic"] – to show that an incorrect or unusual spelling, phrase, punctuation, or other quoted material has been copied (word for word) from the quoted original and is not a error. 

At first, it was said like the English word "seek" (IPA /'sik/); however, it is normally said like the English word "sick" (/'sɪk/).

The word "sic" may be used to show that an uncommon or old usage is written faithfully: for instance, quoting the U.S. Constitution:

It is often used, though, to highlight an error, sometimes to ridicule, such as here in "The Times":

Sometimes, "sic" is said to be an abbreviation for "said in context", "spelled in context", "said in copy", and other phrases. While incorrect, this still gives the same meaning when used.

A warm front is a leading edge of an advancing mass of warm air. It separates warm air from the colder air above.

Warm fronts usually have stratus and cirrus clouds, but sometimes they also have cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds. Before the warm front passes, there can be rain or snow. While it is passing, there is often light rain or drizzle.

Warm fronts move more slowly than cold fronts.

On a weather map warm fronts are shown as red lines with red semicircles pointing in the direction that the front is moving.

Bernard Herrmann (June 29, 1911 – December 24, 1975) was an American composer famous for writing music for movies. 

He won the Academy Award for the movie "The Devil and Daniel Webster" made in 1941. Herrmann often worked with director Alfred Hitchcock, including "Psycho", "North by Northwest", "The Man Who Knew Too Much", and "Vertigo". He also wrote music for many other movies, including "Citizen Kane", "Cape Fear" and "Taxi Driver". He also wrote music for radio drama including works for Orson Welles. He wrote for several fantasy movies by Ray Harryhausen, and many TV programs.

"Note: This is by the date of release, not when they were written"
These works are for a speaker and a full orchestra. These were written to be played over the radio because a human voice would not be able to be heard over the full volume of an orchestra. The 1935 works were written before June 1935.

Nadezhda von Meck

Nadezhda Filaretovna von Meck () ( - ) was a rich Russian businesswoman. She is remembered today for her strange relationship with the famous composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. For many years she paid him a lot of money each month so that he could compose. They wrote passionate love letters to one another, yet they never actually met one another.

She also gave financial support to other people in the arts and music, especially to the composers Nikolai Rubinstein and Claude Debussy.

She was born Nadezhda Filaretovna Frolovskaya. Her family owned a lot of land. Her father loved music. Her mother was a very determined business woman.

Nadezhda learned to play the piano and she read many books, learned foreign languages and learned about paintings.

When she was 16 it was arranged for her to marry Karl von Meck, a 28-year-old engineer. Together they had 18 children, of whom 11 grew up to be adults.

Her husband worked for the government. He did not earn much money and the family was growing quickly. Nadezhda wanted her husband to be rich. At this time the steam engine had recently been invented, and railways were just starting to be built in Russia. Nadezhda thought her husband could earn a lot of money building railways. She was right. As an engineer he became responsible for buildings thousands of miles of railroad tracks. The new railways allowed grain to be transported from Central Russia to places like Moscow.
He soon became a multi-millionaire.

Karl died suddenly in 1873. Nadezhda took over his business matters. She sold one railway and controlled the other one with the help of her brother. She kept away from other people, living a solitary life with her children. She was very strict indeed with them, telling them exactly what to do all the time. She did not like the idea of marriage, but realized her children would need to marry. She tried to get them to marry quickly, probably for financial reasons. 

Nadezhda von Meck was very rich and loved music, so she became an important person in Russian performing arts. Several musicians were employed by her in her house. Claude Debussy lived with the family for a time as a music teacher to her daughters. Debussy was a young man at the time, and not yet famous. 

The only concerts she went to were those given by the Russian Musical Society in Moscow. She sat alone where nobody would notice her. She met Nikolai Rubinstein. She thought he had great talent, but she disagreed with him a lot of the time. 

In 1877 she came into contact with Tchaikovsky, although she never met him. She asked him to compose some pieces for violin and piano to play at her home. Tchaikovsky knew she was a rich lady who paid well, so he quickly composed some music. They wrote letters to one another, exchanged photographs of one another, but they came to an agreement that they would never meet. She paid him 6,000 rubles a year. This was a lot of money: about twenty times the salary of an ordinary government worker. He was able to stop teaching at the Moscow Conservatory and spend his time composing. Between 1877 and 1890 they wrote about 1,200 letters to one another. Her encouragement was very important to him, and helped him to keep happy when he felt depressed.

In 1876 Tchaikovsky had decided to marry. He was then a composer aged 36. He was gay, and this was something terrible in Russia at that time. He was very frightened that people would find out and that he would be bullied. So he decided to marry. He did not care who it was he married, so long as it would make him look respectable. The next year he found a young girl called Antonina to marry. He told Nadezhda. She wrote to congratulate him and told him she hoped he would be happy. A week later, Tchaikovsky wrote to Nadezhda to ask for more money because the marriage had put him into debt. A few weeks later he was writing again to her saying that he hated his wife. He soon separated from her. Writing to Nadezhda was a great support to him at this time. It is impossible to know whether Nadezhda knew he was gay or whether that would have made a difference to her feelings. At any rate, she continued to write that she loved him. She increased the amount she was paying him to 6,000 roubles a year. This was a lot of money: about twenty times the salary of an ordinary government worker. He was able to stop teaching at the Moscow Conservatory and spend his time composing. Between 1877 and 1890 they wrote about 1,200 letters to one another. Her encouragement was very important to him, and helped him to keep happy when he felt depressed.

Her relationship with Tchaikovsky was also a good thing for her. She hated anything to do with sex, so it was good that she could express her emotions to someone whom she did not have to face in person. Tchaikovsky dedicated his Fourth Symphony to her.

On one occasion they met one another by accident. Nadezhda had invited Tchaikovsky to stay at her home. This was a huge house in enormous grounds, so it was easy to arrange that they should not meet. They agreed that they would not go out at the same time. However, one day he came home late and she went out early. She was in a horse carriage and he was walking. When they saw one another they looked away quickly.

In October 1890, von Meck sent Tchaikovsky a year's money in advance, saying that it was the last time she would be able to send him money. She said she was bankrupt. She may have worried that she probably would be bankrupt in a year’s time.

Some people think that she did this because she found out about Tchaikovsky’s homosexuality. Others disagree with this. After all, in her last letter to him she asked him never to forget her.

Nadezhda von Meck died from tuberculosis on 13 January 1894 in Nice, France, two months after Tchaikovsky had died.

<doc id="195252" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=195252" title="Sovereign state">
Sovereign state

A sovereign state is a place with borders where people live, and where a government makes laws and talks to other sovereign states. The people have to follow the laws that the government makes and only the government is allowed to hurt people or put them in jail. The government can do whatever it wants and doesn't have to do what other governments tell it to do. Most sovereign states are "recognized" which means other sovereign states agree that it's really a sovereign state. Being recognized makes it easier for a sovereign state to talk to and make agreements (treaties) with other sovereign states. There are hundreds of recognized sovereign states today - see List of sovereign states.

There is no rule to say what exactly makes a state. Usually, the things a state must have are mainly political, not legal. The Czechs and the Poles were seen as separate states during World War I, even though they did not exist as states yet. L.C. Green explained this by saying that "recognition of statehood is a matter of discretion, it is open to any existing state to accept as a state any entity it wishes, regardless of the existence of territory or an established government." 

This means that it is up to any state that already exists to treat any other group as a state. This recognition can be direct or implied. When a state does this, it usually means that the group will also be treated as a state for things that happened in the past. It does not need to mean that the state wants to have a relationship with the other group.

Sovereignty is a word that is often used wrongly. Lassa Oppenheim said that there is no idea whose meaning is more than sovereignty. No one argues the fact that from the time the idea of sovereignty was first used in political science until now, there has never been one meaning that everyone agreed on. Justice Evatt of the High Court of Australia says that "sovereignty is neither a question of fact, nor a question of law, but a question that does not arise at all." 

Although the word sovereignty often includes all types of government, ancient and modern, the modern state has some links to the type of government first seen in the 15th century, when the term "state" also first meant what it does today. Because of this, the word is often used to refer only to modern political systems.

We often use the words "country", "nation", and "state" as if they mean the same thing; but there is actually a difference:



Because the meaning of the words has changed over time and past writers often used the word "state" in a different ways it is difficult to say exactly what a state is. Mikhail Bakunin used the word simply to mean a governing organization. Other writers used the word "state" to mean any law-making or law enforcement agency. Karl Marx said that the state was what was used by the ruling class of a country to control the rule. According to Max Weber, the state is an organization who are the only people allowed to use violence in a particular area.

In 1815 at the Congress of Vienna the Final Act only recognized 39 sovereign states in Europe. Because of this, they said that in future new states would have to be recognized by other states. In practice, this meant recognition by one or more of the most powerful countries.

This constitutive theory was developed in the 19th century to describe what is and is not a state. With this theory, the need to follow international law depends on whether other sovereign governments recognize the group. Because of this, new states could not become part of the international community or be bound by international law straight away, so recognized nations did not have to respect international law in their dealings with them. 

One of the major criticisms of this law is the confusion that happens when some states recognize a new group, but other states do not. Hersch Lauterpacht, one of the main people who supported the theory, suggested that it is a state's job to grant recognition as a possible solution. However, a state may use any set of rules when judging if they should give recognition. Many states may only recognize another state if it will help them.

One of the criteria most commonly used by micronations is the Montevideo Convention. The Montevideo Convention was signed on December 26 1933 by the United States, Honduras, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Guatemala, Brazil, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Colombia, Chile, Peru and Cuba but it never received international consensus. The Montevideo Convention has four conditions that a group "should" meet to become a state:


According to this, the existence of a state does not depend upon recognition by other states. Whether or not an group meets the conditions is decided by other states when they decide if they are going to treat that group as a state. Usually, new states are formally recognized by at least a few other states.

Most sovereign states are states "de jure" and "de facto". This means they exist both in law and in real life. However, sometimes states are only "de jure" states. This means that other states see a group as the true government of a place where they have no actual control. Many European states had governments-in-exile during the Second World War which still had relations with the Allies, even though their countries were under Nazi occupation. An example today is the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which is a United Nations observer, has with 104 states. It has no land of its own, only embassies and consulates. Other states may have sovereignty over a place, but are not recognized by other states, these are "de facto" states only. Many people agree that Somaliland is such a state.

It is folded into a wikt:crescent shape before it is cooked. Calzones are made from pizza dough and filled with mozzarella and ricotta cheese. Other things such as ham, salami, vegetables or an egg can used as fillings as well. The dough is folded over, sealed along the edge and then fried. It is usually served with a seafood sauce, or with garlic, parsley and olive oil.

The Pizza Hut restaurant sells large calzones known as the P'zone. In America, the Hot Pockets brand of microwaveable turnovers are called "Bread Stuffed Calzones".

Bisexual pornography

Bisexual pornography is a genre of pornography which generally shows one woman and two men, all perform sex acts with each other. Bisexual pornography is separate from threesome pornography, which shows one man and two women.

As most pornography is marketed to men, most bisexual porn is advertised to straight or bisexual men. Very few customers of bi-porn say they are gay. Producers who use the term "bisexual porn" are usually showing what a bisexual or bi-curious man might wish to see. Sex acts between a man and a woman, as well as between two men. A common way that these are shown in a single scene is with one woman and two men performing together. 

Images and videos showing male bisexuality have been more popular since the start of internet pornography. However the area is still a very small grouping of the pornographic DVD market. For example at porn seller HotMovies.com, there are only 655 bisexual movies out of a showing of more than 90,000 films. Bisexual DVDs sell much better online than in adult video stores. This may be because customers in stores feel embarrassed to buy them. Most bisexual porn is made by small companies rather than the major studios. Actors are mostly new at porn. Any well-known actors in bisexual porn usually are from the gay pornography industry, although they may not be gay or even bisexual in their personal life.

Heterosexual actors and actresses who have appeared in bisexual porn, for example Kurt Lockwood, have had their sexual orientation doubted, and have been accused by the gay community of being in denial about their homosexuality.

Bisexual pornography may include any of the following:

Soap made from human corpses

During World War II it was believed by many people that soap was being made from the bodies of Jewish concentration camp victims. The Yad Vashem Memorial has said that the Nazis did not make soap from Jewish bodies on an large scale, saying that rumors that soap from human bodies was being made and given out were used by the Nazis to frighten camp inmates. Evidence does exist, however, which shows that research facilities had come up with a way for the large-scale making of soap from human bodies. 

The claim that Germans used the fat from human bodies to make products had already been made by the British during World War I (see Kadaververwertungsanstalt), with "The Times" reporting in April 1917 that the Germans were rendering down the bodies of their own dead soldiers for fat to make soap and other products. It was not until 1925 that the British Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain officially said that the "corpse factory" story had been an error.

Stories that the Nazis produced soap from the bodies of concentration camp victims were widely known during the war. Germany had a shortage of fats during World War II, and the production of soap was put under government control. The "human soap" stories may have started with the bars of soap being marked with the initials RIF, which was interpreted by some as "Reichs-Juden-Fett" ("State Jewish Fat"); in German acronyms, "i" and "j" were often used for either letter. RIF in fact stood for "Reichsstelle für Industrielle Fettversorgung" ("National Center for Industrial Fat Provisioning", the German government agency responsible for wartime production and distribution of soap and washing products). RIF soap was a poor quality product that contained no fat at all, human or any other kind.

Raul Hilberg reports such stories as being told in Lublin as early as October 1942. The Germans themselves were aware of the stories, as SS-chief Heinrich Himmler had received a letter describing the Poles' belief that Jewish people were being "boiled into soap" and which said that the Poles feared they would also be used to make soap. The stories were so widely known that some parts of the Polish population actually refused to buy soap. Himmler was so worried by the rumors, and the thought of poor security at the camps, that he said that all bodies should be burnt or buried as quickly as possible.

Soviet propagandist Ilya Ehrenburg reported a common version of the story as fact in his "The Complete Black Book of Russian Jewry":

During the Nuremberg Trials, Sigmund Mazur, a laboratory worker at the Danzig Anatomical Institute, that soap had been made from the bodies of dead people at the camp, and claimed that 70 to 80 kg of fat collected from 40 bodies could produce more than 25 kg of soap, and that the finished soap was retained by Professor Rudolf Spanner. Eyewitnesses included British POWs who were part of the forced labor that built the camp, and Dr. Stanisław Byczkowski, head of the Department of Toxicology at the Gdańsk School of Medicine. Holocaust survivor Thomas Blatt, who did research of the subject, found little evidence of mass production of soap from human fat, but said that there was evidence of experimental soap making. Danzig was the German name of the now-Polish city of Gdańsk.

The recipe given by Mazur read, ""5 kilos of human fat are mixed with 10 liters of water and 500 or 1,000 grams of caustic soda. All this is boiled 2 or 3 hours and then cooled. The soap floats to the surface while the water and other sediment remain at the bottom. A bit of salt and soda is added to this mixture. Then fresh water is added and the mixture again boiled 2 or 3 hours. After having cooled, the soap is poured into molds"" 

Testimony was given both by Nazis and by British prisoners of war about the development of an industrial process for producing soap from human bodies, the production of such soap on a small-scale basis, and the actual use of this soap by Nazi workers at the "Danzig Anatomic Institute." 

Evidence does exists of small-scale soap production, possibly experimental, in the camp at Stutthof concentration camp near Danzig/Gdansk. 

Holocaust historian Robert Melvin Spector says that the Nazis "did indeed use human fat for the making of soap at Stutthof," but in limited quantity.

In his book "Russia at War 1941 to 1945", Alexander Werth said that while visiting Gdansk/Danzig in 1945 shortly after its liberation by the Red Army, he saw an experimental factory outside the city for making soap from human bodies. Werth said that it had been run by "a German professor called Spanner" and "was a
nightmarish sight, with its vats full of human heads and torsoes pickled in some liquid,
and its full of a flakey substance - human soap".

The idea that "human soap" was made on an large scale by the Nazis was published after the war by Alain Resnais, who treated the testimony of Holocaust survivors as fact in his 1955 holocaust documentary movie "Nuit et brouillard". Some postwar Israelis also spoke about Jewish victims of Nazism with the Hebrew word "סבון" ("sabon", "soap").

Mainstream scholars of the Holocaust think that the idea that the Nazis made soap on an large scale to be part of WWII folklore. Among others this view was held by the reputable Jewish historians Walter Laqueur, Gitta Sereny, and Deborah Lipstadt. The same view was held by Professor Yehuda Bauer of Israel's Hebrew University and by Shmuel Krakowski, archives director of Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust center. However, historian Yisrael Gutman is very specific, stating that "it was never done on a mass scale." And Holocaust historian Robert Melvin Spector says that the Nazis "did indeed use human fat for the making of soap at Stutthof," but in small amounts.

Today Holocaust deniers use this story to make people doubt the Nazi genocide.

The Soap Myth is a 2009 play about the Nazi production of soap from the bodies of the people they murdered.

WarGames

WarGames is a 1985 movie starring Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy and directed by John Badham. The movie follows a computer hacker named David Lightman (Broderick) who breaks into a NORAD war games simulation computer that he thinks is really the computer for a computer game company. Lightman begins a series of events that could start World War III. The movie was nominated for three Academy Awards and was a big hit. It continues to be popular.

The movie begins with two air force officers in a nuclear missile silo who are ordered to fire the missiles in the silo. The officers believe the order to be real and begin to fire the missiles. One of the officers decides not to fire and so the US government replaces all the men in the missile silos with computer control. 
David Lightman (Broderick) is a smart high school student and computer hacker that at first limits himself to changing his and a girl whom he likes a lot, Jennifer's (Sheedy) grades from failing to passing grades: Lightman being smart but not motivated at school. A little while later David uses his IMSAI 8080 computer to dial many phone numbers and finds a backdoor into a NORAD war games simulation computer called WOPR (nicknamed the "Whopper"). At first David is looking for new computer games to download and play and believes that the WOPR is actually the computer of a company that makes new computer games. After finding a list of games on the computer decides to play a game. WOPR (who is an Artificial Intelligence computer) asks David for a password and after doing some research on the computer's creator Professor Steven Falken he guesses that the password is named after the creator's dead son, Joshua. After logging in using the correct password, W.O.P.R. believes David to actually be Dr. Falken whom the computer had believed to be dead. The computer (which David now calls "Joshua") asks him if he would like to play a game. David selects the game "Global Thermonuclear War". Doing so starts off a series of events that will end up taking the World into World War III unless it is stopped. 

The television news later reports that the USA went on high-alert due to a computer error leading David and Jennifer to wonder if they had caused the problem. David throws away the evidence of his calling Joshua but the computer calls David back. David then asks Joshua if the game it is playing is real or not, Joshua relies "what is the difference?" At this point David learns that Joshua is not a computer game companies' computer but a government one and is actually is playing the game for real. He hangs up but Joshua calls him back, leading David to remove the cord from the back of his telephone. David is then arrested by the FBI and taken to NORAD to answer charges of espionage. David tries to explain that he was not trying to be a spy, but he is not believed. Using things found in the medical office in which he is locked, David escapes from NORAD on a bus load of visitors to the facility. After David escapes he telephones Jennifer (using Phreaking skills) to ask her to buy him an airplane ticket so he can go and see Falken and get his help in stopping Joshua. Joshua meets him and together then both go off to convince Falken to help them stop World War III.

Professor Falken has in fact resigned from NORAD because he believes war will happen no matter what any one does. Jennifer and David try to convince him to help them explain to NORAD that this is just a game that Joshua is playing. Falken tells them that it is not worth it as it may only buy them a few years but war will still happen. He explains that they are lucky because he lives only a few miles from a primary target and that they will die in a instant. David and Jennifer decide to try to stop the game anyway and try to leave the island. Finding no way off the island since the last ferry has left, Jennifer says that they should "swim for it". David admits he can't swim. Professor Falken shows up with a helicopter and together they all go to NORAD. 

Inside NORAD Falken tells them it is all a game and they decide to allow the missiles that the Soviet Union has reportedly fired to land to see if it is real or a game. The computer screens show the missiles landing but no missiles actually land. This convinces NORAD that the whole thing was not real. Joshua, however, decides to crack the launch codes and fire the USA's missiles for real. David and Falken try to get Joshua to stop the firing and eventually succeed when Jennifer mentions the word "games". After many tries they get Joshua to play tic-tac-toe against itself in an effort to teach it the meaning of (a word meaning that there is no point to doing something, or that doing so will not help). Joshua tries every game of tic-tac-toe possible and then tries the same thing with every scenario within the Global Thermonuclear War game. Joshua then learns that war can not be won, and stops the game ending the threat of World War III.

The movie was a hit. It was nominated for three Academy Awards. The movie had a production budget of $12 million and had gross revenues of over $120 million making it a high earning movie. 

"WarGames" has a cult following amongst computer users and fans of the 1980s. The movie led to the development of the term war dialing (the calling of phone numbers looking for computers to connect to and hack).

IMSAI 8080

The IMSAI 8080 was an early microcomputer begun in late 1975, based on the Intel 8080 and later 8085 and the S-100 bus. It was compatible with its main competitor, the earlier MITS Altair 8800, by which it was inspired. The IMSAI is largely thought of as the first "clone" computer. The IMSAI machine used a highly modified version of the CP/M operating system called IMDOS. It was designed, made and sold by IMS Associates, Inc. (later renamed "IMSAI Manufacturing Corp"). In total, between 17,000 and 20,000 units were produced from 1975 until 1978.

In May 1972, William Millard began business as "IMS Associates" (IMS) in the area of computer consultancy and engineering, using his home as an office. By 1973, Millard began IMS Associates, Inc. Millard soon found capital for his business, and received several contracts, all for software. 

In 1974, IMS was contacted by a client which wanted a "workstation system" that could do jobs for any General Motors new-car dealership. IMS planned a system including a terminal, small computer, printer, and special software. Five of these work stations were to have common access to a hard disk, which would be controlled by a small computer. Eventually product development was stopped. Millard and his chief engineer Joe Killian turned to the microprocessor. Intel had the 8080 chip, and compared to the 4004 to which IMS Associates had first used, the 8080 looked like a better idea. Full scale development of the IMSAI 8080 was begun, and by October 1975 an advertisement was placed in the magazine "Popular Electronics", receiving positive reactions. 

IMS shipped the first IMSAI 8080 kits on December 16 1975. In 1976, IMS was renamed to "IMSAI Manufacturing Corporation" because by then they were a manufacturing company, not a consultancy one. By October 1979 the IMSAI corporation had gone bankrupt, and the 'IMSAI' trademark was acquired by Thomas "Todd" Fischer and Nancy Freitas (former early employees of IMS Associates), who continued manufacturing the computers under the IMSAI name as a division of Fischer-Freitas Co. Support for early IMSAI systems continues to this day.

The IMSAI 8080 was used for

An IMSAI 8080 and an acoustic coupler type modem were among the hacking tools used by the main character in the 1983 movie "WarGames". However, even by 1983 the acoustic coupler was out of date. It was selected over a more modern model so that the audience would immediately recognize it as the device that connected to the telephone.

The 2009 Romanian bus-train collision (), happened on August 14, 2009 at 14:10pm in Romania. A bus and train hit each other. Thirteen people died. It happened in Scânteia of Iaşi County in Romania on County Road 248C. It was originally thought that only 10 people died in the accident. This was the worst accident in Romania in the past fifteen years.

The accident happened when a minibus carrying 16 passengers was moving across a railway crossing. The minibus was hit by a train as it was crossing the railway crossing near Scânteia. Everyone that was killed in the accident was on the bus, which included a child. Three more people were badly injured. The bus was hit in the center of it and was pushed a total of 350 meters by the train. The reason why the crash happened in the first place was because the bus driver did not follow the light signals or signs at the railway crossing.

The Guard button is used to defend against attacks. Pressing the Guard and Punch buttons at the same time will result in a throw. Throws only work when the opponent is not attacking.

It's like Rock Paper Scissors between Attack, Throw and Guard.

Wikipedia:Very good articles/Victoria line

The line has hump-backed stations which allow trains to store gravitational potential energy as they arrive and to then use this energy as they leave the stations. The stations are on top of small hills, or humps. As the train travels up the hill to the station its weight helps it to slow down. As the train leaves the station it travels down the hill, with gravity helping the train to speed up. This saves 5% energy and makes the trains run 9% faster. Each new platform built for the Victoria Line is 132.6 metres long. 183 million people use the Victoria line each year.

There are many editors violating this tenet of respect and good will. It is about a trend from editors. Failures to assume good faith, and outright personal attacks threaten the colloborative atmosphere. So, starting about now, I'm going to caution, warn, then either block, or bring up for discussion based on the history of the whatever editor is displaying a pattern of disrespect and bad faith/bad will. This attitude of "i can say whatever I want about an editor" has to stop. This is a small community. We are all volunteers. Best, () 18:25, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

Could an admin go to simple wiktionary and show Brett how to change the popups so they are like the ones here? Preferably, an admin that has experience changing things like that (Twinkle, HotCat). Go to their Simple Talk. Brett (admin) has already approved the change, he just needs to be shown how. () 22:09, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

I need the bot flag. I am adding and changing stubs, and adding articles to cats (a lot of articles). In 10 minutes I will start doing it whether I have the flag or not (per NVS's comments at my talk page). () 01:17, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

I am now finished replacing stubs. You can take away the flag if you want, but I will need it back around 2200 today. Since, I will not be editing from now until that time, it will probably be easier to leave the flag on. () 03:41, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

Finished for now. Will restart editing around 1400. () 04:08, 11 August 2009 (UTC)

Blatant vandal IP accounts are often open proxies. Please check to see if they are an open proxy before blocking. Proxies should be blocked for at least a year. Unlike on enwiki, it is difficult to maintain blocks if we only block them for short periods of time. If you don't know if it's a proxy, have a look at the English Wikipedia block log, where it is bound to be blocked already. Thanks, 22:53, 20 August 2009 (UTC)

I don't mean to sound like a broken record. :) Please consider not disabling the talk page editing on these blocks. There is no way for the IP to communicate.

<doc id="195565" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=195565" title="Asylum seeker">
Asylum seeker

An asylum seeker is a person who fled from its country but is not accepted yet as refugee.

The decision whether a person is a refugee or not is most often left to certain government agencies within the host country. This can lead to a situation where the country will see a asylum seeker neither as refugee nor as legitimate migrant. Then he will be treated as illegal alien even if his life was endangered in the Country he fled from. 

As long as a country does not see a person as refugee this person will not have the rights and the country will not have the obligations that the legislation of the receiving country and the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees gives to refugee. 


</doc>
<doc id="195568" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=195568" title="Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees">
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees

The United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees is an international agreement that defines who is a refugee, and makes clear what are the rights of individuals who are granted asylum and the responsibilities of nations that grant asylum. It also makes clear which people are "not" seen as refugees, such as war criminals. 

The convention was approved at a special United Nations conference on 28 July 1951. It was initially limited to protecting European refugees after World War II but a 1967 protocol removed the geographical and time limits. Because the convention was approved in Geneva, it is often referred to as "the Geneva Convention," though it is not one of the Geneva Conventions specifically dealing with allowable behavior in time of war.

Denmark was the first state to ratify the treaty (on 4 December 1952) and there are now 147 signatories to either the Convention or the Protocol or to both.

Chapter 1 consists of Articles from 1 to 11. Article 1 of the Convention as amended by the 1967 Protocol provides the definition of a refugee: 

Chapter II consists of Articles 12 to 16, which define personal status and right of property, of association and access to court for the refugees.

Article 17 defines the right to "wage-earning employment", Article 18 on "self-employment" and Article 19 on "liberal professions" for the refugees. Chapter III consists of those Articles.

Article 20 defines the right to rationing, Article 21 defines the right to housing, Article 23 defines the right to public relief, and Article 24 defines the condition on labour and right to social security. Chapter IV consists of those Articles.

Chapter V consists of Articles from 25 to 34, which are on the fundamental legal right of the refugees. Especially Article 31 affirms that penalty must not imposed on a refugee who has entered the country illegally, because of escape necessary from a threat to life or freedom of the person. Article 32 affirms that a country must not expel any refugee only because of national security or public order. And Article 33 affirms "Prohibition of expulsion or return (in French "Refoulement")". That means any country must not expel or return a refugee to any other countries where the life or freedom of the refugee would be threatened because of the race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or the political opinion of the person. And Article 34 affirms that a country must as far as possible facilitate the assimilation and naturalisation of such refugees.

Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry

The Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry or simply the Très Riches Heures ("The Very Rich Hours of the Duke of Berry") is a richly decorated Book of Hours. Such books contained prayers to be said by lay faithful at each of the canonical hours of the day. The book was commissioned by Jean, Duc de Berry around 1410. It is probably the most important illuminated manuscript of the 15th century, ""le roi des manuscrits enluminés"" ("the king of illuminated manuscripts"). The "Très Riches Heures" has 416 pages. 131 of them have large miniatures, many more have border decorations or historiated initials. These artworks are among the high points of International Gothic painting, even though they are very small. There are 300 decorated capital letters. The book was worked on, over a period of nearly a century, in three main campaigns, led by the Limbourg brothers, Barthélemy van Eyck, and Jean Colombe. The book is now Ms. 65 in the Musée Condé, Chantilly, France.

Human Development Index

The Human Development Index is a number used to compare different countries. It is used to rank countries into different groups like developed, developing and underdeveloped countries. 

The Human Development Index uses different measurements of a population, namely

The Human Development Index has been criticized for a number of reasons:
Two authors claimed that the human development reports "have lost touch with their original vision and the index fails to capture the essence of the world it seeks to portray". The index has also been criticized as "redundant" and a "reinvention of the wheel", measuring aspects of development that have already been exhaustively studied. The index has further been criticized for having an inappropriate treatment of income, lacking year-to-year comparability, and assessing development differently in different groups of countries.

Some authors have proposed alternative indices to address some of the index's shortcomings.

Economist Bryan Caplan has criticized the way scores in each of the three components are bounded between zero and one, so rich countries effectively cannot improve their ranking in certain categories, even though there is a lot of scope for economic growth and longevity left, "This effectively means that a country of immortals with infinite per-capita GDP would get a score of .666 (lower than South Africa and Tajikistan) if its population were illiterate and never went to school." Scandinavian countries consistently come out top on the list, he argues, "because the HDI is basically a measure of how Scandinavian your country is."

The HDI has been criticized as a redundant measure that adds little to the value of the individual measures composing it; as a means to provide legitimacy to arbitrary weightings of a few aspects of social development; as a number producing a relative ranking which is useless for inter-temporal comparisons, and difficult to compare a country's progress or regression because the HDI for a country in a given year depends on the levels of, say, life expectancy or GDP per capita of other countries in that year. However, each year, UN member states are listed and ranked according to the computed HDI. If high, the rank in the list can be easily used as a means of national aggrandizement; alternatively, if low, it can be used to highlight national insufficiencies. Using the HDI as an absolute index of social welfare, some authors have used panel HDI data to measure the impact of economic policies on quality of life.

Vancouver Whitecaps FC is a soccer club which plays in Canada.

The original Vancouver Whitecaps were founded on December 11, 1973 and during the 1970s and 1980s played in the North American Soccer League (NASL). The Whitecaps achieved success, winning the 1979 Soccer Bowl.

It was during this short time that soccer became popular in Vancouver. The Whitecaps crowds at Empire Stadium grew to sell out crowds, at 32,000 fans per match.

After playing at Vancouver's 32,000-seat Empire Stadium for most of their early years, the team moved into the new 60,000-seat BC Place Stadium in 1983. However, the end of the NASL in 1984 meant the Whitecaps, could not longer play in the NASL. 

Two years later, after a pause of play in 1985, the Whitecaps played in the CSL for a short period of time, until the early 1990s. They then played in the USL. And now, they play in Major League Soccer, which they started playing in in 2011.

Women's voting rights in the United States

Women's suffrage (the right to vote) in the United States started slowly, at state and local levels, during the 19th Century and early 20th Century, ending in 1920 with the passing of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which provided: "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex."

Lydia Chapin (Taft) (February 2, 1712 – November 9, 1778) was a starter of women's suffrage movement in Colonial America. She was the first woman legally ok to vote in colonial America. After the death of her wealthy (had much money) husband and elder son left the family without an adult wikt:heir, she was given this right by the town meeting of Uxbridge, Massachusetts in 1756. For the great majority of American women, voting rights were not granted.

<doc id="195971" url="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=195971" title="Azua de Compostela">
Azua de Compostela

The Dominican city of Azua de Compostela, or simply Azua, is the head municipality of the Azua province, on the south of the country, about 5 km north of the Caribbean coast. It is also called sometimes "Compostela de Azua".

"Azua" is the Taíno name of the region where the old city was founded. In this place, Pedro Gallego (or Pedro Mariscal), a Spanish colonist, developed a farm and he gave it the name of "Compostela" after Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, nortwestern Spain.

The municipality had, in 2002, a total population of 87,024: 44,178 men and 42,846 women. The urban population was 64.87% of the total population. In this numbers are included the population of the municipal districts that are part the municipality. The population of Azua de Compostela without those municipal districts was 56,453.

The town was founded in 1504 by Diego Velázquez, who later went to conquest the island of Cuba; the Spanish governor of the Hispaniola island at that time was Nicolás de Ovando. The town was in the original region of Azua, where there was a Taíno town and Pedro Gallego had a farm. This place is called now "Pueblo Viejo" (in English, "Old Town"), at about 8 km to the soutwest of the modern city.

The first secretary of the town was Hernán Cortés. He lived in Azua from 1504 to 1511, when he left to Cuba and, later, to conquest México.

Several sugar factories were established around the town and pirates came here to get the sugar and other products.

In 1751 there was a strong earthquake that destroyed the old town and a new one was founded on the right (western) side of the River Vía, where the modern city is now.

Because Azua is on the road that goes from the western part of the island to Santo Domingo, the city was destroyed several times during the Dominican-Haitian War (1844-1856). Two important battles (the "Azua Battles") were fought in the city; the first was on 19 March 1844 and the second on 1849.

The municipality of Azua de Compostela is in a very dry valley (the "Azua Valley" or "Azua Plain") where cacti and other plants of dry regions are common. Farming is possible only with irrigation.

Azua is at 97 km to the west of Santo Domingo. The average temperature in the city is 27.0 °C and the average rainfall is 665.30 mm but it rains in only 53.3 days.

The land around the city is very flat, with only a few very small hills but there are mountains in the north and northwest of the municipality; those mountains are part of the "Cordillera Central". The only river in the municipality is the "Vía", a very small river that flows through the city.

The limits of the municipality are the municipality of Peralta to the north, the municipality of Estebanía to the east, the Caribbean Sea to the south, the municipality of Pueblo Viejo to the southwest and the municipality of Sabana Yegua to the west.

Azua de Compostela has eight municipal districts; these are:

The main economic activity in the province is farming. In the valley, the most important crops are banana, plantain, vegetables and fruits like mango.

Fishing is important along the Caribbean coast.

Tropical Storm Ana (2009)

Tropical Storm Ana was the first tropical storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season. It was also the first tropical cyclone to affect the Caribbean during 2009. The storm formed on August 11, but strong wind shear weakened it on August 13. Ana later reformed and became a tropical storm on August 15 before wind shear tore apart the storm again. The storm finally died on August 17.

Between August 15 and 17, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) gave out tropical storm watches to some Caribbean islands like the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic. Some people took a few precautions. Most of the damage from Ana was in the form of rain.

A tropical wave formed over the Cape Verde islands on August 9. The NHC started watching the storm to see if it would turn into a tropical cyclone. It became a tropical depression on August 11. By then, the storm had a lot of thunderstorm activity near its center. On August 12, the NHC said that the storm was close to tropical storm-stength. While the storm was still alive, it was not called a tropical storm. However it was later found that the storm had actually reached tropical storm strength winds. The next day, the storm began to weaken and fall apart because of wind shear and dry air. The remains of the storm moved west across the Atlantic Ocean.

On August 14, the NHC saw that the storm was reforming. Later that day, a Hurricane Hunter airplane flew into the storm and the NHC started to follow the storm again. On August 15, the storm was given the name "Ana" after it reached tropical storm strength. Soon wind shear started to affect Ana again. The next day, the storm moved into an area of dry air over the Caribbean Sea. Ana weakened into a depression after another Hurricane Hunter airplane found no tropical storm-winds. The storm's circulation fell apart and Ana finally died on August 17.

On August 15, a tropical storm watch was given to the islands of St. Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius, Antigua, Barbuda, the British Virgin Islands, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, and the United States Virgin Islands. Later on August 17, Puerto Rico, Dominica, Guadeloupe, St. Martin, and St. Barthelemy were also put on tropical storm watch. When Ana weakened into a remnant low later that day, all watches were stopped.

In St. Thomas, wind speeds from Ana were recorded at 28 mph (45 km/h) and gusts peaked at 40 mph (65 km/h). Also, a lot of rainfall created flooding in Puerto Rico. But there was only little damage done. At most, 4 in (100 mm) of rain fell on the island. Some streets had to be shut down because of the flooding. About 6,000 people lost electricity from the storm. Tree branches broke down power lines. People also reported tornadoes and waterspouts created by Ana in Puerto Rico. The remains of Ana brought rainfall to parts of Hispaniola. But no damage was reported.

Suppressor

A suppressor, often called a "silencer" is a device used to make a gun less loud. Suppressors are most often added to the gun barrel, many times by screwing the silencer onto the end of the barrel. However, some guns have a built-in suppressor.

Even though many people use the name "silencer" when talking about a suppressor, it does not really make the gun silent.. Most guns are still "very" loud even with a suppressor added. It is important to wear ear protection even with a suppressor.

In many places, suppressors are illegal to own except for the military and police. This is because suppressors make guns quieter and people worry this could help criminals commit crime.

All,

I bring to your attention the closures of Majorly's and Barras' RfOs by NonvocalScream.

These elections have, in my opinion, been closed inappropriately for three reasons. Firstly, the closure of RfXs should not be undertaken by anyone but an elected Bureaucrat - this is, after all, what we appointed them to do - regardless of whether it is vote counting or not. Secondly, NVS has a clear COI with the elections, being involved with them, and so should not have closed them. Finally, the votes should be left to run for the specified time period and not closed early - there is no "SNOW pass".

I request that until this is resolved neither Majorly nor Barras use their Oversight tools and instead continue to request actions from the Stewards.

Regards,

Two incorrect points: "there were still about two weeks to run" - no, RFO don't have an ending date, they only end once consensus, or otherwise is reached. "the closure of RfXs should not be undertaken by anyone but an elected Bureaucrat" - no, bureaucrats close RFAs and RFBs. Checkuser and oversight are a totally different set of tools. Additionally, if I see something that needs oversighting, I will be oversighting it myself. Enough of this dramamongering nonsense. 12:44, 15 August 2009 (UTC)
To Chenzw: I know the last consensus was to have no more than 3 oversighters. But is there a meta policy that prevents a wiki from having more than 3 oversighters? — 14:59, 15 August 2009 (UTC)
I don't know/recall if the "consensus" was to elect exactly three, or at least two. If we agree on exactly three, it is probably a bad idea to give the spot to the "next person who reaches 25 support". Rather we should look who the best candidate for the spot is. At the moment we have two, which is workable. Can we postpone the closing until either time's up, or there is visibly no more movemement in the process? - This also gives us time to agree on what we want. -- () 15:13, 15 August 2009 (UTC)

That does it. I will be resigning as soon as another is elected. I'm sick and tired of this bloody dramamongering about nothing. 18:32, 15 August 2009 (UTC)



Open for flames. ;) -- () 20:18, 15 August 2009 (UTC)

I propose to add a new user rights that would enable non-admins to delete articles labeled , which is an administrative function granted to trusted users. Trusted users with the deletion rights would be allowed to delete vandalism or test articles from anon IPs. Essentially, the user right would be similiar to rollbackers. The tool would be used solely to fight vandalism. Admins should be allowed to grant and revoke the deleting rights. Abuse of the tool can be quickly solved by having an admin remove the abuser from his rights, and a possible block. — 18:07, 15 August 2009 (UTC)
article a now has the history of both b and c AND it is over 5000 revisions, this means that the article cannot be delete (well, it can be delete by a steward or dev...) to clean up the history. That case would require developer intervention to fix. -- 01:43, 16 August 2009 (UTC)

"Link to previous discussion: here"

I think that we've now reached the point where anonymous editing is not providing us with any benefits. In the past few hours for instance we have had to deal with a massive flurry of personal attacks and heavy amount of vandalism. I think that useful anon edits probably stand at less than 2% of all anon edits. I'd like to encourage the community to consider turning off the ability of anons to edit at all. Thanks! 05:26, 16 August 2009 (UTC)

Today is an example of why we should ban anonymous editing, though I don't know if we have the authority to do so. ( • ) 06:14, 16 August 2009 (UTC)
Banning IP editing is like saying anyone who is not an admin in this wiki is not welcome. Its true that the majority of vandalism comes from IPs, but almost everyone here who has an account and is a regular editor is also an admin, or former admin. If we made a requirement to have a user account just to edit here, we would be more of a failure in the eyes of WMF, meta, and ENWP. — 08:04, 16 August 2009 (UTC)


No. If this is that much of a problem, disable anon page creation or enable the abusefilter. This is not the solution. (btw, Chenzw force preview won't work because users can just disable javascript) -- 09:36, 16 August 2009 (UTC)

Sorry, I disagree. Not "all" anonymous editors are bad and not all registered users are good. I don't think it will do anything to protect vandalism, just like with IPs all you have to do is sign up for an account and after it's blocked, you use another proxy and start all over again. As said, Wikipedia is for anyone to edit. [: -- 17:39, 16 August 2009 (UTC)

No way. I disagree, as I am an anon myseldf. I can't create an account because I would just get blocked in just about two days. () 18:31, 16 August 2009 (UTC)
2% is an incredibly low number. I think that about 50% (or more) of IP edits are productive. Yes, there are problems created, but there are a lot of articles created by IPs, a lot of vandalism reverted by IPs, and a lot of expansion by IPs. Yes, it is as easy as creating an account, but some IPs do not want to (for whatever reason [usually it's because they're stubborn]). I had over 100 edits with my IP before I decided I like WP enough, and decided to create an account. Because our WP focuses on children (who are unlikely to create an account immediately), or ESL people (who might not want to create one), it should be kept open (even if it does mean protecting user pages, adding names to the blacklist, etc., the positive outweighs the negative). () 21:32, 16 August 2009 (UTC)

I think people misunderstand "anyone can edit". Disabling anon editing will not prevent anyone from editing. They would just have to take the extremely minor effort to create an account to do so. Instead of a load of meaningless numbers, these contributors will have a recognisable name, and this silly "anyone can edit" business still works all the same. 00:35, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

Also, if this has been sparked by the amount of IP vandalism which has need oversighting, this is definitely not the solution. They will simply start creating accounts and then editing - this will in fact hinder our efforts to stop them because then only checkusers will be able to see their IP addresses. Also, I think vandals will regard this as a victory against Wikipedia and it may encourage them to continue. The only kind of vandals this will stop are driveby vandals (e.g. bored kids at school) - there is no evidence to support the theory that this will stop more persistent and long term vandals. -- 08:26, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

Hello all,

I think we need to seriously need to discuss who closes what kind of requests, after what time; this is in the context of assigning privileges/flags (Admin, Crat, CU, Oversighter). My take on this may be too simple, but I'll state it here anyway:
Please express your opinion, so we can find a way to get a guideline (based on "consesus") on this matter. Note that I simply started the discussion; by the end, consensus on something is hopefully evident. -- () 18:58, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

I believe that only bureaucrats should be closing RfAs and RfBs. RfOS and RfCUs should be left to stewards to make the ultimate decision and then closed by a bureaucrat here. RfDs, GAVs and VGAVs could be closed by administrators. This is my opinion that non-administrators really don't have any real right to close any requests unless it is a clearcut WP:SNOW case. Cheers, 19:02, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

Frankly, I don't see why we have to come up with our own rules on this. EN wiki seems to have hammered this out pretty well, imo. So let's just copy their rules for it here and avoid the (needless) drama. --""  04:46, 18 August 2009 (UTC)

You know we keep trying and failing miserably. Recently, there was the thread about "what should we do with stubs". We seem to have forgotten about that... Well, you all know we're going through hard times, the drama level is high but we all know that wikipedia is an encyclopedia built to make it better so people can benefit from it; and we aren't here to argue. This is why I want this to reach a conclusion.

We have to concentrate on getting articles to GA/VGA status or just writting articles that are good without having the little star or plus sign. These will be the things that'l most likely attract new editors. We have the , so why not build those articles first? 

There are different stages to building a GA. Writting the article, simplifying, reviewing the article, and fixing the points the reviewer found. What we need is to determine what each person is good at doing/wants to do. So I'm asking you what do you think you're good at doing or what do you want to do? Once we get things going it should work easily. We take every article in the List one by one, and we all do what we've selected. The people that write the article start, then come the simplifying team (in the mean time the writing team starts work on another article), then the reviewers come and review it, and the fixing teams is last. Once we've done one, things should work like a chain. It's no more complicated than that.

Please only choose the one thing you'd like to do.





Thanks you for your time. Remember we are here to build a wiki, and if you don't want to go and write articles that help others, well you obvisouly don't really care that much for it. 22:14, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

...that is dying again? There are hooks that need dealing with and new hooks need to be nominated! Come on gang, let's not let this die again! :-) 03:01, 18 August 2009 (UTC)

How about more focus being put on the Simple Wiktionary, trying to find easy ways to simplify phrasing complex terms, then applying that to English WP Articles that are forked here, instead of people just starting articles by scratch. Also, maybe it should be said that taking longer and more convoluted summaries to get across a concept then with the English Wiki is fine as long as it does so with Simple English.-- () 18:22, 20 August 2009 (UTC)
Could I kindly ask that editors who QD tag pages where the title of the page itself is an attack kindly avoid using to do so? Using Twinkle leaves a record of the attack on the talk page of the attacker. Pages like this should really be avoided. I'll be talking to bot owners about the same thing. It's has taken me a lot of effort to undo these notifications and all of them have been to this latest IP proxy vandal. Thanks! 19:09, 19 August 2009 (UTC)

A few questions to think about:
I'm pro abusefilter - however if we enable it we have to get it right or else we'll mess everything up. -- 03:45, 22 August 2009 (UTC)

Currently, we have a bot that detects and reverts vandalism. I think the question to ask is not whether we want the abuse filter or not, but which of the two anti-vandalism options is better (i.e. which is more sensitive to pick up vandalism, but also more selective to avoid false positives?) Also, I know that GoblinBot4 doesn't typically revert more than once on the same article, but I don't know how to abuse filter functions. I think the question should ideally be: ""given the choice between the Abuse Filter or GoblinBot4, which is better?"" 10:36, 24 August 2009 (UTC)

During this time of planning, members of the community have the opportunity to propose ideas, ask questions, and help to chart the future of the Foundation. In order to create as centralized an area as possible for these discussions, the Strategy Wiki has been launched. This wiki will provide an overview of the strategic planning process and ways to get involved, including just a few questions that everyone can answer. All ideas are welcome, and everyone is invited to participate.

Please take a few moments to check out the strategy wiki. It is being translated into as many languages as possible now; feel free to leave your messages in your native language and we will have them translated (but, in case of any doubt, let us know what language it is, if not english!).

There's a few ways we could go about getting rid of stubs. I understand that this is a perennial proposal, but something "needs" to be done.

Let's create a mission and a vision for this project (just like corporations), and focus the project to meet them. Deleting most of the stubs is a huge task, and I'm not sure that we have consensus for it (at least 80%, it's a big change). From what I have heard, we cannot agree to whom this project is marketed to, and that is a big part of this argument. The question is (IMO): 1. Can these stubs be expanded? and 2. Do our readers want to know about these topics? If the answer is yes to both questions they should be kept. () 18:29, 12 August 2009 (UTC)
I agree with:

To me the last point is a very good idea, and can solve a lot of the stub problems. 19:07, 12 August 2009 (UTC)
<-----What about making a template that says that the person who creates a stub has a week to get it expanded into a non-stub before it gets deleted? That way, people are forced to write on only a single article and expand it into non-stub territory or face it getting deleted. Good idea? 19:41, 12 August 2009 (UTC)

<-Agree with Fr33kman. We should get some great article writers from enWP to come here for a week and improve the core articles. I don't think they would object. As TRM pointed out at WP:AN, we (the community) do not spend enough time in the article space. Perhaps 80% of community edits are not in article space. () 22:20, 12 August 2009 (UTC)

I simply do not understand the problem with stubs - sure they are frustrating, but a simple stub is better than nothing. There is far too much emphasis on deleting - let us simply expand. I think some editors find writing too hard so they want to delete things instead. Let see a stub instead as a "seed" - an article that has been started and needs to grow. Join the if you are serious about improving quality. But enough, I'm going back to writing in the mainspace! () 09:41, 15 August 2009 (UTC)

Though I trust JC, and he has been a good admin here, I do not find it fair he gets his admin rights back. He requested that they be removed a few days ago, and they are given back without any kind of consensus on wiki ("the reason for giving them back was per irc"). I'm not asking for this to be changed, personnally I dont' care. But could we next time be told about these kind of things onwiki. Thanks, 07:57, 22 August 2009 (UTC)

It is always common practice that if an administrator resigns without controversy surrounding them, that they will get the rights back by request (as long as there were no major changes in that user's behavior during the period without the tools). Consensus is not needed, the user just needs to ask a 'crat to restore the tools. (ec'd with Djsasso who said the same thing basically). () 12:47, 22 August 2009 (UTC)

Some UN member states, most notably the Muslim nations have said that they support "Pakistan's territorial integrity", in reference to Kashmir as Pakistani regions, but only India has made a public declaration of sovereignty over the disputed region.

Here are a few examples supporting Pakistan's integrity:

MissingNo.

MissingNo., also known as MissingNO, is the name of a glitch Pokémon that is short for "Missing Number". It is a programming bug after two game events were programmed wrongly.

First documented by Nintendo in the May 1999 issue of "Nintendo Power", encountering MissingNo. results in messed up graphics and item duplication of the player's sixth item in their item. It has an unique effect upon the Pokémon community unlike anything else.

There are two reasons why the player encounters MissingNo., both as a result of programming bugs. The first is caused by the way the game stores battle information and the second is caused by the Old Man script in Viridian City. When traveling from one area to another, the game assigns numbers for Pokémon that the player encounters to a data buffer, read by the game when they encounter a wild Pokémon. However, on the right side of the Cinnabar and Seafoam Islands, no data was actually assigned to this buffer, and the information from the previous area is used instead (the player's name data).

Once encountered, players can fight, flee, or capture MissingNo. just like any other wild Pokémon in the game. After encountering the MissingNo., the sixth item in the player's item menu will be copied to 128, and the game's "Hall of Fame" gallery will become scrambled forever. Other display problems may happen, though these can be fixed by viewing a Pokédex entry or resetting the Game Boy. It commonly appears as a scrambled "d" shaped rectangle, though sometimes (encounter values) it will look like a Ghost or two fossils.

Even though it has only appeared in only two games in Pokémon, MissingNo. has had a lot of impact. Nintendo says it a "programming quirk" and doesn't want players to encounter it and later removing the glitch in the next game, "Pokémon Yellow". However, information on how to encounter MissingNo. was printed in a lot of magazines and player's guides due to its effect, while some "Pokemon" players tried to sell real and fake "tips" for capturing MissingNo. for up to $200. In 2009, IGN put MissingNo in their "Top 10 Easter Eggs" in games list, describing it as a "glitchimon" and saying it was useful for making copies of items. In another article, they said "It really says something about "Pokemon" fans that they took what is a potentially game ruining glitch and used it as a shortcut to level up their Pokemon.".

Reactions by players to MissingNo. has been studied by sociological studies regarding individuals and games. Sociologist William Sims Bainbridge said in a study that Game Freak "spawned one of the most popular glitches ever in game history", due to the good and bad results of it and players' interesting use of it. The book "Playing with Videogames" studied the effect of MissingNo. deeply, studying players' curious actions as a result of its appearance and examining their own notes along with individual "sightings" reports, studying and criticizing other people's findings. The book further describes the extent to which gaming communities revolving around "Pokémon" have attempted to make it a real aspect of the game's world through elements such as fan fiction and fan art, adding that this in turn inspires creativity. It also says that people were celebrating and publicizing glitches in the game while trying to make it canon, and adds that MissingNo. popularity was an unusual case.

Dolla (rapper)

Roderick Anthony Burton II (1988 – May 18, 2009) was a rapper, better known by his stage name Dolla. He had a hit single with "Who The Fuck is That" featuring T-Pain and Taye Dzim. A remix was made featuring Akon and T-Pain. Dolla was shot in the back three times while trying to run away from gunshots fired by Aubrey Lewis Berry. The two had an argument and seconds later, Aubrey shot Dolla in the parking lot of a PF Chang's, which is an American restaurant. Aubrey fled and Dolla was taken to a hospital where he later died. On May 22 2010, charges were dropped against Aubrey Berry for the death of Dolla, as he was claiming self-defense. Evidence pointed out that Berry felt threatened by Burton due to a previous altercation in Atlanta a week before to the shooting. Burton's funeral was held in Atlanta's east point neighborhood on May 23 2009. He was buried in Westview Cemetary in Atlanta.

Bangladesh–Soviet Union relations

Bilateral Relations between the then Soviet Union and Bangladesh were cordial in the years immediately following the independence of 1971. The Soviet Union supported Indian actions in aiding the war of liberation, and after the war the Soviet Navy sent a floating workshop to Bangladesh for clearing Pakistani mines from the Chittagong and Chalna harbors. Mujib visited Moscow in 1972, and high-level officials from both countries made numerous reciprocal visits until 1975. The Soviets supported the socialist programs of the Mujib government and its very exceptionally close ties with India. Early Soviet aid was limited, however. During the first four months of its existence, Bangladesh received economic aid worth US$142 million from India, but only US$6 million from the Soviet Union.

It also believed that the Communist Party of Bangladesh was funded and supported in the erstwhile volatile region of the former "East Pakistan" since then it was part of a United Pakistan itself allied with the United States and the China which were hostile towards rival Soviet Union, the party itself was based on the idealogical principals of Marxism.

Bangladeshi-Soviet relations rapidly improved in 1984 and regained a level of cordiality in the mid- and late 1980s. In 1985 the Soviet Cultural Centre reopened in Dhaka. In 1986 a Soviet special envoy visited Dhaka, and later the Bangladeshi foreign minister visited Moscow. Although Soviet aid to Bangladesh was still small compared with assistance from Japan, the United States, or even China, by 1987 Bangladesh had entered into sixteen different economic accords with the Soviet Union. Soviet assistance has concentrated on the energy sector, especially several power plants at Ghorasal, near Dhaka.

Scottish National Party

The Scottish National Party (SNP) (Pàrtaidh Nàiseanta na h-Alba; Scottish (Scottis Naitional Pairtie) is a centre-left political party in Scotland. It campaigns mostly for Scotland to leave the United Kingdom and become an independent country. It is a social democratic party and is currently the largest party in the Scottish Parliament, with 47 out of 126 seats and it's party leader Alex Salmond is First Minister of Scotland.

Most SNP supporters believe in the following things:


The Scottish National Party was founded in 1934. During World War II, it's leader Douglas Young told Scottish people not to join the war effort and as a result he was widely disliked. The first SNP Member of Parliament was Robert McIntyre, who entered parliament in a by-election for Motherwell in 1945, but he lost the seat at the general election of that year. The party struggled in the 1950s but achieved greater success in the 1960s and in 1967, Winnie Ewing was elected as an MP for the party at a by-election in Hamilton. Only 1 seat was won by the SNP at the 1970 general election but at the February 1974 general election, it won 7 seats. Following the discovery of oil in the North Sea, the SNP ran a campaign called 'It's Scotland's oil' meaning that they thought it should benefit only the Scots and the party won 11 seats and 30% of the vote in Scotland at the October 1974 general election.

When the Labour government of James Callaghan started losing it's majority in parliament, it made deals with the smaller parties including the Liberal Party, the SNP and the Welsh nationalists. The SNP only agreed to support this if a referendum was given to the Scottish people on the creation of a devolved assembely. The referendum gained support from 51% of Scots but the Labour government decided that not enough people had voted in the referendum and because of this, the SNP refused to support the Labour government. The general election of 1979 saw the SNP reduced to only 2 seats in parliament.

The party did poorly at the general elections of 1983, 1987 and 1992. Alex Salmond became party leader in 1990 and in 1997, the party won 6 seats in parliament. The Labour government of Tony Blair established a Scottish Parliament in 1999 and at the elections held for the new parliament, the SNP came in second place behind Labour, with 35 out of 128 seats. It wasn't until the 2007 Scottish Parliament election that the SNP made another major breakthrough and at this election, the party won the most seats with 47 out of 128 seats and a minority government was then formed with Alex Salmond made First Minister.

The party tried to give Scotland a referendum on independence in 2010, but the other major parties in the Scottish Parliament stopped them.

Pussycat Dolls

The Pussycat Dolls (sometimes called PCD) is an American pop girl group and dance group started by choreographer Robin Antin. 

The group began in 1995 as a burlesque group based in Los Angeles, California. Antin was able to arrange a record deal with A&M Records and Interscope Records in 2003, and the Pussycat Dolls changed into a music group. By 2005 the group was lead singer Nicole Scherzinger, with Melody Thornton, Jessica Sutta, Ashley Roberts, Kimberly Wyatt and Carmit Bachar. The group also went into reality television programs, a Las Vegas act, merchandising and other money making activites organized by Antin, Interscope, and their partners.

The Pussycat Dolls became famous around the world in 2005 with their album "PCD". It reached number five on the U.S. "Billboard" 200 Chart. The album included the hit singles "Don't Cha", "Buttons", and "Stickwitu"; a song that earned the group a Grammy Award nomination. After Carmit Bachar left the group in March 2008, the group continued as a quintet. They made their second album in 2008, "Doll Domination". This album included the singles "When I Grow Up", "I Hate This Part" and "Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)". The group has been criticized for being too sexual in their image and dances. Some people have said they use lead singer Nicole Scherzinger too often; she sings nearly all of the group's lead and background vocals.

Gumti River

Gumti River originates from Dumbur in the northeastern hilly region of the Tripura Division, that is part of the so-called Chittagonian angency. From its source it flows about 150 km along a meandering course through the hills, turns west and enters Bangladesh near Katak Bazar (Comilla Sadar). Then it takes a meandering course again and passes through the northern side of Comilla town and east of Mainamati. Keeping Burichang upazila on the north, it cuts through Debidwar upazila and reaches Companiganj Bazar. The distance from Mainamati to Companiganj Bazar is about 60 km. From Companiganj it turns west and finally falls into the Meghna River at Shapta in Daudkandi upazila. The segment between Companiganj and Daudkandi is about 50 km long. The Gumti is about 135 km long within Bangladesh. The dakatia is one of the important tributaries of the Gumti and the Buri River is its distributary.

The Gumti is a hilly river having a strong current. Its flow varies from 100 to 20,000 ft³/s at Comilla. During the rains its average breadth is about 100 m, it is full from bank to bank and the current is rapid. But during the winter it shrinks and becomes fordable at most places. In a year of normal rainfall the river rises to above 1.5 m than the level of the surrounding areas. Flash floods are common phenomena of this river and it occurs at regular intervals.

Birefringence

Birefringence (or double refraction) happens when light is passed through a special material and it splits into two different rays of light. Calcite crystals and boron nitride are two good examples of materials that cause birefringence. Just as a prism splits light into a large number of colors, birefringence splits light into two images of the same color. You see this as a "double image".

Polymer banknotes were created by the Reserve Bank of Australia, CSIRO and the University of Melbourne and were first used as money in Australia in 1988. These banknotes are made from polymer (plastic) which makes them last longer without getting ripped or torn, and they are harder to copy. Lots of countries now use polymer banknotes. Seven countries are now fully using polymer banknotes on all of their banknotes instead of paper. It is twice as expensive to make but lasts four times longer than paper banknotes. It is good for countries with lots of humidity, or wet countries, because the notes do not get damaged when it is wet.

Australian pound

The Australian Pound was the money of Australia from 1910 until 1966. It was made up of 20 shillings, with each shilling being 12 pence. In 1966 The Australian pound was replaced with the Australian dollar which had 100 cents to each dollar. 1 pound became 2 dollars, 1 shilling became 10 cents and 1 penny became 1 cent.

British coins were used until 1910, when Australian silver coins started to be made and used. There were florins, shillings, sixpences and threepences. They had an image of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom on one side. Australian pennies and half-pennies were started to be used the next year. In 1931 gold sovereigns, which had also been used before 1910, stopped being made in Australia. A crown (five shilling) coin was made for use between 1937 and 1938. People did not like them very much so you would not have seen them often after 1940.
By 1966, the coins being used were half pennies, pennies, threepences, sixpences, shillings and florins.

In the early 1800s, some banks printed their own paper money in Australia. The Queensland government and the New South Wales government also made paper money to be used in their states.

The first paper money to be used all over Australia were made by fifteen banks and the Queensland government made between 1910 and 1914. There were 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 Pound banknotes. They had "Australian Note" printed on them. None of the 100 pound notes are known to still exist.
In 1913 the first money to be printed and used by the Australian government were 10 shillings, 1 pound, 5 pounds and 10 pounds. In 1914 20 pounds, 50 pounds, 100 pounds and 1000 pounds were also printed. The 1000 pounds note was such a high value banknote that you could only use them in banks.

In the middle of the 1920s a new 10 shilling banknote (saying "Half Sovereign"), and smaller 1, 5 and 10 pound notes were made. They all had King George V of the United Kingdom on the front.

A new design was printed 1933 with King George V, also in 10 shillings, 1, 5 and 10 pounds. The notes were changed to have King George VI of the United Kingdom in 1938.

New notes in 1954 came when Queen Elizabeth II became Queen. There were 10 shillings, 1, 5 and 10 pound notes with images of Matthew Flinders on the 10 shilling note, Queen Elizabeth II on the 1 pound note, John Franklin on the 5 pound note and Arthur Phillip on the 10 pound note.

Octane rating

The Octane rating is a measurement of how well fuels (gasoline is a kind of fuel) resist detonation. Modern engines use high degrees of compression. They therefore need fuel that does not detonate easily. Such fuel has a higher octane rating. The rating is done by comparing the fuel to the mixture of iso-octane and heptane that would detonate in the same way. Such a mixture of 90 percent iso-octane and 10 percent heptane has an octane rating of 90. Europe gas octane high. US gas octane lower.

Pascal's Wager (or Pascal's Gambit) the name for an idea, Blaise Pascal had. He said that it is not possible to prove that God exists. Therefore, people must make a bet. If God existed, and the person believed in god, he would be rewarded (with happiness forever); if the person did not believe, he would be punished (with what is called "eternal damnation"). If God did not exist it would make no difference. For this reason, it would be better to believe in God, Pascal said. Indeed, Pascal strongly believed in this ideal. Pierre de Fermat along with himself created probability theory. 

This idea was very important for the time, because it did new things with probability theory. It is also one of the first tries to use the concept of infinity, and the first use of decision theory. It was important for other philosophers who developed the ideas of pragmatism and voluntarism.

Pig (dice)

Pig is a jeopardy (risk) dice game played with one die. In jeopardy dice games, a player decides to roll or hold (stop rolling). A player that rolls risks a turn total, and may gain a higher turn total or score nothing. A player that holds scores the turn total. 

John Scarne wrote about Pig as a common dice game in 1945. Optimal (perfect) play has been computed. 
Teachers often use Pig for fun lessons.

On a player's turn, a player can roll or hold:

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

For example, Ann begins a turn with a roll of 5. She could hold and score 5 points, but she decides to roll again. Next, Ann rolls a 2. She could hold with a turn total of 7 points (2 + 5 = 7), but she decides to roll again. Next, Ann rolls a 1 ("pig"). She must end her turn. Her score does not change. She hands the dice to the next player, Bob.

Bob rolls a 4, 5, 3, 5, and 5. He then decides to hold. Bob adds 4 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 22 points to his score.

Myware

Myware is the term given to applications that use spyware technologies but are designed to enable users to spy on themselves rather than others. The term was first coined by Seth Goldstein in 2005 to apply to his short-lived Attention Trust 
system. 

The term myware has mainly been applied to software applications in three areas: social networking, marketing and time tracking.

The first application to be described as myware was the Attention Trust system, which was launched in 2005 and allowed users to record their web clickstream and upload that information to Attention Trust. Since then, the term has been championed by the music social networking site Last.fm. They positioned themselves as “Musical Myware” to describe their process by which a user’s music listening habits were automatically recorded and uploaded. Last.fm use the data they gather for personalised music recommendations. Other uses of the term include time tracking application companies that describe themselves as myware to explain the automatic recording of PC activities for billing. 

Data collected by myware products typically includes: keystrokes, internet browsing patterns, web sites visited and the use of certain applications, such as music players for Last.fm. In each case, the user must choose to install the myware application and derive some benefit from the data recorded. This distinguishes myware from the more traditional spyware. However, there remains controversy over whether individual myware applications are really to the benefit of the user, particularly in cases where the user does not have editing access to the data recorded about themselves.
